# NBA Over/Unders Part 2: The Lakers/Bucks Divisions | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY)
*  All right, it's part two. We are doing the Pacific division to start. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=0.0s)]
*  That is the division that has both LA teams in it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3.48s)]
*  It also is the Phoenix Suns who have an over under. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=6.68s)]
*  Is that going up house? 47 and a half right now in Vandal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  I see 47 and a half. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=12.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=13.8s)]
*  They are plus 150 for the division, which to me is a bet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=15.08s)]
*  You don't know. Nobody knows. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=18.92s)]
*  They are 13 to one to be the one seed, which I think is semi enticing as like an [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=20.32s)]
*  okay. See backup bet. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=25.04s)]
*  And in general new coach coach bud is in town. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  They added Tyus Jones. They're finally going to have a point card. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=32.24s)]
*  I like Plumlee. I like Monty Morris. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  We're Sillo. I love this team. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  For the over. Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=41.92s)]
*  I think the 47 and a half is, is beyond tasty and beyond enticing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=43.64s)]
*  I think this is a low to mid fifties wind team. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=48.96s)]
*  Bud's going to add them shooting threes, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Durant Booker coming off the Olympics. I was out last year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=54.96s)]
*  I'm in this year. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=58.76s)]
*  When we last saw them by Minnesota, everybody laughing at him. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  I get it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=64.72s)]
*  Bradley Beal. It's funny. You want to look at like some misleading numbers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=65.0s)]
*  Look at Bradley Beal's like overall numbers and then [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  his splits and you know, all this stuff. Look, I'm with you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=72.92s)]
*  I am really impressed with what they were able to do on the margins, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=76.36s)]
*  considering they had no options to have Tyus Jones as an option. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=79.72s)]
*  You can have Booker on the ball later if you want to do that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=82.92s)]
*  Grace Allen was incredible. They kept Royce O'Neal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  This Ryan Dunn thing is even weirder. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=89.28s)]
*  Cause he was. Yeah, he's been a preseason. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=91.36s)]
*  Is this going to be like a Phil Pantier situation or do we believe this is, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=93.76s)]
*  it's a deep cut from early that is baseball. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm really excited about it, but like, look, there's no way here's, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=101.12s)]
*  here's why it's an over for me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=104.44s)]
*  They had the worst offense in the NBA in the fourth quarter and the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=106.12s)]
*  worst net rating of 30 NBA teams. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=111.04s)]
*  This team had the worst net rating in the fourth quarter. It makes no sense. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=113.36s)]
*  There's no way that happens again. I think it's an over because even through all [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=116.92s)]
*  of their nonsense, they won 49 games last year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=119.84s)]
*  It's a super over for me as well. I mean, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=123.68s)]
*  I think that the coach bud thing is the, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=125.92s)]
*  you know, one of the quieter developments in the West and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  what that does to propelling this team. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=135.24s)]
*  I think they're like going to be in that four seed, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  maybe even battling for the three seed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  I have them as a two seed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=141.8s)]
*  In the Western Conference? I do. Wow. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=144.36s)]
*  So that means you have them over Minnesota. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=147.96s)]
*  I have them right next to each other. And you have them over Dallas. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=149.72s)]
*  By the way, I like Vogel and I think he's a good coach who won a title. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=152.56s)]
*  I just think he was the wrong coach for that team. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=156.4s)]
*  It was terrible timing too. They threw that whole effing team together. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=158.44s)]
*  The team was never going to be good on defense, right? You bring in Vogel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=161.68s)]
*  It's like, he's going to bring in defensive and it's like, you know what? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=164.36s)]
*  This team's not going to be great on defense. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=167.28s)]
*  You know what they're going to be really good at? Offense. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=168.8s)]
*  And I think bud is just going to, you can see it. He's like, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=171.24s)]
*  shoot some fucking threes, get those threes up. That's it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=174.68s)]
*  Yeah. You're all good shooters and Bradley Beale, you know, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  if he can just play 60 games, he hasn't done that in five years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't even know if it matters with him. I'm serious. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm saying exactly, but that's what that's the, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=188.96s)]
*  that's the range between 51 and 55 wins for me. If he shows up. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  Can I read you some bud stats? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=195.92s)]
*  I love that people love bud again. Regular season bud. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  Won a title. Well, I'm going to give you some stats. Career, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  801 and 484. 60.4% winning percentage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  He had five 50 win seasons. Two of those were 60 plus. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  Here are all the coaches that have 800 plus wins, 60% winning percentage. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=215.56s)]
*  Phil Jackson, red are back. Steve Kerr, Greg Popovich, Pat Riley, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=220.28s)]
*  Jerry Sloan and coach bud. That's the entire list. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  It's a good coach. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=229.16s)]
*  The Milwaukee thing got super weird and you could go back and you could watch [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  those games and you could watch that Miami game, which I think blew your brain. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  You did. I think you just did a solo pod for like seven hours after that last [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=237.92s)]
*  Jimmy bother game. I think I did an emergency pod for that game. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't even, I think the pod accidentally turned on. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  You were just talking to yourself and we just somehow we're really good chance. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  That's also true. But yeah, I just think Milwaukee got weird. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  It was time for him to go. He seems, I like everything I've read about him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=256.76s)]
*  Everyone's like, this guy's in great shape. He was kind of a mess in Milwaukee. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=259.48s)]
*  Now he's now he's like refocused, needed the year off, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=263.08s)]
*  but this is like a mad scientist team. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=267.04s)]
*  This is a team that would be really fun to coach or a nightmare to coach if [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=269.48s)]
*  you're the wrong kind of coach for it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=273.64s)]
*  That's where I think the vocal part of it, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=274.88s)]
*  because it came together and these guys had all the answers. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=276.36s)]
*  So they weren't going to listen to Vogel and it's like, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=278.56s)]
*  actually you got embarrassed by like Ant, you guys. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=280.2s)]
*  So I think whoever the next coach was post-vogel is probably somebody they're [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=283.08s)]
*  going to respond to a little bit. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=287.32s)]
*  Cause I think they thought they had the plan last year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=288.76s)]
*  Right. We don't need, yeah, we just, just roll the ball out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=291.64s)]
*  Vogel was, if it were reversed, who knows? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=294.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, he has Nurgid's trying threes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to actually shoot them during the season, but. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=300.6s)]
*  I hope they get off to a good start. I do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  I hope they get off to a good start because I think the Durant stuff was [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=305.92s)]
*  heading towards weird town possibly this summer. But Phoenix, remember, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=308.76s)]
*  you and I were doing the pot around the draft. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=312.72s)]
*  ESPN was saying they wanted to trade them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  And then I had to even talk to somebody that said, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=316.56s)]
*  you can say right now in the pot with Bill tonight, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=318.48s)]
*  like we're not trading Durant. And I was like, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=320.68s)]
*  I hope you're not lying to me. And they weren't. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=323.68s)]
*  Nope. Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=325.16s)]
*  Look, as you know, I completely over-rate Olympic basketball at all times, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=327.48s)]
*  but I think it was good for Durant. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=330.88s)]
*  That's just the patriot in you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  I think it was good for Durant Booker that we had six dudes that in fucking [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=333.36s)]
*  nut crunch time that they trusted. And I thought it was a great experience for Booker. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=337.44s)]
*  That's my Booker position. Like all the Booker shit that I take. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=341.96s)]
*  It's a huge win for him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=345.2s)]
*  Booker, Tatum and everything. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=346.36s)]
*  Like there's a reason why I just, I stand up for this guy all the time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=347.76s)]
*  And Tias Jones, who I think the diehard league pass people, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=352.24s)]
*  and I include the three of us, like we really like that guy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=357.8s)]
*  And he was really good on Memphis and then house had him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=360.8s)]
*  That's all you could say. But still shot 40 over 41% from three on four times a game. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=365.2s)]
*  He, the whole philosophy of we don't need a point card. I've just, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  I will never believe that for the rest of my life. I think you need point cards. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  The Billy Miller of NBA point cards. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=377.28s)]
*  Who's Billy Miller? Oh, Billy Miller. Our Billy Miller. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=379.44s)]
*  Baseball Billy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=382.36s)]
*  Yeah. It's still amazing they got him. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=383.0s)]
*  It's amazing. It's because it seemed like... [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=386.52s)]
*  They had no outs and then it was okay. Resign and pay too much for this guy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=389.16s)]
*  Where was everyone else? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=393.16s)]
*  Like Monty Morris. I mean... [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=394.44s)]
*  That's another one. Yeah. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  They did a good job. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  New owner syndrome is back. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=399.56s)]
*  Ishbia is fucking making moves, man. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=403.24s)]
*  I'm in on this son's team. So we're all over 47 and a half. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=406.36s)]
*  My guess we have like eight, nine days left. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that keeps going up. I bet that lands when people watch what the sons are [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=412.16s)]
*  doing and how many threes they're taking. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=416.56s)]
*  They're going to be really hard to play. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=418.4s)]
*  The thing that makes me nervous is Durant. He was in 2007 draft. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=420.12s)]
*  We were watching a game last night. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=423.4s)]
*  Remember the show Greg Oden and the Stans? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Greg Oden just like an old retired player and he was in the draft with Durant. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=427.56s)]
*  So it's just, once you get into year 18, year 19, I never feel awesome. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=432.64s)]
*  But I think... [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=437.68s)]
*  Is Booker like a stealth, stealth, stealth MVP candidate? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=440.4s)]
*  Like super duper long shot? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=444.8s)]
*  I don't know. Like if they're going right, it probably means Durant is cooking again. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=448.24s)]
*  I mean, he was 52, 41, 86 and 70 games last year. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=452.68s)]
*  I mean, Durant, but then to watch what happened in Minnesota, you're like, okay, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=456.12s)]
*  this isn't working out. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  They have odds for him too. 75 to one. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=460.8s)]
*  You don't have to sell me on Booker. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=463.76s)]
*  Booker, 100 to one. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=465.04s)]
*  Nah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=466.44s)]
*  If they're a one or a two seed, they're at least going to be in the conversation. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  I just think those are crazy values for a team that I think can be the two seed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=470.56s)]
*  All right. Next team's Sacramento. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=474.48s)]
*  Their overs 44 and a half, which went down. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=477.0s)]
*  I think it was 45 and a half. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  Many of them got 46 and a half. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=480.48s)]
*  They're plus 240 for the division. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=483.24s)]
*  They're minus 170 for the playoffs. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=486.52000000000004s)]
*  They were 46 and 36 last year. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=488.0s)]
*  And what they did was they turned Harrison Barnes into Demarco Rosen. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=490.32s)]
*  And they start Sabonis and Murray and DeRozan and Fox and maybe Ellis, Monk coming off the bench. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=495.04s)]
*  Monk, Monk. Monk, Monk. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=500.56s)]
*  You're going to get it down this year? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  Monk. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=504.48s)]
*  You're going to try it again? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=505.64000000000004s)]
*  Monk. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=506.24s)]
*  Trey Lyles is there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you think the origin of that is? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  I just, listen, I can't control my, my. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  I have weird ones too. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  I have a weird. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=514.32s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  Weird one. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=515.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=516.24s)]
*  So this team, I don't know why they were 40 and 34 two years ago and 46, 36 last year. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=517.6s)]
*  When I did my Ringer 100 voting, I had them 19, 27, 46, 90 and 97. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=525.84s)]
*  I had five of their guys in the top hundred, including two in the top 30. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=532.6s)]
*  They also have some trade bait. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=536.72s)]
*  Herder's 16.8. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=538.0s)]
*  They have Lyles. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=540.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=540.96s)]
*  If you want to ruin your entire team's chemistry. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=541.08s)]
*  Carter. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=543.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=543.6s)]
*  Five. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=543.96s)]
*  I should have given you a warning on that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  But they have moves they can make to get one more guy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=546.16s)]
*  And I, I think I'm over. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=548.32s)]
*  I think they're a top eight team. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=549.84s)]
*  I like their team. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=551.96s)]
*  I think they're going to be hard to play. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=552.76s)]
*  I'm an over, slight over, but I think the DeRozan thing raises their floor because Harrison [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=554.84s)]
*  Barnes would also be a first team selection of did he play tonight? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=558.96s)]
*  And be like, you just watch him play 38 minutes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=562.16s)]
*  It felt like he was getting a little worse too. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  So, um, it makes sense for San Antonio, but when I run through it, I mean, they've got [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=565.4s)]
*  kind of a key on Ellis like thing where, you know, they probably really liked his defense, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=569.92s)]
*  which also made them feel like they can move on from Davion Mitchell, who they'd spent [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=575.8s)]
*  a lottery pick on who like, let's face it, he's probably a rotational guard. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=578.88s)]
*  And then we're going to be a starter for anybody that was pretty good. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=582.12s)]
*  So, you know, DeRozan three years ago, the Chicago deal, I thought, man, we'll see how [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=584.2399999999999s)]
*  that ages out and it aged out beautifully for them. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=588.28s)]
*  I just like where it puts their floor. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=591.72s)]
*  They're going to try to run you up and down. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  They're not going to be able to defend anybody like who cares about the playoff [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=596.32s)]
*  projection for them and playing bigger teams like we saw against New Orleans last [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=599.12s)]
*  year, where it was just like one of those moments where you go, this is an awful [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  matchup for him every time they play. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  I just think DeRozan, you plugging him into those Barnes minutes and Fox and the rest [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  of everybody else is young. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=612.72s)]
*  I'm not going to let- [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  There was a lot on Fox last year at the end of games too. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=616.36s)]
*  House. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=616.96s)]
*  No, and that's DeRozan. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=617.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=618.4000000000001s)]
*  You want to talk about it in the games? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  Which is kind of fine, right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=619.1600000000001s)]
*  Two places to go. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=620.08s)]
*  House, really good league pass team. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=620.68s)]
*  I could see you falling asleep in front of the couch in the East coast for many times. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=622.56s)]
*  Well, I need to see- [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=626.24s)]
*  Isaac Jones. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=627.28s)]
*  The red mamba at all times. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=628.08s)]
*  Maryland guy, the red mamba, Kevin Hoerter. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=629.8s)]
*  So if he's in the minutes- [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=632.68s)]
*  Not a lot of people predicting a comeback here. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=633.68s)]
*  I don't know if you want to do an investor relations call. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=635.56s)]
*  Want me to call one in quick? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=639.56s)]
*  It's a tiny bit of stock. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=640.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=642.24s)]
*  Kevin Hoerter investor relations call. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=643.84s)]
*  Bracillo, you're actually compromised here. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=646.56s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=651.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=653.8s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=655.4s)]
*  When you're on your boat in 20 years, you've sold all your comedy CDs. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=657.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=661.0s)]
*  You're doing pretty good. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=661.8s)]
*  You got a boat. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=662.56s)]
*  Do you want to look at the guy's boat next to you and you want that guy's boat to be [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=664.16s)]
*  bigger or smaller? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=667.4s)]
*  Because if you get out of this herder position now, you're going to be a fucking tender. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=668.64s)]
*  You're going to be running groceries and shrimp and ice to that guy's boat. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=673.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=676.4000000000001s)]
*  If you want the guy next to you running the supplies to you, asking anything else I [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=677.24s)]
*  can do for you. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  That's why you're staying in this herder position right now. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=683.4000000000001s)]
*  You want to get out like everybody else who's going to be in the small boat. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=685.44s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  Fucking grab some oars. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=688.64s)]
*  Grab some oars. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a league that loves shooting. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=690.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=692.24s)]
*  Maybe you get in a sailing and I'm talking emergency sailing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=692.52s)]
*  You want something high powered, generators, the whole deal. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=696.2s)]
*  Hold. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=700.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  To hold. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a herder hold. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=703.2800000000001s)]
*  We're doing it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=704.2800000000001s)]
*  We all love shooting. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  I love guys who can make open threes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=705.72s)]
*  So you're over house? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=708.12s)]
*  I'm over because you side by side the Pelicans and this team. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=709.1600000000001s)]
*  And I like this team better than I like the Pelicans. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  I have the answers that I want to what this roster is going to look like. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=716.8000000000001s)]
*  And also when you're plugging into Rosen, like you want to talk about something I've [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  never even worried about. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=725.1600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=726.88s)]
*  Like, okay, cool. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=727.2s)]
*  Like he'll just get along with everybody and he's better than the guys you're [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=728.76s)]
*  replacing. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=731.2s)]
*  And also plays really well against good teams. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=731.6s)]
*  Every time he played the Celtics, I always felt like I had so many problems with him. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  And the Celtics were like, you would think the perfect type of team to defend him, but [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=739.48s)]
*  he always got shots. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=742.6400000000001s)]
*  They were like, I have them as in that six, seven, eight range. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=743.6s)]
*  For seeds, maybe even getting a six if Memphis can't totally get their shit together. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=751.24s)]
*  So I probably had them six, but I think in that next batch of once you get past OKC [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  Phoenix, Minnesota, Dallas, Denver, and you go into that Memphis, Sacramento, Houston, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=763.4s)]
*  Gold State, New Orleans, Lakers, that group, I think I like them the most. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=767.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=772.16s)]
*  Also really good home court. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=773.4s)]
*  Like it matters. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=775.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=776.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a team that will probably give a shit during the NBA Cup. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=776.68s)]
*  I'm not positive everyone's going to care, but I think they will. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=780.5999999999999s)]
*  I like this. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=782.76s)]
*  So, look at that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=784.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=784.92s)]
*  We're overs for all of them. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=785.16s)]
*  We're going to keep moving. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  Golden State Warriors. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=787.8s)]
*  I mean, one of the toughest over-unders on the board. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  Do we all like what they did this off season considering? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=792.64s)]
*  43 and a half is the over. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=796.68s)]
*  So, so the Fandl didn't like it as much because they won 46 games last year. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=798.3599999999999s)]
*  I like the over. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  You like the over. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  I liked it at 42 and a half more than 43 and a half because I think it's [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=805.68s)]
*  a perfect number for this. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=809.24s)]
*  Let me throw this at you. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  On January 1st, they were 15 and 17. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=812.68s)]
*  It was something I was tracking for them in particular. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=814.8s)]
*  From that point on, they went 39, excuse me. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=817.52s)]
*  They were 15 and 17 on January 1st. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=820.12s)]
*  They went 31 and 19 the last 15. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=821.6s)]
*  They were eighth in net rating. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's what Draymond playing 55 games. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  I like the depth. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=828.88s)]
*  I like the multiple options that they have with these different mixes and [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=830.12s)]
*  matches that they're going to do. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=834.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=836.36s)]
*  I would hope that Draymond, I mean, he doesn't seem super like, he's never going [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  to be regretful, he's like defiantly not regretful about any mistakes he'd make. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=843.0400000000001s)]
*  But I don't know that he's going to have the same kind of season like that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=846.8s)]
*  And then you just kind of plug Steph in here again. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=849.5999999999999s)]
*  So I think when you look at that run over the last 50 games, that's what [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=851.64s)]
*  they talked themselves into and they- [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=855.8s)]
*  It's a pretty big sample size. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=857.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=858.24s)]
*  So I'm going over. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=858.7199999999999s)]
*  One of the reasons I went over and the over is 43 and a half is because of [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  the depth that he just mentioned. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=866.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=867.92s)]
*  They go 12 deep. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  What's interesting is in that ringer hundred exercise, they only had two [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=870.0s)]
*  guys for me in the- [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=873.64s)]
*  Draymond. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=874.88s)]
*  I think two guys. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=875.24s)]
*  Draymond and Curry. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  Podziemski and Curry. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=876.6s)]
*  Well, and then Podziemski maybe has a chance to play himself in there. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=877.6800000000001s)]
*  I couldn't quite put Kaminga in there. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=880.96s)]
*  But, but when you think they're starting Draymond, Kaminga, Wiggins, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=882.9200000000001s)]
*  Podziemski, Curry, they're bringing in Slow Mo off the bench. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=886.6s)]
*  Looney. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=890.32s)]
*  Jackson Davis. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=891.0400000000001s)]
*  Melton. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=892.12s)]
*  Healed. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=892.96s)]
*  Jackson Davis. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  Moody. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=895.16s)]
*  Gary Payton the second. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=896.12s)]
*  I think you need to think this way in the regular season or the third. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=898.52s)]
*  Either one. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=902.28s)]
*  I thought it was the second. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=903.96s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=905.08s)]
*  Um, I thought this really helped the Celtics last year. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=906.0s)]
*  Depth, giving guys nights off and then having people come in who could actually [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=909.88s)]
*  like hold the fort, the Wears are going to be the best example of this. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=913.96s)]
*  They're just deep. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=916.52s)]
*  I think you need to be deep in 2024. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=917.6s)]
*  House, where do you stand? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=920.2s)]
*  Um, I agree with the idea of the depth. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=921.36s)]
*  The depth doesn't really blow me away. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=924.16s)]
*  Um, a couple of guys have been in a couple of places, haven't really [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=926.04s)]
*  distinguished themselves. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=928.9200000000001s)]
*  Everybody's for that right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  Buddy Healed, Wiggins. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=931.04s)]
*  Everybody's waiting for Buddy Healed to really be that guy that's, you know, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=932.08s)]
*  knocking down six threes again, you know, whatever. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=934.88s)]
*  What happened the last two years with Buddy Healed? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=937.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=938.8s)]
*  Why couldn't he get off the bench? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=939.04s)]
*  I like it in theory so much more than the basketball. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=940.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=942.2s)]
*  Those Sixers games, we were like, dude, and he had the one after everybody was so [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=942.36s)]
*  frustrated that he didn't want to seem like he wanted to shoot. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=946.48s)]
*  Do you think Buddy Healed's agent called the Sixers or just was like, yeah, I [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=948.8s)]
*  don't even need to call. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=953.08s)]
*  They did the token call. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=954.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=956.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=956.4s)]
*  Hey, it's Bob. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=956.64s)]
*  Hey, Darrell. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=958.2s)]
*  Um, just checking in. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=958.84s)]
*  I know it wasn't a great season for Buddy, but, uh, you know, if you want to [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=960.92s)]
*  talk about a deal, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=965.12s)]
*  Golden State's an under for me. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=967.64s)]
*  Um, because I don't think Steph's going to play 74 games. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=969.04s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=972.84s)]
*  I mean, I love Steph. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=974.0s)]
*  I want to see him play as much basketball as possible. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=975.4s)]
*  Uh, I hope he plays, but they have no margin for error if he doesn't play. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=978.24s)]
*  None. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=983.48s)]
*  There's no backup plan. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=984.4399999999999s)]
*  No, they're screwed. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=985.92s)]
*  Kaminga is balling out. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=986.72s)]
*  Oh, congratulations. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=988.8s)]
*  I mean, my big question with this team was, did they find a younger, deeper, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  happier version of themselves? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=995.16s)]
*  Cause I don't think last year, last two years were not exactly like super happy. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=997.12s)]
*  And they had a lot of guns for hire and just weird kinds of, I don't know if I [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1001.4s)]
*  pick them against anybody in the playoffs. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1004.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1007.48s)]
*  But all we care about is regular season. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1007.76s)]
*  They don't make the playoffs two of the last four years. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1010.4s)]
*  The bigger question to me is, is this just a trade machine team? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1014.0s)]
*  They couldn't get a deal that they like this summer. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1017.04s)]
*  They put together a lot of assets and they're just open for business, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1018.96s)]
*  really starting Thanksgiving. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1022.2s)]
*  Who wants what they have? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1023.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, they have a bunch of picks. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1025.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1026.68s)]
*  It would be Kaminga continuing to improve. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  And then he's in the deal with, here's all of our picks. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1030.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1034.32s)]
*  And expiring contracts. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1034.56s)]
*  And, um, I'm not talking Zach Levin level. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1036.32s)]
*  Obviously they weren't interested in Ingram, but if an actual star becomes [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1039.88s)]
*  available, they try the Paul George thing, but I just don't think there was ever a [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1043.16s)]
*  fit there. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1046.24s)]
*  And I think there was a bunch of teams that tried on Lowry that were offering [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1046.76s)]
*  real things and then it didn't happen. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1050.16s)]
*  But, uh, it would have to be somebody like, and can we stop with the Steph [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1053.68s)]
*  LeBron stuff that they're going to play together at some point? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1057.6s)]
*  That doesn't really make sense. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1061.0s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1063.24s)]
*  We just watched it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1063.76s)]
*  It was the Olympics. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1064.4s)]
*  They're not playing together. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1065.28s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1066.96s)]
*  Steph got hoes in the MVP. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1067.24s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1071.68s)]
*  Warriors playoffs minus 102. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1073.04s)]
*  No. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1075.52s)]
*  Plus 120 is the no. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1075.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1077.4s)]
*  Plus game. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1077.6000000000001s)]

*  Rosilla. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1079.92s)]
*  This team looks very plain. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  I hate the playing game because it keeps getting rid of Steph. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1082.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1085.96s)]
*  It's stupid. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1086.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, like, oh great. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  10 playoff teams. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1091.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1092.6000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1093.0s)]
*  Span the team, the playoffs to 10. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1093.28s)]
*  So that we had it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1094.76s)]
*  Warriors can get in. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1095.52s)]
*  I'm trying to think now, if I look at it again, um, Golden State wouldn't even [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1096.52s)]
*  have been in the playoffs last year. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1101.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1102.16s)]
*  But so I think it was, was it 22 when I was at home and I went, cool. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1102.32s)]
*  Now Steph's not in the playoffs. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1107.6s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1109.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1110.72s)]
*  I think it was 22. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1110.84s)]
*  That was the Lakers game. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1111.6s)]
*  Over for me. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1115.08s)]
*  Over for Rosilla. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1116.0s)]
*  Under for house. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1117.08s)]
*  Under 43 and a half for me. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1118.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1120.08s)]
*  And that leads us to. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1121.6399999999999s)]
*  21. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  The Los Angeles Lakers. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1125.3999999999999s)]
*  Los Angeles Lakers. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1127.12s)]
*  The Lakers of Los Angeles. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1129.32s)]
*  42 and a half is the over under their plus 440 for the division. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  Minus 110 for the playoffs. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1136.0s)]

*  They added JJ Reddick as a new coach. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1140.48s)]
*  They added Dalton connect. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1143.68s)]
*  They lost in witty. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  They lost Prince. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1146.24s)]
*  It's pretty much the same team except the coach James. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1147.2s)]
*  That's somebody else. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1150.5600000000002s)]
*  Who'd you got? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1152.44s)]
*  Well, Coloco. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1152.92s)]
*  Coloco? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1155.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1156.68s)]
*  That Arizona kid, big guy. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1156.92s)]
*  I liked him a couple years ago. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1158.92s)]
*  Throw in Coloco. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1161.0s)]
*  So JJ wants to shoot more threes. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1162.52s)]
*  Will this work? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1164.64s)]
*  They were incredibly lucky last year. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  So they're 47 and 35. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1169.88s)]
*  They were expected 42 and 40. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  So they played over that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1174.0800000000002s)]
*  This is a super easy one for me. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1175.44s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1177.04s)]
*  Anthony Davis here back on the map. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1177.72s)]
*  LeBron makes it through all the way healthy. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1179.72s)]
*  The fact that they got that from those two guys and they still are just kind [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1181.4s)]
*  of LeBron at his best shooting year, probably ever from three. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1184.3600000000001s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1187.72s)]
*  I'm not banking on that again. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1188.8400000000001s)]
*  So it's an under. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1190.16s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1191.3200000000002s)]
*  How's it? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1192.52s)]
*  It's so effing low. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1193.24s)]
*  42 and a half is so goddamn low. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1195.0s)]
*  But if one of the two guys goes down, got it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1198.4s)]
*  71 for LeBron last year. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1201.72s)]
*  76 for Anthony Davis. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1203.96s)]
*  76 games for Anthony Davis last year. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1206.28s)]
*  L. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1209.68s)]
*  Um, Reddick does want Davis to be shooting more threes. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1209.96s)]
*  Does that help? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1213.48s)]
*  Does that keep him on the court? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1214.2s)]
*  If Anthony Davis is shooting threes? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1215.64s)]
*  They were eighth in three point percentage last year, but they only [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1217.6399999999999s)]
*  took 31 threes a game. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1220.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  So on paper you're like, well, shoot more. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1222.1999999999998s)]
*  And we'll, but so they're playing Davis who shot, I think 27% from three last [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1224.04s)]
*  year, Vanderbilt who can't shoot, Camaradish who can't shoot, Wood who can't shoot. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1228.76s)]
*  And Gabe Vincent, who only really had one decent three point shooting here. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  And then LeBron was career high. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1236.84s)]
*  And then Russell was like, cool, can I shoot more threes? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1238.4799999999998s)]
*  That's where you, so I can shoot eight. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1241.12s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1243.7199999999998s)]
*  Could I be like Steph? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1244.52s)]
*  Um, I don't think it's going to work. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1246.28s)]
*  And I just think it's a team that doesn't make sense to me. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1248.1599999999999s)]
*  The 33 games that Russell Reeves, Rui, LeBron and AD, um, were the starting five. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1251.84s)]
*  They went 23 and 10. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1259.56s)]
*  So that's your case for this team. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1261.52s)]
*  And God, 42 and a half is so goddamn low. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1264.12s)]
*  So you're going to the AD three point thing. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1267.6s)]
*  I don't know if that's kind of the Royal jelly deal or the old Sean [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1269.6s)]
*  Marion thing with D'Antoni where D'Antoni would just be like, as soon [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1273.88s)]
*  as you catch it, let it fly. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1276.5200000000002s)]
*  It actually just made Marion a better shooter because it was something you [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1277.8400000000001s)]
*  never, it was never a bad idea for him to shoot. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1281.44s)]
*  So I don't know if that's, I have a hard time to believe it's going to be that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1284.44s)]
*  freewheeling as the seven seconds are left Phoenix Suns here, but Davis hasn't [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1287.5200000000002s)]
*  been able to hit it from the outside now since New Orleans. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  There's only one case for the over for me because I think this, I actually [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1294.64s)]
*  think this team's going to be in the mid to high thirties. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1297.96s)]
*  I just don't think, especially with how deep the West is LeBron, his age, the [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1300.28s)]
*  fact that he's, you know, he's going to miss 25, 26 games because that's just [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1304.28s)]
*  what's been happening in the last few years. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  Except for not last year, but Davis getting Davis getting, he's going to be 40. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1310.44s)]
*  I don't, I mean, did he look slow to you in the Olympics? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1315.44s)]
*  If he plays that well, they had six games in the Olympics. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1318.36s)]
*  The games are 40 minutes. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1321.24s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1323.68s)]
*  And I even fell for it during the Olympics. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1324.36s)]
*  Like it was a little bit of fool's gold where you, you had to play 60. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1326.36s)]
*  And those guys hadn't played basketball in 10 months and they were just [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1329.24s)]
*  working on their bodies in shape. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1332.04s)]
*  And then it was this brief sprint. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1333.68s)]
*  This is an 82 game season in a really good league. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1335.28s)]
*  That's as deep as it's ever been. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1338.16s)]
*  I think it's a lot to ask to run everything through LeBron at his age at this point. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1340.16s)]
*  I went over on them the last two years. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1344.8s)]
*  I don't see it this year. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1346.52s)]
*  I, they barely squeaked that over last year. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1347.84s)]
*  It was a miracle. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1349.92s)]
*  So the only case for it was so low is that they don't have their pick. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1350.84s)]
*  Their, their first round pick goes to New Orleans. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1355.08s)]
*  They're going to be in the mid to high thirties. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1356.96s)]
*  They don't have to play assimism in the late turning 20s though. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1358.76s)]
*  I mean, everybody must've gotten that on foods yesterday. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1361.28s)]
*  LikeNOUNCER'SLEEP, in mentioned the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1363.04s)]
* asses have been out for a year . [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1373.12s)]
*  twitter, J. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1375.36s)]
*  I'm under. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1376.92s)]
*  I thought you were going over. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1378.0800000000002s)]
*  42 or 40. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1378.92s)]
*  It's such a low number, it's absurd. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1379.76s)]
*  But how do you forecast? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1381.68s)]
*  Somebody's gotta be bad in the West. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1383.24s)]
*  Well it's interesting. 147 games again [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1384.64s)]
*  out of those two guys. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1386.44s)]
*  If they were in the East, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1387.28s)]
*  would they be in eight seed for you guys? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1388.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I think so. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1391.4s)]
*  Against like Atlanta, Miami. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1392.24s)]
*  I still don't think they, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1393.48s)]
*  I would have Miami over them in the East. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1394.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh God, that's disrespectful. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1395.96s)]
*  Well, we'll talk about that. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1397.24s)]
*  That's very disrespectful. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1398.0800000000002s)]
*  All right, we're all going under. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1398.92s)]
*  Russel, is this Zach Levine panic trade waiting to happen? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1400.8000000000002s)]
*  43 million this year. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1404.28s)]
*  LeBron's always like them. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  So. So yes. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1408.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it's gonna be really aggressive. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1409.72s)]
*  Like the passive aggressive. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1412.5200000000002s)]
*  It's gonna be super passive aggressive. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1413.96s)]
*  LeBron, if he's putting it together [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1416.16s)]
*  and there are a few games out or wherever they are [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1417.8400000000001s)]
*  and they own their picks [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1420.24s)]
*  and people thought that was gonna happen this summer. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1421.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1423.92s)]
*  I just don't understand why you'd be, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1424.76s)]
*  if LeBron were 30, I'd be giving into him. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1426.0400000000002s)]
*  I'd do whatever he wants. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1428.0s)]
*  I'd draft his kid. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1429.24s)]
*  But I don't understand the purpose of like, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1430.24s)]
*  let's do whatever this guy wants at 40 years old. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1432.76s)]
*  Even though he's pushed the boundaries [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1435.04s)]
*  of what we think is possible. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1436.32s)]
*  You know. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1437.72s)]
*  They're gonna hit a dangerous spot, the Laker fans, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1438.76s)]
*  because you can't really mortgage anything else. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1441.08s)]
*  We've already seen that the ceiling of this team [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1443.68s)]
*  is what it is. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1445.64s)]
*  The teams around them are getting better. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1446.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1449.24s)]
*  I don't know if it's an ESPN. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1450.08s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1450.92s)]
*  Like I'll see a clip pop out like it did [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1451.76s)]
*  and be like, so and so doesn't like their championship. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1453.04s)]
*  And I'm like, why are you getting, what? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1455.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1457.24s)]
*  No one's even thinking about that anymore. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1458.08s)]
*  There's a separate league with OKC in Minnesota [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1458.92s)]
*  and Dallas and the Celtics and the Knicks. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1461.08s)]
*  Like this team would have no chance. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1463.24s)]
*  This is not. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1464.8400000000001s)]
*  No, yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1465.68s)]
*  It's a no serious person talks about the Lakers [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1466.52s)]
*  in like with a playoff run. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1469.52s)]
*  Well ESPN, well. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1471.28s)]
*  It's probably leading NBA today today. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1472.68s)]
*  Well, ESPN let, you know, a guy no longer works for them. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  Hijacked the first game of the goddamn NBA finals [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1480.04s)]
*  with Laker news about the head coach [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1483.28s)]
*  that never was gonna effing land there. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  But great, great job. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1488.04s)]
*  So that's definitely the. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1489.32s)]
*  Let our perspective be colored by ESPN's editorial decisions. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1493.28s)]
*  The house is really letting them have it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1496.92s)]
*  Were you in the PA program in the late 90s? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1498.3600000000001s)]
*  I was so upset. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1500.3600000000001s)]
*  It was the NBA finals that are doing a car wash of like, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1501.2s)]
*  well, we're really gonna put the Connecticut coach, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1504.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, to the test to be the potential. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1507.48s)]
*  House does like car washes. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1509.6000000000001s)]
*  Coach of the Lakers. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1510.44s)]
*  Get the eff out of here. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1511.48s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1512.64s)]
*  I just wanna watch the finals. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1513.48s)]

*  Well, the Lakers won't be one of them [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1516.1200000000001s)]
*  and neither will be this next team, the Los Angeles Clippers. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1517.92s)]
*  Over 37 and a half. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1521.44s)]
*  I feel like that's dropped. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1523.2s)]
*  I think that was higher before Kawhi was like. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  It was 38 and a half, it was. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1526.96s)]
*  Kawhi was like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1528.3200000000002s)]

*  Just like, oh, that's this year we're doing that? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1539.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1542.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, wasn't there a lockout? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1543.2s)]
*  Yeah, we're having dinner after. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1544.8400000000001s)]
*  We are. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1545.92s)]
*  12 to one for the division. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1549.24s)]
*  Plus 2.35 to make the playoffs. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1551.48s)]
*  Plus 1.85 for the play-in. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1555.28s)]
*  And last year there were 51 and 31. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1558.0800000000002s)]
*  They lost Paul George, they lost Plumlee. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1559.8400000000001s)]
*  They added Derek Jones, Chris Dunn, Nick Batum. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1561.52s)]
*  Can you imagine having season tickets for these guys? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1570.52s)]
*  It looks like an incredible stadium. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1573.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think getting to watch the West, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1575.2s)]

*  Going for the other teams. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1580.96s)]

*  Wemby's in town, let's go. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1583.32s)]
*  The stadium all by itself, I think. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1584.44s)]
*  The way it looks, the reports so far, it seems like. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1586.52s)]
*  You've already gone? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1589.12s)]
*  The guy I shared tickets with went yesterday [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1590.76s)]
*  and was sending me videos. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1592.3999999999999s)]
*  I was like, that looks fucking amazing. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1593.36s)]
*  So you haven't been yet? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1594.48s)]
*  I haven't been, can't wait. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1595.44s)]
*  Are you going tomorrow night? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1596.76s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1597.8s)]
*  Or Thursday? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1598.6399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1599.48s)]
*  Why, you wanna go? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1600.32s)]
*  Into it? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1602.0s)]
*  I'm tempted. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1602.84s)]
*  You guys should go. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1603.68s)]
*  The stadium is the thing. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1604.52s)]
*  Tell me, cause I have to leave now to get there in time. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1606.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's actually- [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1609.88s)]
*  Ways of staying 26 hours. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1610.72s)]
*  I've been boycotting London football. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  So I'm like- [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1614.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, smart. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1615.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1616.48s)]
*  I like it. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1617.3200000000002s)]
*  All right, here's the season ticket package [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1618.16s)]
*  other than the arena. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1620.8400000000001s)]
*  An aging high usage James Harden, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1622.64s)]
*  probably my least favorite player to watch in person [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1625.48s)]
*  of all the good players. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1627.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't know if there's a player more excited [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1628.4s)]
*  about this upcoming season. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1630.0400000000002s)]
*  He's like, Kawhi, take your time. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1630.88s)]
*  Limping Kawhi, a bunch of role guys, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1631.96s)]
*  and they have no first round pick. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1634.0400000000002s)]
*  They don't control the draft for the next five years? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1635.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1637.5200000000002s)]
*  It's brutal. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1638.7199999999998s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1639.56s)]
*  It's brutal. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1640.3999999999999s)]
*  But the stadium's gonna be amazing. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1641.3999999999999s)]
*  And they basically chose James Harden over Paul George. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1644.4799999999998s)]
*  Which is just bizarre. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1648.52s)]
*  I thought the Harden number was a little high [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1649.4399999999998s)]
*  and I still can't believe [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1651.24s)]
*  they didn't do a fourth year with Paul George. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1652.08s)]
*  But I could also see them being entirely over this thing [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1653.7199999999998s)]
*  that has not worked out, even though at the time, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1657.3999999999999s)]
*  if you're trading all of this for Paul George, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1660.08s)]
*  also guarantees you getting Kawhi Leonard and free agency. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1661.84s)]
*  You do it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1665.1999999999998s)]
*  You just do it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1666.28s)]
*  I don't think it's- [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1667.12s)]
*  Anyone that's going, you shouldn't have done it [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1668.52s)]
*  after the fact, just think. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1670.88s)]
*  You gave all that up to then get Paul George [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1672.48s)]
*  and then to have all of this stuff happen. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1675.1200000000001s)]
*  But the Kawhi part of it, it hasn't been right since Toronto [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1676.76s)]
*  and it's really unfortunate [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1679.3600000000001s)]
*  because it looked like they finally executed the plan [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1681.56s)]
*  you hoped to be able to do one time. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1684.72s)]
*  They sent Kawhi home from the Olympic team. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1687.8400000000001s)]
*  They were like, let's make up an excuse. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1691.4s)]
*  You can't be in the team. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1693.1200000000001s)]
*  You need an e-surgery. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1694.96s)]
*  You can't be in the team. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1695.8s)]
*  You're not healthy. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1696.64s)]
*  And then the pre-season started and it's like, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1698.0s)]
*  still not healthy, but he's going to be ready [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1699.88s)]
*  for opening night. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1702.16s)]
*  And then it's like, no, he's actually not going [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1703.0s)]
*  to be ready opening night either. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1704.32s)]
*  Where's season tickets for 2024 or 2025? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1706.32s)]
*  Draft? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1710.68s)]
*  Is what, we don't need to do a draft [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1711.52s)]
*  because there's only five teams. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1712.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1714.24s)]
*  But who do you have first? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1715.08s)]
*  Who would you want to have season tickets for the least? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1716.52s)]
*  This is the easiest question. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1719.32s)]
*  It's obviously Washington. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1721.04s)]
*  The Wizards are running Yama in this draft. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1722.24s)]
*  I had them as well. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1724.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1724.84s)]
*  Is Brooklyn too? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1725.92s)]
*  Is, well, you were just there. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1728.32s)]
*  There's good pizza places there, right? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1730.68s)]
*  Really good food. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1732.4s)]
*  So you got- [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1733.24s)]
*  Feeny Pizza. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1734.08s)]
*  No, I don't think Brooklyn's too. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1734.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1736.2s)]
*  Ben Simmons. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1737.04s)]
*  Roster? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1737.88s)]
*  Brooklyn's too. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1738.72s)]
*  I'm just saying season tickets. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1739.56s)]
*  I have to go to the stadium. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1740.68s)]
*  I have to see this team for the next six months. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1742.0s)]
*  I'm going for the other teams. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1744.16s)]
*  I think it would be Portland. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1745.0s)]
*  I think it's Charlotte. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1746.28s)]
*  Oh, that's a great point. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1747.68s)]
*  I kind of like Charlotte. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1748.8s)]
*  Oh, we're going to have a fun conversation. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1750.32s)]
*  I wouldn't mind going to see Charlotte. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1752.2s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't say season tickets and then go, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1753.72s)]
*  but there's a lot of golf in the area. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1756.0s)]
*  Like it's about the basketball. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1757.8s)]
*  I'm not talking about that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1758.64s)]
*  I'm saying I'm going to the game. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1759.48s)]
*  Do I like watching the players in the court? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1760.76s)]
*  So Brooklyn, you want it? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1763.36s)]
*  The pizza's so good that you're going to watch [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1764.48s)]
*  41 of those games? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1766.28s)]
*  No, I had Brooklyn second. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1767.12s)]
*  I had Brooklyn second. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1767.96s)]
*  Okay, we have Brooklyn second. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1768.8s)]
*  We're on the same page. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1769.88s)]
*  I have the Clippers third. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1770.72s)]
*  I'd rather see Chicago than the Clippers. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1772.44s)]
*  They're like, Josh Giddy, Kobe White. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1776.04s)]
*  You do want to see Kobe White. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1777.88s)]
*  Butzellas. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1778.72s)]
*  I think Toronto needs to be mentioned. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1779.56s)]
*  Oh. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1781.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1782.8s)]
*  Over Portland? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1783.64s)]
*  He went right there. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1784.48s)]
*  I have a lot invested emotionally in Portland. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1785.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1787.84s)]
*  So if I were there rooting on my guys. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1788.6799999999998s)]
*  So you'd have Toronto fourth? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1790.0s)]
*  It's freezing. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1792.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1794.4399999999998s)]
*  All right, Toronto fourth. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1795.28s)]
*  Like, oh cool, quickly took 27 shots. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1796.6399999999999s)]
*  Scotty Barnes's crunch time numbers are getting better. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1800.9199999999998s)]
*  Well that's Scotty Barnes. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1805.04s)]
*  I love Scotty Barnes. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1805.8799999999999s)]
*  So I don't even have a Scotty Barnes show. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1806.72s)]
*  Apologies to Jay Skeets. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1807.56s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1808.3999999999999s)]
*  So Washington, Brooklyn, Clippers, Toronto, Chicago, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1809.56s)]
*  Portland would be our bottom six. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1812.8s)]
*  The point is the Clippers are in the top three. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1816.32s)]
*  They are. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1818.28s)]
*  But you're going for the other teams again. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1819.12s)]
*  Atlantic could be honorable mention as well. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1819.96s)]
*  And just personally, he might be a nice guy, James Harden. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1822.32s)]
*  Might be a sweetheart of a guy. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1827.12s)]
*  Might be a great friend. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1828.2s)]
*  People love him. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1829.24s)]
*  Good family guy. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1830.08s)]
*  Great ringer contact. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1830.92s)]
*  I'm sure he's a great teammate. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1831.76s)]
*  He has. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1832.72s)]
*  I just don't like watching him play basketball [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1833.56s)]
*  and we've been watching him now for almost two decades [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1835.4s)]
*  and the fact that this offense is now going to revolve [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1838.96s)]
*  around the heliocentric shit. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1841.64s)]
*  Fourth in MVP. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1844.16s)]
*  But he's 35 years old. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1845.0s)]
*  It sounds horrible. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1847.0400000000002s)]
*  I actually am. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1849.2s)]
*  It sounds horrible. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1850.0400000000002s)]
*  I'm excited about it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1850.88s)]
*  He just made a statement where he was like, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1854.6000000000001s)]
*  everybody said I couldn't do it, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1856.72s)]
*  but look what Luca just did. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1858.44s)]
*  Like as if Luca. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1861.0400000000002s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1862.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1863.0800000000002s)]
*  It was like somehow Luca popping him. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1863.92s)]
*  And that meant because Luca made it to the NBA finals, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1866.2s)]
*  Harden was always right. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1868.64s)]
*  It reminded me of when part of my take [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1869.48s)]
*  was bringing in Skip Bayless [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1871.56s)]
*  and Skip complimented himself three times [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1872.52s)]
*  within 45 seconds. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1874.84s)]
*  He thought he was actually complimenting them. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1876.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1878.52s)]
*  But it was like, you guys are the next. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1879.36s)]
*  Well him and Stephen A created that show. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1880.6s)]
*  They created two guys talking to each other. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  It was fucking unheard of. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1884.56s)]
*  Nobody had thought about that before. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1885.56s)]
*  No, it was unbelievable. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  Under and it's a lock for me. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1890.32s)]
*  The Clippers 37 and a half. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1892.9199999999998s)]
*  I think they're going to be awful. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1894.6799999999998s)]
*  What do you have, House? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1896.9199999999998s)]
*  It's an under. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1897.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure whether that's a lock, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1898.76s)]
*  but it's an easy under. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1900.0s)]
*  Under, under, under. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1901.52s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1903.6s)]
*  Under. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1904.44s)]
*  There's no way I'm touching that over. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1905.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1906.12s)]
*  That's a healthy number. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1906.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1908.8s)]
*  Like, I mean, I understand that Vegas has already [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1909.64s)]
*  baked in all the different variables here, but. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1910.96s)]
*  There's a funny Tai Lu thing too, where people go, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1914.52s)]
*  well, Tai Lu, I mean, he's an amazing coach. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1917.48s)]
*  Tai Lu is 312 and 217 as a coach. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1919.64s)]
*  His coach way less than people remember. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1922.96s)]
*  He went 0 and 6 for the 2019 Cavs and got fired. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1925.44s)]
*  The 22 team went 42 and 40. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1929.36s)]
*  Like if you don't have the roster, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1931.6s)]
*  you don't have the roster. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1932.9599999999998s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1933.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's no. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  You can't be like, oh, Tai Lu will make them good. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1935.4799999999998s)]
*  It's like, all right, if he makes them good, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1937.12s)]
*  they'll be 41 and 41. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1938.4799999999998s)]
*  Put Millsy on the blue line. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1940.36s)]
*  So we're going under for all of those. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1944.6799999999998s)]
*  So I had for my playoff teams, OKC Phoenix, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1946.0s)]
*  Minnesota, Dallas, Denver, and Memphis slash Sacramento [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1949.28s)]
*  is the top six, just for the record. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1953.56s)]
*  So we're going to move to the East. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1955.32s)]
*  We were just congratulating ourselves [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1957.32s)]
*  during the break for not having [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1958.88s)]
*  the Brian and James conversation. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1960.0s)]
*  I've never been prouder of the three of us. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1961.2800000000002s)]
*  The Milwaukee Bucks are our first team in the Central. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1963.5200000000002s)]
*  They're over under 50 and a half. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1966.96s)]
*  They are minus 105 for the division. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1968.72s)]
*  Speaking of nepotism. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1970.48s)]
*  They are 18 and one best record. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1972.0800000000002s)]
*  Plus a 50 for the one seed. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1977.0800000000002s)]
*  And what they did this off season house, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1978.8400000000001s)]
*  they added seven, eight, nine guys. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1981.16s)]
*  They added Prince and Wright and Trent, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1984.24s)]
*  who I think is actually going to start for them. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1988.12s)]
*  They're a little deeper. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1989.6s)]
*  My take is they're too old, but I'll let you, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1992.8s)]
*  I'll give you the four and then I'll weigh in after. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1995.0s)]
*  What's your take on the Bucks? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1997.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's an under for me. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=1998.32s)]
*  I think they are just running it back. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2001.08s)]
*  Gary Trent's already hurt. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2003.32s)]
*  Middleton is hurt. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2004.4799999999998s)]
*  We're in the Middleton win. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2007.32s)]
*  Is he due back? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2009.4799999999998s)]
*  How effective is he going to be? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2010.9599999999998s)]
*  Conversation already. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2012.9599999999998s)]
*  And you know, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2014.76s)]
*  Dame, it all really boils down to Dame. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2018.4s)]
*  And he was kind of there for every other game. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2022.08s)]
*  He's every other game Dame. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2024.36s)]
*  At the point of his career. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2025.92s)]
*  We talked about this on the pod last year, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2027.36s)]
*  when you become like a once a week, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2029.12s)]
*  I'm really good guy in the NBA. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2030.72s)]
*  And they usually happen to do mid 30s. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2032.48s)]
*  You're not talking total games, you're talking output. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2033.32s)]
*  No, I'm just saying. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2035.72s)]
*  Because you played 70s. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2036.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, I'm saying once a week, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2037.4s)]
*  he puts up 36 and he looks really good. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2039.0s)]
*  And then there's that other game [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2042.0s)]
*  when he's like six for 19. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2043.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2045.32s)]
*  Yeah, he was in a better spot. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2046.32s)]
*  Cause you could just put up a million shots [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2047.6s)]
*  and never had any expectation. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2049.44s)]
*  And I mean, it's cool that he wanted to go somewhere else, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2051.32s)]
*  but Portland, it was actually safer for him [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2053.44s)]
*  as opposed to some of the limitations. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2056.2s)]
*  Like there's still, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2058.6s)]
*  when you talk about just pure shot making, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2059.44s)]
*  he's on a very short list of guys, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2061.88s)]
*  even at this age in the NBA, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2063.6s)]
*  where I think you feel like that firepower [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2065.4s)]
*  is what you want in the playoffs. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2067.16s)]
*  But the age on this man is starting to get scary. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2068.4s)]
*  And a lot of these draft picks, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2071.6s)]
*  it's not like they were drafting super high, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2072.84s)]
*  but I don't know which ones I feel good about. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2074.48s)]
*  Lopez, 36, season 17. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2077.1200000000003s)]
*  Middleton, 33, season 13. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2080.2000000000003s)]
*  Dame, 34, season 13. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  Giannis, 30, season 12. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2084.84s)]
*  Portis, 30, season 10. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2087.32s)]
*  Wright is 32, season 10. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2089.8s)]
*  And Coniton's 31, season 10. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2091.56s)]
*  I was trying to think of other old teams that did well. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2093.4s)]
*  And my mind drifted back to that Celtics run in 2012. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2096.92s)]
*  Basically that 2010 to 2012 wrench, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2102.88s)]
*  where the team got old. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2106.36s)]
*  Pierce was at the tail end of being peak Pierce, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2108.04s)]
*  but Garnett had the knee surgery, wasn't the same. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2111.7200000000003s)]
*  Ray Allen was moving to a different point in his career. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2114.16s)]
*  And it was just hard for them to get it done [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2116.0s)]
*  during the regular season. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2118.32s)]
*  It was that one year, they were like 25 and 25. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2119.7200000000003s)]
*  Then they were able to flip the switch in the playoffs. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2122.44s)]
*  2010, they made the finals. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2124.96s)]
*  2012, they came close to making the finals. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2126.4s)]
*  Feels like that's more of a buck season to me, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2129.48s)]
*  but I think the league sees it. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2132.56s)]
*  They left Giannis off on Christmas. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2133.64s)]
*  I think because they didn't think [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2137.64s)]
*  they were one of the best 12 teams in the league. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2139.0s)]
*  That seems ridiculous though, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2142.9199999999996s)]
*  because Giannis is the main, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2144.2s)]
*  I felt like even in the end of last year [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2146.3599999999997s)]
*  and going into the playoffs, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2149.7599999999998s)]
*  he gets hurt at the very end. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2151.3199999999997s)]
*  He misses the entire playoffs. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2153.0s)]
*  Lillard's hurt, he only plays four of this. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2154.3199999999997s)]
*  You were thinking MVP for him at one point. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2155.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I still think I voted him second. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2158.64s)]
*  Did I vote him second? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2162.36s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2163.2s)]
*  But they were 49 and 33 last year [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2164.64s)]
*  and he played the whole season. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2166.6s)]
*  Right, I don't want to be disrespectful of him, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2167.92s)]
*  but when I went through and looked at all of this stuff, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  I think of the top 10 guys in their two deep, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2171.64s)]
*  there's only one guy in his 20s. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2175.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2177.68s)]
*  So, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2179.0s)]
*  I was thinking about, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2182.44s)]
*  if I'm building a team that I want to at least succeed [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2184.24s)]
*  during the regular season, forget the playoffs. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2186.6s)]
*  I want to be able to guard point guards [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2189.04s)]
*  and I want to be able to guard swings, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2191.0s)]
*  like the Tatum types. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2192.56s)]
*  This team can't really do either [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2194.32s)]
*  because the middle 10 has not been the same [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2196.48s)]
*  since that finals run. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2198.24s)]
*  And it just seems like his knees are, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2199.4s)]
*  he's at a different point in his career. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2201.72s)]
*  Now, he's been a minus or a zero on defense [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2203.88s)]
*  really for two years now. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2206.76s)]
*  The last four seasons, his turnover rate is up, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2207.6s)]
*  his free throw rate is down. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2209.4s)]
*  So, when you're looking for aging numbers, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2210.36s)]
*  even if he can get it going, like on a certain night, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2213.32s)]
*  but there'll be numbers going, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2216.2s)]
*  okay, he's not grabbing as many rebounds, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2217.4s)]
*  he's not turning all, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2219.24s)]
*  he's not getting to the free throw line as much. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2220.2s)]
*  It's not the same guy. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2222.12s)]
*  Just stuff you would expect an older player to be like, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2222.96s)]
*  I don't want to do all of these things. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2224.64s)]
*  But defensively, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2225.8399999999997s)]
*  the way they match up against Boston on the wings, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2227.56s)]
*  that's why when we start talking about the rest [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2230.56s)]
*  of the East and Boston, there's some teams where I go, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2232.2s)]
*  I don't think you have an answer for what Boston has [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2234.8399999999997s)]
*  where there's one team in particular where like, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2236.7999999999997s)]
*  at least I can understand your approach [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2238.48s)]
*  and who you would throw at some of these dudes. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2240.4399999999996s)]
*  So, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2241.72s)]
*  he's played 88 games the last two years too, come on. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2243.7599999999998s)]
*  Damn D minus defender, F plus, F or an F minus. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2246.52s)]
*  What would you go with? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2250.04s)]
*  You want to know why I had so bad [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2250.88s)]
*  is because when the sideline person starts talking [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2252.16s)]
*  about the person's bad defensive reputation [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2255.72s)]
*  and why he's actually a lot better than people realize, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2258.28s)]
*  that's immediately enough. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2261.08s)]
*  I always enjoy that. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2261.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2262.76s)]
*  He tries harder at that end than he gets credit for. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2263.6s)]
*  No, Doc says a lot of people think that Luke Cornett's quicker. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2266.16s)]
*  So, what if this goes badly, House? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2270.92s)]
*  What if they're 24 and 26 after 50 games? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2276.2799999999997s)]
*  What does Giannis, I'm just. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2283.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2285.7999999999997s)]
*  You're trying to speak into existence. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2286.64s)]
*  I'm not trying to speak anything into existence. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2289.08s)]
*  I just think that guy's crazy competitive. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2291.24s)]
*  He's been super loyal along the way. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2293.4s)]
*  He has. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2295.72s)]
*  He has drawn a lot of people into existence. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2296.56s)]
*  Along the way. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2298.88s)]
*  He has. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2299.6800000000003s)]
*  He has tried to drag the organization along. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2300.52s)]
*  I think he cares about titles, man. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2302.88s)]
*  I don't think he wants to be on a shit team [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2304.52s)]
*  that can't guard anybody. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2306.36s)]
*  Well, he's on one. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2307.6000000000004s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2308.92s)]
*  That's what he's on right now. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2309.76s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2310.76s)]
*  So, the best case scenario would be the 2011 maps. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2312.44s)]
*  Most important ring in the last 10 years? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2314.88s)]
*  Giannis? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2317.8s)]
*  As far as the conversation around the person [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2320.1600000000003s)]
*  being fair or unfair, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2322.32s)]
*  imagine how different the conversation around Giannis. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2323.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I guess LeBron won again in 2020. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2326.0s)]
*  I was gonna say that 2016 helped out LeBron and Kyrie. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2328.0s)]
*  The combo. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2332.28s)]
*  Kyrie's career is completely different [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2333.64s)]
*  if they don't win game seven, right? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2335.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2338.04s)]
*  We're not even... [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2338.88s)]
*  I think that game seven result almost is misleading. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2340.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2343.4s)]
*  For him, not LeBron. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2344.76s)]
*  I don't know where Giannis could go though [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2346.2s)]
*  when we talk about, well, he's gonna ask out. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2347.6s)]
*  All right, pick a team. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2349.36s)]
*  Brooklyn is gonna go to Miami. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2350.84s)]
*  You're really the only one talking about him asking out. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2351.68s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna ask out. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2353.2s)]
*  I think he's a top four player in the league [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2354.6s)]
*  and I think his situation is really bad. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2356.2400000000002s)]
*  If it falls apart, I think it's gonna be, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2357.24s)]
*  the old line that I've used all the time is like, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2359.68s)]
*  it's usually not the international guys [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2361.64s)]
*  because it's not, it's the American guys that ask out. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2364.64s)]
*  I mean, eventually there's gonna be the international guys. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2367.7599999999998s)]
*  It almost fell apart last year, just FYI. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2369.3199999999997s)]
*  Like there was... [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2371.12s)]
*  But Finozes is not on the team. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2371.96s)]
*  Well, he got hurt though. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2374.44s)]
*  Him and Gigi Jackson, they ran into each other. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2376.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but he's not on, he's a free agent. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2379.04s)]
*  Oh, he's literally not on the team. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2381.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, let me double check it, but I'm pretty sure he's not. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2382.36s)]
*  It did almost fall apart last year. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2384.3199999999997s)]
*  They fired the coach. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2385.84s)]
*  So if Miami just signed Thanasis. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2387.92s)]
*  I'm telling you, everybody needs to be on Thanasis alert. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2390.04s)]
*  Watch. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2393.16s)]
*  Thanasis alert. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2394.0s)]
*  Let's cut that into a social. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2395.0s)]
*  Make sure he's not on Miami. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2396.68s)]
*  Did Miami sign him? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2398.52s)]
*  That would be the most Miami thing ever, wouldn't it? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2400.08s)]
*  Well, dude, the Lakers had the other one, like, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2402.64s)]
*  and then as soon as I think Giannis signed his extension, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2406.68s)]
*  they're like, cut him. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2409.12s)]
*  So you're under Rosillo? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2410.96s)]
*  I'm under. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2412.76s)]
*  House is under? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2413.72s)]
*  I want to still like, stay respectful of Giannis. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2415.12s)]
*  Me too. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2417.68s)]
*  By the way, we all went under on, or I went over on Jokic, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2418.96s)]
*  but on Denver, you went under. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2421.8399999999997s)]
*  It's the same situation. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2424.4s)]
*  I like Denver's team a lot more than Milwaukee's team. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  I do not. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2427.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2429.52s)]
*  You like Milwaukee's one through nine better than Denver's. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2430.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be able to guard anybody [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2432.92s)]
*  who can get to the basket. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2435.04s)]
*  Giannis is going to have to guard everybody [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2436.56s)]
*  in the other team at all times. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2438.24s)]
*  And by the way, Lopez might just hit a different point [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2440.2799999999997s)]
*  in his career one of these years, right? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2442.56s)]
*  He's been in the league forever. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2444.12s)]
*  Could be this year. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2445.24s)]
*  Could be this year. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2446.08s)]
*  He's on the trade block. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2446.92s)]
*  Here's a team I'm guessing that all of us, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2448.4s)]
*  like the Cleveland Cavaliers, they're over under 48 and a half. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2450.24s)]
*  I think there's been some action on that. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2453.96s)]
*  I want to say that was a little lower. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2455.4s)]
*  They're plus 240 for the division, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2457.2799999999997s)]
*  which I would encourage as a bet for people out there. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2459.0s)]
*  They're 11 to one for a one seed, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2462.04s)]
*  which is an interesting hedge against the Celtics. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2463.8399999999997s)]
*  If you think weird Celtic shit's going to happen. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2466.88s)]
*  New coach Kenny Atkinson. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2468.56s)]
*  And more importantly, they brought everyone back. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2470.4s)]
*  New coach, healthy Garland. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2473.96s)]
*  Mitchell settled. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2477.3599999999997s)]
*  That situation settled. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2478.3599999999997s)]
*  They took care of Mobley. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2479.64s)]
*  Why isn't this a 50 plus win team house? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2482.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2485.04s)]
*  I think people are sleeping on- [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2486.16s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2487.0s)]
*  How is this team that goes 52 and 30? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2487.8399999999997s)]
*  The aspect of this especially [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2489.3999999999996s)]
*  that is going to be eye opening is Kenny Atkinson. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2491.16s)]
*  I think he's going to be incredible with these guys. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2494.96s)]
*  We loved him in Brooklyn and then Durant and Kyrie showed up [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2497.6s)]
*  and neither of them played that year. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2500.64s)]
*  No, they signed there because of the culture. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2502.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2505.0s)]
*  And then they bounced him. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2505.84s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2508.28s)]
*  Joe's eye culture. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2509.48s)]
*  They've done a really good job here with Din Whitty [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2510.44s)]
*  and Angela Russell to help these guys. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2512.2000000000003s)]
*  Like it's a good culture. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2513.96s)]
*  Top ringer 100. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2515.5600000000004s)]
*  I had Mitchell 13 and then I had the Garland, Mobley, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2517.44s)]
*  Jared Allen, 45, 47, 51. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2522.76s)]
*  So four top 51. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2525.5600000000004s)]
*  Four top 51. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2526.6400000000003s)]
*  That speaks to the 50 plus win thing. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2528.28s)]
*  They signed Allen to a really good contract extension [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2532.92s)]
*  that if Mobley, if it's starting to look like [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2535.28s)]
*  maybe he could play center, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2537.7200000000003s)]
*  Allen becomes a really fun trade piece for them. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2540.32s)]
*  But I don't think they're going to do it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2542.68s)]
*  To me, this is a conference winner. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2545.0s)]
*  I'm not a conference winner, a division winner. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2547.04s)]
*  I like the plus 240. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2549.0s)]
*  I love the over. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2550.2s)]
*  It's a lock for me, Rossello. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2551.04s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2552.2s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2553.76s)]
*  Totally aligned on this. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2554.92s)]
*  I just think when you look at all of those guys together, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2557.12s)]
*  I would expect it to go over. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2561.0s)]
*  Their offense is okay. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2564.2000000000003s)]
*  Their defense has been terrific now [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2565.6400000000003s)]
*  for two seasons statistically. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2567.1200000000003s)]
*  They shoot it okay enough. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2569.96s)]
*  Remember they went 17 and won last year. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2571.56s)]
*  Garland missed 25 games. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2575.08s)]
*  I think the injuries were kind of flukey with him. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2576.76s)]
*  And whatever you want to say about the Mitchell overlap [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2579.52s)]
*  thing, when they get to the playoffs with those four guys, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2581.96s)]
*  I'm no longer into it anymore. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2584.1200000000003s)]
*  The spacing isn't good enough. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2585.4s)]
*  The Mobley Allen thing is redundant. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2586.6000000000004s)]
*  But that's not what we're talking about. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2588.84s)]
*  Just Mitchell has these stretches during the season [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2591.32s)]
*  where he looks absolutely unstoppable, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2594.28s)]
*  which is even with his imperfections, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2597.08s)]
*  why so many teams would have gladly taken him. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2599.1200000000003s)]
*  They end up re-signing basically all these guys. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2601.6400000000003s)]
*  So all the speculators, it should just be a happier team. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2603.96s)]
*  I think there was doubt with Bickerstaff too [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2607.1200000000003s)]
*  that led into some of the problems they were having. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2609.44s)]
*  So I'd expect them to be a 50-win team in the East, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2611.6400000000003s)]
*  but the playoff thing is a completely different conversation. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2615.36s)]
*  Totally agree. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2617.36s)]
*  Totally agree. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2618.24s)]
*  And the math is kind of crazy. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2619.16s)]
*  All of their most important guys missed around 20 games [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2621.8799999999997s)]
*  last season. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2624.8399999999997s)]
*  Every one of them, the four most important guys. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2625.68s)]
*  So we were talking. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2628.24s)]
*  And they won 48. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2629.68s)]
*  So I think my three favorite overs are OKC, Phoenix, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2632.08s)]
*  and Cleveland, just the three I feel the best about. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2636.04s)]
*  And we've hit the super boost. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2639.16s)]
*  We've hit three years in a row, I think, for FanDuel. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2641.3599999999997s)]
*  Super boost. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2643.64s)]
*  So there's an easier one that's OKC 55-plus wins, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2644.68s)]
*  Phoenix 45-plus, and Cleveland 45-plus. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2649.16s)]
*  And that's like a little under two to one. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2654.52s)]
*  That would be the safe one. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2656.68s)]
*  There's one where we could do OKC 60-plus, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2658.64s)]
*  Phoenix 45-plus, Cleveland 45-plus. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2661.64s)]
*  That's a little over four to one. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2664.3599999999997s)]
*  There's a Mac Daddy one, OKC 60-plus, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2667.08s)]
*  Phoenix 50-plus, Cleveland 45-plus, plus 713. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2669.72s)]
*  Or you could throw Cleveland 50-plus [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2675.52s)]
*  and go get it to like 10 to one. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2677.24s)]
*  But I'm, we haven't decided yet. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2679.96s)]
*  I like the way, I would take the OKC 60 [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2682.72s)]
*  and pull it down just because 60 is such rarefied air, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2685.44s)]
*  even though I believe in, I mean not Cleveland. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2688.04s)]
*  So we could do the OKC 55, Phoenix 45, Cleveland 45, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2690.0s)]
*  around two to one and get them to boost it. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2694.0s)]
*  I would be okay with OKC 55, Cleveland 50, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2695.72s)]
*  Phoenix 50, that's the way I would do it. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2700.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2703.16s)]
*  I'd like both those teams at 50 wins a share. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2704.04s)]
*  Well, if I like all three of them, you know, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2705.48s)]
*  you can't, what was Phoenix, 49 and a half in our exercise? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2709.0s)]
*  No, it was 47 and a half. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2713.68s)]
*  It was 47 and a half? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2715.84s)]
*  So you gotta get north of 50? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2716.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2717.8s)]
*  Just at 50, right? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2718.64s)]
*  50, 50 caches. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2719.6s)]
*  You can get super conservative and do, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2721.04s)]
*  anyway, they have, Fandl has a bunch of NBA futures, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2723.24s)]
*  profit boost token they can do. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2726.76s)]
*  We're gonna do a page, we're gonna do a super boost. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2728.36s)]
*  So keep an eye on all that stuff [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2730.92s)]
*  because they are going to have a Bill Simmons, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2732.28s)]
*  NBA futures profit boost tied to this podcast, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2736.48s)]
*  going live Friday, October 18th. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2739.36s)]
*  Three futures that will be eligible for the boost. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2743.52s)]
*  So we'll figure that out. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2746.1600000000003s)]
*  But it's gonna be, I think those are the three teams, right? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2747.0s)]
*  OKC, Cleveland, Phoenix, we like those three [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2749.92s)]
*  or is there another one you would get excited about? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2752.48s)]
*  No, cause I think the payout on it. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2754.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2757.6800000000003s)]
*  Right, I mean, look, Phoenix, even if we can all sit here [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2758.52s)]
*  and say, hey, it's gonna be over, it's gonna be better, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2761.2s)]
*  they're gonna understand, they're gonna point guard [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2762.68s)]
*  a new coach and all these different things, like, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2764.04s)]
*  they get hurt all the time. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2766.9199999999996s)]
*  Right, so 45 is safer than 50. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2768.12s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2770.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2771.04s)]
*  Investor conference? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2772.8399999999997s)]
*  It's an investor relations call. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2774.08s)]
*  It's a double call. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2776.8799999999997s)]
*  How about, I'm so confused. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2779.52s)]
*  Two names? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2781.04s)]
*  It's two stocks. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2782.24s)]
*  Darius Garland stock. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2783.9199999999996s)]
*  Where are we sitting, Broker's job last year? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2786.72s)]
*  I made so much on it early. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2787.56s)]
*  You sold? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2789.56s)]
*  It was just ridiculous, the prophet was staring at me [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2791.88s)]
*  and like, like. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2793.48s)]
*  So you jumped out? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2794.48s)]
*  No, I didn't get out, but I took some profits. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2795.56s)]
*  Took some off the table. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2797.6s)]
*  Took some off. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2798.44s)]
*  Took some off the table, it's fine, smart. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2799.2799999999997s)]
*  If you think it's at a high, you take a little off. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2801.8s)]
*  You thought he stunk. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2804.16s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2806.32s)]
*  You did. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2807.36s)]
*  Broker's jaw last year. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2808.2s)]
*  No, in the beginning. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2809.04s)]
*  I thought he was a mess. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2809.88s)]
*  Beginning. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2810.72s)]
*  I thought he seemed small. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2811.56s)]
*  I got talked into it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2812.4s)]
*  He does disappear sometimes. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2816.24s)]
*  I'd like to recommend. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2817.24s)]
*  It's fine, I'm not telling you he's, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2818.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm saying Thomas. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2821.8s)]
*  Can I make a recommendation on the call? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2822.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2823.48s)]
*  I'd like to go back in and buy a little more. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2824.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2825.6800000000003s)]
*  Like when Spotify was down to like 75, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2826.52s)]
*  it's like, yeah, when Netflix dropped to 250, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2829.8s)]
*  I'd like to go back in and buy more Garland. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2833.16s)]
*  I think he had a fucked up year last year. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2835.6s)]
*  You've broken jaw and then you have to play basketball. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2837.16s)]
*  These dips aren't gonna buy themselves, Bill. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2839.52s)]
*  All right, let's go to Evan Mobley. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2843.2000000000003s)]
*  How are we feeling? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2845.2000000000003s)]
*  You got a giant contract. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2846.04s)]
*  I loved him when Alan wasn't playing. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2847.12s)]
*  So is that the answer? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2849.44s)]
*  That's the reason to buy more stock [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2850.96s)]
*  because ultimately Jared Allen's probably not gonna be [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2852.4s)]
*  on this team and Evan Mobley will be the. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2855.28s)]
*  They're a fucked up team that I like. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2857.2400000000002s)]
*  That's one reason, but what if Mobley [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2859.88s)]
*  and Alan can play together? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2862.36s)]
*  What if Kenny Atkinson encourages, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2864.44s)]
*  what if Evan Mobley has been putting up 1,000 threes [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2866.68s)]
*  a morning, every morning. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2870.2400000000002s)]
*  We'll know in the first week [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2872.08s)]
*  if he's looking super comfortable. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2873.16s)]
*  Go ahead, guys. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2874.76s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2875.76s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2876.7200000000003s)]
*  Like Mobley's all of a sudden just gonna be [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2877.88s)]
*  draining threes. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2879.56s)]
*  23 years old. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2880.88s)]
*  There needed to be some real tangible improvement [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2882.56s)]
*  on the ball skills with him. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2887.88s)]
*  To round him out and being like the player [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2889.7599999999998s)]
*  we could hope that he would be, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2891.92s)]
*  it feels like those, that's not happening. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2894.12s)]
*  But I still liked what I saw in the Boston series [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2897.28s)]
*  when Alan wasn't out there. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2899.8s)]
*  So you sold your stock? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2901.08s)]
*  Hi, I don't have the same price target on it [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2903.72s)]
*  that we did three years ago. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2905.6s)]
*  My price target was too high. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2908.04s)]
*  Those guys are incredible. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2910.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a tiny bit low. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2911.08s)]
*  After the stock goes down 30%, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2911.92s)]
*  it'd be like, you know, us over here, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2913.32s)]
*  it's so and so investments [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2914.64s)]
*  that we've changed our price target. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2916.08s)]
*  Like after you lost me 30% of my position. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2918.08s)]
*  Are you locking down Cleveland over? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2921.6s)]
*  Yes, it's a lock. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2923.7200000000003s)]
*  48 and a half, it's a lock. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2925.36s)]
*  I have it as a lock as well. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2926.2000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, not even close. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2927.1600000000003s)]
*  No hesitation or reservation. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2928.92s)]
*  Priscilla? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2931.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2932.12s)]
*  I don't think you've locked anything yet. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2932.96s)]
*  I'm waiting on the lock. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2933.96s)]
*  We'll do it at the end of that. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2934.8s)]
*  End of part three, we'll do it. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2935.64s)]
*  I'm gonna see where I'm at. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2936.7200000000003s)]
*  Next team, Indiana Pacers. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2938.2s)]
*  47 and a half is the number. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2941.08s)]
*  They won 47 games last year. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2942.7599999999998s)]
*  They made the conference finals. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2944.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't they be better? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2945.92s)]
*  Basically brought back the same team, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2948.08s)]
*  including Siakam. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2950.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's not the same team. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2951.8399999999997s)]
*  There for the full year, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2953.3599999999997s)]
*  but the same team we saw in the playoffs. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2954.2s)]
*  Here's my question, Rassilo. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2956.7999999999997s)]
*  Are we sure this isn't the everything went great [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2959.12s)]
*  for this team last year team? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2963.0s)]
*  Everything went awesome. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2965.24s)]
*  We're not sure. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2966.08s)]
*  The Atlanta Hawks, basically. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2967.08s)]
*  The fluky conference finals run that we had from Dallas. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2968.76s)]
*  Took some people by surprise for six weeks. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2971.76s)]
*  Atlanta's the best example of it, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2974.28s)]
*  because Atlanta talked themselves into thinking [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2976.4s)]
*  that they were in that neighborhood. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2978.08s)]
*  Portland had one of those against Golden State, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2978.92s)]
*  where they got destroyed by them. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2981.16s)]
*  Dallas in 22, maybe with Golden State a little bit, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2982.84s)]
*  because it's not the same team, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2986.64s)]
*  but as far as having Luca. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2987.92s)]
*  So that one's not as fluky as those other two. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2989.76s)]
*  I understand your point. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2991.64s)]
*  The Knicks at the end of it, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2993.36s)]
*  who's left? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2995.96s)]
*  They beat Milwaukee without Giannis. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2996.88s)]
*  They beat the falling apart Knicks. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=2998.64s)]
*  Got swept by the Celtics, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3000.4s)]
*  but the games were a little closer than a sweep. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3001.56s)]
*  It was a gentlemen's sweep. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3003.7200000000003s)]
*  The first game, they gave game one away. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3004.56s)]
*  They actively, it's the single thing that I hold [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3006.56s)]
*  against Halliburton more than anything else. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3009.28s)]
*  They blew two of those games, like epic fashion. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3011.8s)]
*  Epic. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3014.6s)]
*  41 games of Siakam, though. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3016.8s)]
*  Only 41 games. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3018.52s)]
*  I thought this was the single hardest over-under. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3022.32s)]
*  Oh, I'm so surprised. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3025.44s)]
*  I changed my mind on it a hundred times. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3026.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like the tiniest of tiny unders. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3030.6s)]
*  I think they go 47 and 35. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3032.7200000000003s)]
*  I couldn't get into the 48, 49, 50 range, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3036.08s)]
*  because I just think a lot of things [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3039.4s)]
*  went right for them last year. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3041.32s)]
*  So here's why I would distinguish this team [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3042.6s)]
*  from some of those other teams that went on playoff runs, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3045.6800000000003s)]
*  and then we didn't really see them [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3048.36s)]
*  being able to hold it up. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3050.08s)]
*  Nemhard was a effing revelation in the playoffs, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3052.04s)]
*  and I don't think he's a flash in the pan. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3056.04s)]
*  I think that's sustainable. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3057.72s)]
*  I think that dude can be counted on. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3059.3199999999997s)]
*  When you see that level of execution, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3062.48s)]
*  that efficiency offensively, that's not an accident. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3065.08s)]
*  And then Matheran didn't play. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3070.2799999999997s)]
*  Matheran wasn't part of that team that went on that run, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3072.04s)]
*  and I think he's good. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3074.9199999999996s)]
*  So I think they're deep. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3076.3999999999996s)]
*  The thing they have to do is play some goddamn defense, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3078.04s)]
*  and it's on Rick Carlisle in this off-season [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3081.0s)]
*  how they're going to play, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3084.08s)]
*  and Siakam should help with that, should. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3085.48s)]
*  All they need to be is middle of the road defensively. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3088.7599999999998s)]
*  They need to not be bottom five defensively. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3091.8s)]
*  They can still play at the pace they play at, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3094.16s)]
*  and that pace is effing badass. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3096.12s)]
*  They asked Boston, who do you fear in these playoffs? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3100.2s)]
*  They're like Indiana, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3102.84s)]
*  because they play such a unique style. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3104.16s)]
*  They're a super hard matchup. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3107.32s)]
*  I'm on the over for this team. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3109.04s)]
*  I can't really fight any of that. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3111.68s)]
*  What do you have for Siakam? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3113.52s)]
*  I had the under, because McDermott's no longer signed. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3114.72s)]
*  What? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3118.6s)]
*  And I went back to the over [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3119.44s)]
*  because they got old friend James Wiseman. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3121.0s)]
*  There he is. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3123.0s)]
*  On that same rotation. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3123.84s)]
*  There he is. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3124.68s)]
*  So that's an over for me. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3125.52s)]
*  There he is. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3126.36s)]
*  He's only 24. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3127.4s)]
*  He's just scratching the surface. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3130.0s)]
*  It's like when Darko ended up on Memphis. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3132.64s)]
*  Orlando? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3134.8s)]
*  Oh, Memphis. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3135.64s)]
*  You're like, ah, Memphis is tapping into something here. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3136.48s)]
*  Orlando gave up a lottery pick for him. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3139.72s)]
*  I don't feel. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3142.04s)]
*  I think that was a Rodney Stuckey pick. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3142.88s)]
*  I don't. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3145.44s)]
*  Double check. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3146.28s)]
*  I just thought this was super hard. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3147.2000000000003s)]
*  So I'm against you guys in this one. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3148.92s)]
*  One thing on Halliburton, glad House brought them up. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3152.12s)]
*  I was thinking they don't do the OMBA the same way [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3155.08s)]
*  where we don't have to pick two guards, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3157.2400000000002s)]
*  even though I still do it, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3158.7200000000003s)]
*  because I like to stay a little traditional. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3159.7200000000003s)]
*  But I was thinking about how hard the OMBA crop [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3163.12s)]
*  is gonna be this year, just on paper. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3165.96s)]
*  Because Luca counts as a guard, SGA, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3168.4s)]
*  Jalen Brunson, Curry, Edwards, Mitchell, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3171.2799999999997s)]
*  Booker, Fox, Halliburton, John Morant. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3175.2s)]
*  And then you even go into this Kyrie, Jamal Murray, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3179.3199999999997s)]
*  Tyrese Maxey, Harden, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3181.7599999999998s)]
*  Damien Lillard, Mikhail Bridges group. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3183.68s)]
*  It might be the deepest list of A-list guards that we've had. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3186.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, I can't believe, I'm looking at this list. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3193.52s)]
*  I had Halliburton as my ninth best guard [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3195.3599999999997s)]
*  heading into the season. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3197.2799999999997s)]
*  Halliburton was really good last year. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3198.7599999999998s)]
*  Remember how good he was before the All-Star break, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3201.6s)]
*  which I also think is part of the conversation [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3203.48s)]
*  on the over that we're having now [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3205.64s)]
*  that I think is worth at least bringing up. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3207.32s)]
*  43 games pre-All-Star, 22-4-12, 49-40 shooting splits. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3209.2s)]
*  His sister just out of control at that point. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3214.28s)]
*  Eight threes a game. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3218.04s)]
*  And then he's got the groin thing, he was missing time, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3219.4s)]
*  we didn't know when he was coming back. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3222.4s)]
*  And the shooting went from 40 to 30% from three, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3223.6s)]
*  the assist went down, the points went down. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3226.08s)]
*  You know what, fuck it, I'm changing. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3227.96s)]
*  There was gonna be less shots [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3229.08s)]
*  and I'm gonna see Ockham, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3229.92s)]
*  but I love that House brought up the Matheran part too, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3231.0s)]
*  because like, look, maybe Matheran's not a long-term [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3233.36s)]
*  two guard, small four, where you just pencil him in for 20, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3236.48s)]
*  but when that guy comes in, second unit, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3239.2000000000003s)]
*  and he's just attack, attack, attack, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3241.88s)]
*  and I think they still wanna see if they have something [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3244.04s)]
*  to walk or the lottery pick from Houston, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3245.64s)]
*  maybe that's why McDermott's not on the roster anymore. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3247.2400000000002s)]
*  And in the GM survey too, they were like, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3249.6800000000003s)]
*  who runs the best offensive system? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3251.36s)]
*  And it was overwhelming, it was Rick Harlow. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3254.2000000000003s)]
*  I changed my mind, over. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3256.44s)]
*  TJ McConnell's on this team. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3258.08s)]
*  Nemhart turned into. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3259.6s)]
*  They're good, sometimes it scares me about it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3260.6s)]
*  It feels like they're trying to, why is it so low? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3263.24s)]
*  Halliburton at the Olympics was incredible. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3266.96s)]
*  And all of his like, Caitlin Clark stuff, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3270.72s)]
*  Halliburton and his girlfriend are friends with Caitlin [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3273.56s)]
*  and her boyfriend, they got their whole thing. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3276.52s)]
*  I just like, I think he's a good like. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3278.68s)]
*  I'm going under now, what was that? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3280.36s)]
*  I was like, that was, I wanna make sure Tommy Alter [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3282.0s)]
*  still listen to the pod segue. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3285.2s)]
*  I'm mentioning it because I like the glue concept of it. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3287.76s)]
*  No, he was an awesome teammate. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3291.76s)]
*  You want your leader to be a glue guy. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3294.36s)]
*  Back to over, I didn't understand. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3296.04s)]
*  I'm going. That's all? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3297.32s)]
*  You don't like Caitlin Clark? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3299.04s)]
*  They signed Wasmatt and you were back in. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3300.52s)]
*  All right, I'm changing my pick, I'm going over. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3303.72s)]
*  You guys talk me into it. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3307.2s)]
*  I just wanna be right, I want us all to be right. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3308.52s)]
*  Chicago Bulls. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3310.48s)]
*  Yes, under, I hate this team. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3311.76s)]
*  I mean, I like Giddy, kind of, Lonzo, I'm thrilled. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3317.08s)]
*  He's gonna be playing the first game since January 14th of 22. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3320.04s)]
*  Or is it, wait, is it 21? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3324.56s)]
*  I had him in the depth chart with a question mark [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3326.4s)]
*  next to him because I don't know if he's gonna play, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3328.44s)]
*  but I hope he does. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3331.44s)]
*  Oh, that's right, yeah, it's gonna be almost three years. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3332.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3334.52s)]
*  They re-signed Patrick Williams, I think maybe [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3335.92s)]
*  because they heard. For a lot of money. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3338.44s)]
*  They heard Presti liked him. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3339.28s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3341.52s)]
*  No, I'm just, I couldn't believe that contract. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3342.4s)]
*  I mean, he hasn't really even done anything yet. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3345.04s)]
*  I'm excited, this team. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3347.84s)]
*  I like Bozellas. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3349.36s)]
*  This is a team stuck in something that's not good. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3350.2000000000003s)]
*  A lot of Bozellas, bud. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3354.92s)]
*  House was talking about him yesterday. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3356.84s)]
*  He made me go Google. I did go out of 10 to one, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3358.32s)]
*  rookie of the year. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3359.88s)]
*  House Peterman for rookie of the year. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3360.7200000000003s)]
*  Still have some Dale and Terry shares. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3361.92s)]
*  I just think that Bozellas is gonna get run. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3364.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, when you look at the rookies [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3366.48s)]
*  that are gonna get minutes, with this lineup, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3367.96s)]
*  with this team, with this constitution, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3370.2000000000003s)]
*  I think the kid's gonna get some shine. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3373.56s)]
*  They have a top 10 protected draft pick, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3376.04s)]
*  but here's the thing that makes it hard for the over-under. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3378.7200000000003s)]
*  You can be among the 10 worst teams [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3381.0s)]
*  and still win 30 or 31 games. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3383.84s)]
*  If you look at last season. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3386.4s)]
*  I don't know if that's gonna be the case this year though. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3389.32s)]
*  Also, when you're top 10, you can't really fuck around. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3393.28s)]
*  You really have to get in the bottom eight. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3396.92s)]
*  I guess, okay. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3398.56s)]
*  The bottom eight is like 28 down. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3399.4s)]
*  Is it worth it? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3401.56s)]
*  Because I did the five worst win totals [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3402.4s)]
*  of the last five years. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3405.08s)]
*  And it's higher than you think it is. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3406.48s)]
*  For what, the eight spot? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3408.28s)]
*  No, the five worst win totals. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3409.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3413.28s)]
*  So we had the least amount of wins. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3414.12s)]
*  So last year it was 14, 15, 21, 21, 22. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3414.94s)]
*  Two years ago, 17, 22, 22, 27, 33. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3418.92s)]
*  33 wins was the fifth lowest. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3422.52s)]
*  Fifth, yeah. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3423.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3424.76s)]
*  Okay, I think it's important to do these [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3425.6s)]
*  just as we start getting some of these. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3427.2000000000003s)]
*  I agree. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3428.44s)]
*  Three years ago, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3429.8s)]
*  Four years ago, 17, 20, 21, 22, 22. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3433.28s)]
*  And then it was a disaster five years ago. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3437.0800000000004s)]
*  15, 19, 19, 20, 20. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3438.7200000000003s)]
*  Some of that has to do with how top heavy the league is though. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3440.92s)]
*  And it feels like the league is top heavier [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3443.32s)]
*  this year than usual. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3445.1600000000003s)]
*  When we've done this now for years at least with me, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3446.0400000000004s)]
*  being invited into it, which I appreciate, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3448.92s)]
*  I've had like overwhelming theories [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3451.6400000000003s)]
*  on how to handle the bad teams. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3453.96s)]
*  And you go, okay, well, the Cooper flag is the prize. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3455.88s)]
*  And it's gonna get really weird here at the end. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3458.62s)]
*  But I thought that was gonna be the same thing [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3460.66s)]
*  with Wemba Nyama and it still felt like it took too long. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3462.86s)]
*  Tanking doesn't feel as extreme today as it was years ago. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3466.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's probably partly due with the playing game [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3471.7799999999997s)]
*  and flattening the odds a little bit on the lottery. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3474.2999999999997s)]
*  39 and 43 last year and House made the key point. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3478.22s)]
*  Top 10 protected pick owed to the Spurs. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3480.94s)]
*  I'm taking the over because I think that they were, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3483.7s)]
*  are gonna win 28 games. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3486.58s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3488.38s)]
*  That's all. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3489.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, sometimes with the explanation of the overs, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3490.06s)]
*  like what's wrong with you? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3491.38s)]
*  And you're like, no, I still think they're terrible. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3492.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they are terrible. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3493.62s)]
*  So you're going over? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3494.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3495.6600000000003s)]
*  No, I'm going under. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3496.48s)]
*  They've got a million guards. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3497.32s)]
*  I feel like the Levine part of it, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3499.34s)]
*  that boy, I mean, he just. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3502.2200000000003s)]
*  Tough summer for Zach. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3505.1s)]
*  Did he not iron? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3506.26s)]
*  Didn't have the investor relations call for Zach. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3507.2200000000003s)]
*  So this team the last nine years was 3-10 and 4-0-1, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3510.98s)]
*  which is six worst. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3515.14s)]
*  I finally was able to get stat muse to give me that [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3517.18s)]
*  after I searched it nine different ways. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3519.3799999999997s)]
*  Are you sure it's right? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3521.8599999999997s)]
*  It seems right. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3522.7s)]
*  No, you need to check it. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3523.54s)]
*  Seems right. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3524.62s)]
*  But then. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3525.54s)]
*  I swear to God, stat muse is just a huge joke. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3526.3799999999997s)]
*  They're just back there in like a room. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3528.7799999999997s)]
*  Just fucking with us. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3531.02s)]
*  Like a guy just asked for the Celtics home and away record [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3531.94s)]
*  in the sixties. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3535.4199999999996s)]
*  Like tell them that Steve Carlton [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3536.54s)]
*  had 40 complete games in a row. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3539.62s)]
*  That'd be amazing. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3541.8599999999997s)]
*  If it was all of the wrong information. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3544.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't understand where this is going. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3547.98s)]
*  I already did it at the top. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3549.7s)]
*  How many championships have the bulls won? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3550.54s)]
*  18. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3552.02s)]
*  This may not be what you want, but. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3554.5s)]
*  And then they push the subscriber button where it's like, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3557.5s)]
*  for stat muse subscribers get all of this. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3560.5s)]
*  Andres Guajarraga was originally from. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3563.38s)]
*  Like what the fuck is this? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3566.58s)]
*  Anyway, after this year, cause they're going to be bad. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3568.54s)]
*  They're probably going to be the bottom three [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3570.7s)]
*  for the last 10 years. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3572.02s)]
*  But I was looking at the Rheinsdorfs [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3574.18s)]
*  cause this is now year 10 of though. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3577.02s)]
*  We don't really give a shit plan. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3578.5s)]
*  They paid the luxury tax once. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3580.1s)]
*  They haven't won a playoff series since 2015. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3581.98s)]
*  The last dance was probably their highlight of the 2020s. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3585.42s)]
*  Just that showing on TV. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3589.06s)]
*  Good job. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3590.54s)]
*  They have six titles. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3591.9s)]
*  They put those out, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3593.42s)]
*  but their franchise has either quadrupled [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3594.2599999999998s)]
*  or quintupled in value over the last 10 years. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3597.78s)]
*  They might be geniuses. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3600.3s)]
*  Maybe they're playing this perfectly. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3602.06s)]
*  Like why pay the tax if you don't care about the team? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3604.26s)]
*  Your franchise is going up anyway. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3607.26s)]
*  You have the illusion of hope every year with something. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3610.22s)]
*  This year it's like, hey, we got Josh Giddy. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3612.18s)]
*  We got Kobe White. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3613.86s)]
*  This is the family that owns the White Sox. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3615.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3617.98s)]
*  Hello. Good point. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3618.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3619.66s)]
*  They give zero shits. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3620.86s)]
*  Well, Levine is untradable unless the Lakers panic. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3623.42s)]
*  And I thought Rosillo just made a key point. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3626.78s)]
*  It's players that you would like separately, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3629.82s)]
*  but maybe not together. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3631.5s)]
*  Like Kobe White with Giddy, with Levine. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3633.1s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm excited about that. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3635.98s)]
*  There's just so many guards. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3637.98s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3638.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of- [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3639.82s)]
*  Levine was miserable. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3641.1s)]
*  Maybe he'll be thrilled that DeRozan's gone, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3641.94s)]
*  not taking his late game possessions. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3643.82s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3646.94s)]
*  Maybe a little overtaste for you there. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3647.78s)]
*  Billion dollar is not gonna like- [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3649.9s)]
*  I was talking about it. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3650.74s)]
*  I was like, boy, his uniform wasn't iron. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3651.78s)]
*  You can't even get the wrinkles out for picture day? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3657.5s)]
*  We like Bud Zelis though. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3662.62s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3664.86s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3665.7s)]
*  I mean, he was fun. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3666.54s)]
*  He's raw. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3667.38s)]
*  He was a fun draw prospect to watch. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3668.22s)]
*  But if he can't shoot it, he's toast. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3669.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3671.46s)]
*  There was some interesting training camp quotes [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3672.3s)]
*  from the coaches and teammates [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3675.62s)]
*  that they seemed unusually high on him. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3677.9s)]
*  I know they have to say whatever about the rookies, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3680.1s)]
*  but they were kind of like, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3682.06s)]
*  Donovan after the first practice was gone, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3684.02s)]
*  he's gonna play for us. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3686.66s)]
*  He was just like, just point blank. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3688.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3689.9s)]
*  I'm gonna solve this now. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3690.74s)]
*  There's gonna be no G League for this guy. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3691.78s)]
*  He's playing for us. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3693.18s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3694.34s)]
*  It's a Josh Gideon investor relations call. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3697.38s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3699.62s)]
*  I'm not here. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3700.46s)]
*  Not interested. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3705.42s)]
*  He's not subscribed to the call. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3707.42s)]
*  No, I don't wanna talk to the investors. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3708.82s)]
*  About Josh Gideon? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3711.22s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3712.06s)]
*  Are you gonna play dumb [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3713.7s)]
*  because you bought so much Josh Gideon stock? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3714.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3716.22s)]
*  Rossella and I were the only two people [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3717.94s)]
*  who liked that trade last summer. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3719.2599999999998s)]
*  We went all in on it. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3720.5s)]
*  And I liked it for both teams. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3722.3s)]
*  I just thought, I'm in on Josh Gideon still. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3723.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3726.14s)]
*  I think he's a good basketball player. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3726.98s)]
*  And I don't wanna take the under [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3729.1s)]
*  because I was actually rooting for them [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3730.42s)]
*  to be fun to watch so that we would be right [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3732.58s)]
*  about the Gideon trade. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3734.54s)]
*  But that 28 and a half is too high for me. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3735.38s)]
*  So I am going under. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3739.1s)]
*  Well, it's 27 and a half. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3740.2599999999998s)]
*  Does that change your mind? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3741.9s)]
*  Is that what it is right now? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3743.22s)]
*  I thought so. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3744.8999999999996s)]
*  No, it went up to 28 and a half. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3745.9399999999996s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3747.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3748.14s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3748.98s)]
*  No, it's 28 and a half. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3749.8199999999997s)]
*  Maybe I have to get out of this. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3750.66s)]
*  That's it? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3752.4199999999996s)]
*  So 29? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3753.2599999999998s)]
*  I'll stay in. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3754.7799999999997s)]
*  29's still pretty crappy. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3755.62s)]
*  What do you mean 29? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3757.2999999999997s)]
*  That's what it is then? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3758.18s)]
*  I understand. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3759.02s)]
*  I got you. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3759.8399999999997s)]
*  Over. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3760.68s)]
*  And then I get rewarded for my commitment. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3761.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's 28 and a half. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3763.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3764.2599999999998s)]
*  28 and a half, I'm gonna stick with my over. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3765.1s)]
*  Statmuse, what is the Chicago over under? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3766.8999999999996s)]
*  Here's the weather in Tampa. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3769.4199999999996s)]
*  42. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3770.4599999999996s)]
*  All right, so house is over. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3772.3s)]
*  Russel and I are under. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3773.82s)]
*  Last but not least, the Detroit Pistons. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3774.94s)]
*  They're over under, it's 25 and a half. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3779.94s)]
*  They have a new head coach, JB Bickerstaff. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3781.6600000000003s)]
*  They won 14 games last year. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3784.38s)]
*  They added Tim Hardaway Jr., Malik Beasley, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3785.82s)]
*  and the one and only Tobias Harris, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3790.54s)]
*  who finally is unleashed. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3794.42s)]
*  Right system, right time. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3797.54s)]
*  Plus 980 for the playoffs, just throwing it out there. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3800.22s)]
*  Cunningham. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3805.54s)]
*  After the All-Star break, 25, five and eight. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3808.74s)]
*  39% from three. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3810.7799999999997s)]
*  I was gonna have an investor relations call, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3813.74s)]
*  but I think we're good. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3815.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think we need one about Cunningham. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3816.14s)]
*  It got really scary when there was that [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3816.98s)]
*  ringer piece from Zach on Cade. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3818.74s)]
*  I'm gonna go, wait, he's a super inefficient, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3820.74s)]
*  high volume guy, like I hate these players. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3822.54s)]
*  Why don't my stat? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3824.9399999999996s)]
*  And then things got a lot better. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3825.7799999999997s)]
*  But not great. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3827.42s)]
*  I can't believe this team won one less game [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3830.7400000000002s)]
*  with this roster than the Wizards did. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3833.0600000000004s)]
*  Monty Williams, this has gotta be one of the worst [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3835.98s)]

*  he was surprised about players on his own team. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3842.54s)]
*  It was a robbery. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3847.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, like apparently he didn't want it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3848.7000000000003s)]
*  It was like Den of Thebes too. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3850.78s)]
*  Monty Williams goes to Detroit and just steals 80 million [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3852.2200000000003s)]
*  from them. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3855.7000000000003s)]
*  We're closing games with Cunningham. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3856.62s)]
*  Who's not in the league. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3857.94s)]
*  Who's not in the league as a lottery pick. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3858.7799999999997s)]
*  Over Ivy. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3861.14s)]
*  Yeah, we were talking about it when it happened. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3862.86s)]
*  I like the over, 25 and a half. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3864.54s)]
*  Love the over. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3866.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3867.18s)]
*  I think this team's gonna be frisky. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3868.02s)]
*  All of us. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3868.86s)]
*  Me too, they're trying. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3869.7s)]
*  With these acquisitions, show that they're trying. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3870.7s)]
*  If you just go through the team. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3873.18s)]
*  Is there a better point guard depth chart [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3875.3s)]
*  than Cade, Sasser, Ivy, Wendell Moore? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3876.7799999999997s)]
*  Pretty good. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3879.58s)]
*  Solid. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3881.18s)]
*  Maybe the best in the league? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3882.02s)]
*  Listen, Thompson, I thought had some interesting moments [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3883.74s)]
*  last year, he's at least a rebounding defense guy. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3887.5s)]
*  Fantequio was so good, Utah was like, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3890.5s)]
*  we just gotta fucking get rid of this guy. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3892.7799999999997s)]
*  He's gonna fuck up our draft pick. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3894.58s)]
*  Bobby Klintman finally in the league. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3896.06s)]
*  Ron Holland. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3898.3399999999997s)]
*  Big Stu. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3899.8999999999996s)]
*  They have Fred Vinson. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3900.74s)]
*  They hired Fred Vinson to come in and help these guys [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3901.9399999999996s)]
*  learn how to shoot. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3904.66s)]
*  Lamar Stevens gives you solid minutes. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3905.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, last year we were watching them going, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3908.5s)]
*  who put this team together and were they drunk? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3911.38s)]
*  Why did they just have all these big guys and guards [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3913.86s)]
*  and no shooting? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3916.6200000000003s)]
*  What made anyone think in 2023 [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3917.98s)]
*  this was the type of team you'd want to put together? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3920.2200000000003s)]
*  Now they have shooting. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3923.02s)]
*  They figured out at least we gotta just play [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3924.82s)]
*  Ivy and Cunningham together and let them figure it out. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3926.7400000000002s)]
*  They have rebounding. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3928.9s)]
*  Their center is one of the, I think, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3930.98s)]
*  four best rebounding title odds this year. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3933.2200000000003s)]
*  And then Harris. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3937.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3940.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm kind of rooting for him. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3941.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3942.3s)]
*  Mainly because it would enrage Brasillo [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3943.2200000000003s)]
*  if he scored like 24 a game for Detroit in the first month. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3944.9s)]
*  I am a happily over on this. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3949.34s)]
*  So, Brasillo, you're over. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3951.62s)]
*  And House is over. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3953.2200000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't be mad at Tobias Harris scoring buckets. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3954.78s)]
*  I feel like Philly didn't even appreciate him. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3957.58s)]
*  That was tough. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3962.38s)]
*  For the Tobias hive, it was tough with the take charge, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3963.54s)]
*  those, hey, he didn't take it in charge since like 2019. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3966.54s)]
*  Keep the game moving. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3971.6200000000003s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3972.46s)]
*  Less whistles. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3973.86s)]
*  So out of Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, Brooklyn, and Washington, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3975.2200000000003s)]
*  I think I like Detroit the most out of those five. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3980.5400000000004s)]
*  Say it again. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3982.94s)]
*  Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, Brooklyn, Washington, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3984.26s)]
*  and I'll throw in Charlotte too. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3986.7400000000002s)]
*  Chicago might be, even though I went under on it, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3988.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3991.26s)]
*  That was a reach. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3992.34s)]
*  Last night when I went to bed, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3993.1800000000003s)]
*  I didn't know what to do with this number, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3994.1400000000003s)]
*  but it's just the last ditch effort of the K to Ivy Wiseman. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=3995.34s)]
*  I'm just kidding, Wiseman's on the Pacers. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4000.94s)]
*  All right, so here's what we did. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4002.94s)]
*  Phoenix, 47 and a half. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4005.02s)]
*  We all went over. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4006.7400000000002s)]
*  I made it a lock. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4007.94s)]
*  Anyone else want to lock that down? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4009.42s)]
*  And we're gonna wait. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4010.6200000000003s)]
*  House is locking it down too. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4011.46s)]
*  I don't have to wait. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4012.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4013.9s)]
*  Lock. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4014.7400000000002s)]
*  You're locking it too? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4016.2200000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4017.0600000000004s)]
*  Okay. Wow. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4017.88s)]
*  So we had that. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4020.42s)]
*  We had the Sacramento Kings, 44 and a half. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4021.7000000000003s)]
*  We all went over on that. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4026.5800000000004s)]
*  Golden State Warriors, 43 and a half. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4028.0600000000004s)]
*  Russel and I went over. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4029.9s)]
*  House went under. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4030.98s)]
*  The Lakers, 42 and a half. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4033.2200000000003s)]
*  I really want to put a lock on it, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4036.98s)]
*  but I don't want to waste one. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4038.42s)]
*  We all went under on that. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4040.02s)]
*  And then Clippers, 37 and a half. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4041.58s)]
*  We all went under and I'm putting a lock down on that too, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4044.3s)]
*  because I don't think that team's gonna be very good [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4047.1800000000003s)]
*  and it's gonna be sad. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4051.42s)]
*  And then in the central, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4053.42s)]
*  Milwaukee, 50 and a half, we all went under. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4054.6600000000003s)]
*  Cleveland, 48 and a half. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4056.9s)]
*  We went over and me and House locked that one down. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4059.18s)]
*  You want to lock that down, Russel? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4062.5s)]
*  I'll give you my lock list when we're through it all. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4064.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4066.9s)]
*  Because I kind of like changed my mind [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4067.74s)]
*  in the course of today. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4068.98s)]
*  Totally fine. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4070.3399999999997s)]

*  You guys talked me into it. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4074.3799999999997s)]
*  We all went over. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4075.62s)]
*  Chicago, 28 and a half. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4077.3399999999997s)]
*  Under for me, under for Russel. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4080.06s)]
*  Over for House. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4081.58s)]
*  And then finally, Detroit. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4084.2599999999998s)]
*  Over 25 and a half. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4086.22s)]
*  We all said that sounds great. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4087.62s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8-Ra24suY&t=4090.1s)]
