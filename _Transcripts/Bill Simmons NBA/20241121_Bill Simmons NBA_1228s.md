# An NBA 6-Pack Heat Culture In Trouble, All-Star Game Fixes & Much More  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlSdQ6Aq1k)
*  All right, we're gonna start with an NBA six pack.
*  I haven't done this in a while.
*  I haven't talked to NBA in over a week,
*  which is my fault.
*  I'm not perfect.
*  I have six things that I wanted to throw at you.
*  None of them have to do with the Philadelphia 76ers
*  because we're gonna be talking about them later today
*  with Chris Ryan and Joe House.
*  First thing, the Clippers without Paul George.
*  So I took the under as a lock
*  before the season and over under podcast with the Clippers,
*  37 and a half.
*  I didn't see how they were gonna have enough scoring,
*  which is James Harden, Norman Powell.
*  I didn't understand why they didn't give Paul George
*  four years max.
*  You're already all in with this Kawhi contract.
*  Why not just go all the way in on your team?
*  Well, what did they know?
*  I remember mentioning this in one of the podcasts.
*  It's like, hmm, Ballmer,
*  guy who just spends money like absolute fucking crazy.
*  And this Paul George thing was too rich for his blood.
*  What did they know?
*  You have an athlete on your team,
*  in this case for five full years, half a decade,
*  and your trainers see stuff, your coaching staff sees stuff.
*  Something about it made them a little wary
*  of committing to a guy in his mid-30s
*  who had had a major awful broken leg,
*  some other knee stuff.
*  Something made them go,
*  this time it's too rich for our blood,
*  which is interesting because they did this
*  with Blake Griffin when they signed Blake Griffin
*  to a Big Macs deal and then traded him.
*  Like four months later, and it was like,
*  oh my God, they traded Blake Griffin, what are they doing?
*  And then what happened?
*  Blake Griffin's body broke down within two years.
*  You watch Paul George,
*  now he's hyper-extended the same knee twice,
*  so you could say, oh, that's a little fluky.
*  When he came back from the injury between those two injuries,
*  he didn't look great.
*  And if you're a Sixers fan staring at that Max contract,
*  I think you're in a complete panic.
*  But here's why you can't celebrate too much
*  with the Clippers.
*  They did offer Paul George three years for 150.
*  So it's not like they were like, we're out.
*  We want no part of the Paul George business.
*  They kind of wanted it at their price.
*  What was smart was when they had a chance
*  to sign and trade him,
*  which is something that teams have done a lot in the past
*  where they was like, well, we have this asset,
*  we got to turn it in.
*  And all of a sudden they're taking these contracts back.
*  They were smart enough not to do that.
*  They didn't do it with Gold State,
*  had some possible trades.
*  Denver they supposedly talked to.
*  So they turned the Paul George money
*  into Derek Jones and Chris Dunn 45 million for three years.
*  So that's about one third of what Paul George would have cost.
*  And then Nick Pattoon one year 4.9.
*  It looks like he might be washed.
*  But they had the ability now to slap contracts
*  for bigger deals, slap them together, whatever.
*  And the big bet was Ken Norman Powell
*  shoulders some of this burden.
*  And he actually has.
*  So I've been watching them
*  because I've been rooting against them
*  because I love being right.
*  And they're nine and seven.
*  They've had a tough schedule.
*  It's been like the opposite of a Laker schedule.
*  You know it's true Laker fans.
*  You know like this win streak,
*  like you haven't played anybody.
*  You know that's true deep down.
*  Clippers nine and seven.
*  They played Houston twice.
*  They played Golden State twice.
*  They played Phoenix twice.
*  They played OKC, Sacramento, Orlando and Denver.
*  There's nothing going on here.
*  I'll tell you one other thing.
*  I think the arena is really good.
*  They played the Warriors last Monday
*  and I really wanted to go
*  and we had a Spotify thing I couldn't go.
*  And somebody who was there told me something.
*  Somebody that's worked for the team for a while
*  told me something that I thought was a great point.
*  It was the first Warriors game
*  the Clippers have had as a home game
*  where the Warriors fans didn't drown out the Clipper fans.
*  Where it actually felt like a Clippers home game
*  and they ended up winning.
*  It was a classic Clippers Warriors game
*  where the Warriors played that crap.
*  The Clippers looked great.
*  Then all of a sudden the Warriors
*  they were scrapping together
*  trying to win at the end they didn't.
*  But whatever Ballmer did with that arena
*  which is really cool and the wall
*  and the fans close together
*  and trying to monitor some of the ticket stuff
*  it actually worked in that Warriors game.
*  So I'm a little more bullish on the Clippers
*  than I used to be.
*  That's the first one.
*  Speaking of the Warriors, it's a tiny one.
*  Second in the six pack.
*  The D'Anthony Melton injury
*  was a really, really secretly huge injury.
*  There's been so many injuries this year
*  it kind of got lost in the shuffle.
*  But he had really unlocked them.
*  He was really good next to Curry.
*  He was an excellent on ball defender.
*  A good shooter.
*  They were fourth in defensive rating before he got hurt.
*  And he was a great fit with Curry.
*  And he hurt his knee and it was like,
*  then they said it was a sprained ACL.
*  And then all of a sudden he's getting ACL surgery.
*  And it just hurts them.
*  They're not the same team.
*  They've been trying to throw people in that spot
*  and we'll see how it goes with them.
*  But he was the perfect fit
*  and it kind of exposed the secret issue with Clay
*  the last couple of years
*  where he kind of couldn't guard anybody.
*  If you have Curry that doesn't need to be totally protected
*  because he's a really good off ball defender.
*  But you want somebody else taking that burden
*  of going against the John Moran types night after night.
*  Melton was doing it.
*  I'm just watching it
*  because I loved how the Warriors played
*  the last time we did the power pole.
*  I was talking about how I had them as a sleeper
*  but I really thought maybe they could be a real contender
*  and they still might be.
*  But the Melton thing definitely hurts.
*  So I didn't want to not mention that.
*  Third thing for the six pack, Houston.
*  They have the look.
*  I know the look.
*  They have the look.
*  Third defensive rating, 11th offense.
*  The terror twins, Amen Thompson and Tarre Easton
*  have been my, they're not the league pack.
*  They're not like best Oscar winner, best actor.
*  I'm not even positive they're best supporting actor
*  but there's something, I don't know what Oscar they would win.
*  They come in and they flip these games.
*  They just have so much athleticism
*  and so much defense between those two.
*  They're terrifying.
*  It's a little like what Orlando had last year.
*  It's a little like what OKC has sometimes.
*  But they have like, it's something to watch
*  and especially if you're gambling on games
*  and you like player props and stuff.
*  Like watch when Houston goes against teams
*  that have good swings.
*  Like they played Indiana, Matheran at eight points.
*  They played Chicago, Levine had 15.
*  They had back to backs against the Quippers.
*  This is what really jumped out to me
*  because I actually watched those games.
*  Harden was fucking useless against Houston
*  between Brooks and then the terror twins.
*  Like it was, you could kind of see him
*  like I'm tapping out.
*  I don't like this.
*  I'm not having a good time.
*  Harden and Powell on back to back games were 21 for 58.
*  12 free throw attempts total and they only scored 60 points
*  and Houston swept those games.
*  And I just think defensively there's really something here.
*  I don't even, I said this when we did the Power Pole.
*  I don't even think they know what their team has yet.
*  Like Jabari Smith will have some games
*  where he only plays like 22 minutes,
*  only scores four points.
*  He's a guy that if you're gonna say
*  who is not gonna be on this team in a year,
*  maybe that's the guy.
*  Cause I think he's a real asset.
*  They were playing small ball five with them last year.
*  He's only 9.7 million this year.
*  He could be the focal point of a trade
*  if they want to make a trade.
*  They've already said publicly
*  they don't want to make a trade.
*  That they're happy to have the kind of what Orlando
*  had last year with OKC had two years ago
*  of we're young, we're hungry.
*  Let's see where this goes,
*  which I think is the right mentality.
*  But they do have a lot of picks.
*  They do have Jabari as the centerpiece
*  of if you're actually getting a player back in the trade.
*  So I'm just watching them and I'm watching them in general
*  cause I really liked them.
*  Tuesday night, Houston at Minnesota
*  with the Tara twins and Brooks going against Edwards
*  is I think the league pass game of the year
*  that isn't Celtics Cleveland.
*  Cause I don't think that was a league pass game,
*  but I want to see them go toe to toe
*  with that Minnesota team.
*  Houston to me is a top five team in the West.
*  I've been taking them very seriously
*  and I love the Tara twins.
*  So that's my third thing.
*  Fourth thing,
*  just a question.
*  Did Heat Culture die when they didn't get Dane?
*  Because here's what's happened since.
*  Remember they had already drafted Hawkeyes,
*  which is the last really smart Heat moment we've had.
*  Since then, the 2024 Knicks, last year's Knicks team
*  kind of stole their identity
*  as like the defense chemistry overachieving team.
*  They had a terrible year.
*  Riley got mad at Butler.
*  The Rozier trade turned out to be kind of blah.
*  And I'll admit, I liked the Rozier trade for them.
*  He was playing great for Charlotte.
*  He's been kind of blah for them.
*  He's averaging 13 points a game.
*  There's times out there,
*  he might be the Tobias Harris award,
*  Rosillo's joke about,
*  oh, I didn't realize Terry Rozier was out there.
*  He's had some moments like that.
*  BAM's gone backwards.
*  Now, I assume that's gonna turn around,
*  but I'm just pointing out,
*  he doesn't look like a top 15 player in the league.
*  Nikola Jović, who they were all excited about.
*  Blah.
*  They're getting 24 points a game
*  in a 49-45-88 shooting season from Tyler Hero.
*  And as we're taping this on a Thursday,
*  they're six and seven.
*  And Boston and Cleveland seems like
*  they're miles ahead of them.
*  But the big thing for me,
*  and a lot of people have talked about this this week,
*  and this is like,
*  the Heat fans get mad every time I talk about the Heat.
*  Did the 15th pick in the draft.
*  They drafted Ware, the center, who barely plays.
*  And they passed on back-to-back picks.
*  Jared McCain goes to Philly,
*  and Connect goes to the Lakers.
*  And in the old days, the Heat,
*  if McCain was on the board at 15,
*  like, forget about Connect.
*  I like Connect, but I can see it.
*  He's 24, they already have shooters
*  who don't really play defense.
*  Like, I get it.
*  McCain was the most Miami pick.
*  I couldn't believe it in the moment.
*  If you go back to my Twitter feed,
*  I was going nuts about McCain.
*  I thought, I was like, this guy,
*  I know this guy's good,
*  because he was an LA kid.
*  I watched him play in high school a bunch of times.
*  He was my favorite kind of post-Lowder guy in the draft,
*  by far.
*  I would have bet anything McCain was gonna be a good player.
*  And they passed on him.
*  And maybe it's nothing, everybody misses on picks.
*  They had Hero, they took Bam.
*  They took Hawkeyes.
*  They're clearly really good at drafting.
*  And they whiffed on this pick with two guys
*  that really, really, really could have helped them.
*  Big picture, I'm just not afraid of the Heat anymore.
*  I think I finally, it's like the horror movie
*  where you're not looking under your bed.
*  I'm just not looking under my bed anymore with the Heat.
*  Great run, 2020, 23, and it's over.
*  And we'll see what they do with it.
*  But that McCain-Connect thing is symbolic
*  of something that shifted with those guys.
*  Fifth thing on the six pack.
*  So the NBA All-Star game, Shams Charania, now VSPN,
*  reported that they're gonna do a four-team tournament
*  this year.
*  And they're gonna have three All-Star teams,
*  eight players each.
*  And then they're gonna have the winner
*  of the rookie sophomore game.
*  And so it's gonna be four teams competing,
*  semi-final games up to 40 points,
*  first team to 40, I guess, wins,
*  finals games up to 25 points.
*  As usual, they didn't consult with me,
*  even though I would put my track record
*  of great, goofy NBA ideas against anyone
*  in the 21st century.
*  I just would just go look at the track record, it's there.
*  I don't know why the rookie sophomore guys are in this.
*  And I don't know why each team has eight players.
*  If they had asked me, what do you think,
*  I would have said four All-Star teams,
*  six players each, so there's one sub.
*  Has anybody who made this decision
*  ever played pick-up basketball?
*  Who has three subs in pick-up basketball?
*  It sucks.
*  I remember playing in a league one year in Boston
*  when we had like nine players on the,
*  and it was like short games,
*  and you're just shuttling guys in and out
*  like it was hockey and it sucked.
*  I would have done four All-Star teams.
*  I would have done six players each.
*  Had the signature players of the league
*  be the captain of those teams.
*  So you have Steph, you have Giannis,
*  you have LeBron, and maybe Jokic.
*  I don't know, however you want to do it.
*  Sorry, NBA, dude, make the cut.
*  And done six players, then each player's a sub.
*  And by the way, if somebody gets hurt,
*  you still have five players.
*  Maybe there's like a 25th All-Star
*  who's like the emergency QB
*  who can come in at any point if two guys are hurt.
*  I just don't get the eight players thing.
*  And I don't understand why anybody wants to watch
*  the rookie sophomore guys playing against these dudes.
*  Not to mention, those guys are actually gonna be
*  really trying and maybe that's why they did it.
*  Maybe they wanted the All-Stars to try against
*  the rookie sophomores, but it's like,
*  that's a pretty big spot to throw a rookie team in,
*  especially when you have the draft that we had this year
*  that was pretty uninspired, the sophomores, whatever.
*  But I just, it was an easy tweak.
*  I don't know how they fucked this up.
*  As usual, they didn't ask me.
*  Sixth and last, I think Milwaukee's gonna be fine.
*  That's where I landed.
*  I don't think they're gonna win the title.
*  I don't even think they're necessarily gonna make
*  the Eastern Finals, but I didn't think that
*  before the season.
*  What was in play for the first three weeks was
*  this could be an all-time disaster.
*  They're gonna have to trade Giannis.
*  It just felt like all the darkest pieces of the season
*  were sitting there.
*  Giannis is averaging a 32, 12, and six.
*  It's like his seventh straight year
*  where he's looked like one of the three best players
*  in the league at worst.
*  Dame has not shot the ball well,
*  and they're still six and nine with three horrible losses.
*  One that actually seemed like there should have been
*  a criminal investigation with the officiating.
*  But six and nine easily could be nine and six.
*  Three of the dumbest losses of the season.
*  Green and Prince, two swing guys for them,
*  both shooting 50% from three.
*  So Doc has just figured out,
*  I'm probably just gonna give up defense with the swings.
*  I just wanna make sure guys can make shots.
*  That's why somebody like AJ Green is playing.
*  And they're not a top 14.
*  I don't think they're there with Boston, Cleveland,
*  New York, or Orlando.
*  But after that, I don't know who I'd like more
*  than Giannis and the Bucks.
*  I'd probably have them fifth.
*  And all they need to do is get to the playoffs.
*  And then you have Giannis, and you can try to stay healthy,
*  and maybe you can find one shooter.
*  They're minus 700 for the playoffs on FanDuel,
*  which I think is notable.
*  Should also mention FanDuel does not have odds
*  for Philly to make the playoffs.
*  You literally can't find them,
*  because that's how crazy this Philly season's been.
*  But I'm leaning toward Milwaukee's probably okay.
*  Maybe they're not one of the favorites, but they're okay.
*  This isn't gonna be like a catastrophe of a season.
*  Philly is not okay,
*  and we're gonna be talking about that later.
*  So that's a six pack for the NBA.
*  But I have to bring in Steve Cerruti, Orlando Magic fan.
*  There's some Franz Wagner atoning we have to do.
*  I handed my Ringer 100 list over a week ago.
*  I think I had Franz in the low 60s.
*  The list itself didn't do very well.
*  All Franz has done over the last two weeks is said,
*  not only are we not gonna miss Paolo,
*  but I'm actually an all NBA player,
*  and sign me up for this list.
*  Is this a fluke, or is this real?
*  I think it's real.
*  I will say my biggest gripe with Franz
*  is that in the past with Paolo,
*  when he would go on these quarter stretches
*  where he'd clearly be the guy and on a streak,
*  they just wouldn't give him the ball,
*  or he wouldn't be proactive and be like,
*  no, I'm that dude right now.
*  Paolo, take a step back.
*  And I think this, you never wanna say
*  that injury is a blessing in disguise,
*  but I kinda feel like Franz has found his groove again
*  because he's just the guy now.
*  And I'm kinda hoping in the long term,
*  this is gonna translate to a little bit,
*  taking some of the pressure off of Paolo,
*  and Franz realizing, hey, there are stretches
*  where I can be that dude.
*  Because he's averaging 37 and six.
*  A six game winning streak, obviously,
*  we're recording this after the loss
*  against the Clippers last night,
*  and he didn't have a great game, but it's okay.
*  He had six straight great games.
*  This is everything that we wanted, a max player.
*  This is everything that we thought he was gonna be.
*  And I'm looking at the ring of rankings right now.
*  It's doing my guy disservice.
*  It really is.
*  I love you guys, man.
*  Where did he end up in the ring of rankings?
*  In the 50s?
*  He's 48.
*  Wow.
*  Which is, he's behind Scotty Barnes.
*  He's behind, I mean, there are just some guys,
*  like he's behind Dame, and he's behind Paul George.
*  I know there's the name recognition,
*  but you're telling me the Sixers right now,
*  not for the next two, three, four, five years.
*  This year, the Sixers would much rather have Franz
*  than Paul George.
*  The Bucks would much rather have Franz
*  than Damien Lillard.
*  I don't even think it's close.
*  So I know the name thing,
*  we wanna give those guys respect, but that's insane.
*  In our defense, when the first couple weeks,
*  Franz couldn't hit a three, and it's like,
*  what's going on?
*  Where's Team Germany Franz?
*  Is that guy coming back?
*  It's around 35% right now.
*  It's not terrible.
*  It could be better.
*  I still think it could be improved, but he's fine.
*  Team Germany Franz seems like he's back.
*  It's pretty exciting.
*  He's got his brother.
*  He doesn't need Dennis Schroeder.
*  He proved, who knows, the trade deadline's still,
*  maybe the Magic will be looking for a point guard.
*  I kinda hope it's not him.
*  But he just looks so much more confident, man.
*  The defense is really good.
*  He's like one of,
*  where I have a couple stats here, hold on.
*  He's one of eight players averaging 25 rebounds,
*  four assists, and 4.5 steals a game.
*  That's Luca, De'Aaron Fox, SGA, Harden, Jokic, Tatum,
*  and Jalen Williams.
*  He's on very impressive lists.
*  So I just love this.
*  It's like the Franz Renaissance thing,
*  proving he's a max player.
*  Who knows?
*  Apollo is gonna be out probably at least another month or so.
*  So this is the thing.
*  It's probably gonna keep rolling.
*  Yeah, the thing you needed was, with Palo going out,
*  how can Orlando keep their spot
*  as either the third or the fourth seed?
*  How can you make sure you stay in the,
*  you're gonna win the division?
*  Although I don't even know
*  if winning the division matters anymore.
*  But nine and seven, losing your best guy
*  for God knows how long is not a bad place to be.
*  We're taping this before the Lakers game,
*  but the pod's going up for the Lakers game.
*  The thing with the Lakers,
*  they don't have really anyone on their roster
*  to guard good scoring wings like this,
*  or good point guards, by the way.
*  And they've had this stretch where they've won some games.
*  But part of the reason they're winning the games
*  is because they can play this lineup
*  with Connect and Reeves and LeBron and D-Low altogether,
*  because they don't have to worry about guarding anyone.
*  I wanna see if Franz can light up the Lakers tonight.
*  Because I think he can.
*  It's the type of guy that I don't even know
*  who they'd have to guard him.
*  So we'll see.
*  I'm glad Franz is back.
*  I'm glad for your sanity.
*  You're back in on the Max player bandwagon.
*  You're back.
*  We flip-flopped a little this summer,
*  but you're back now.
*  It's good to have you.
*  Well, and then the other thing is Anthony Black,
*  the last time we talked about this,
*  continues to be making strides.
*  So they're laying the foundation.
*  They're not in the Cleveland-Boston swimming pool,
*  but they're at the pool right next to it doing laps.
*  No, but you know what?
*  I was talking to a buddy about this.
*  The East is weird, because I think before the season,
*  we were like, hey, it's Boston,
*  then it's kind of the next two through eight or nine.
*  I don't know, it could be between two to three games.
*  Could be the difference at the end of the season.
*  Now it feels totally different to me now.
*  It feels like the Magic should get a home playoff series.
*  The top four things should be a thing this year.
*  Right, and you have a home playoff series.
*  That could be against Miami.
*  That could be against Milwaukee.
*  You want the home court.
*  You want the game seven.
*  And then when did they say Palos coming back?
*  Originally, I think it was six to eight weeks,
*  but that was a reevaluation period.
*  So we still have another at least month to go,
*  which you know what?
*  It's all right.
*  Just, you know, Franz is holding it down.
*  And I'm just hoping that there was a little bit of like,
*  hey, creeping into my mind of like,
*  can these two guys peak coexist together?
*  They're both good together, but can it?
*  And I'm just hoping like,
*  because this team is so Franz dependent,
*  before he went out or before Paolo went down,
*  like I remember talking to Raheem about this,
*  this team is gonna be awful to watch.
*  They might win some games, but awful.
*  And they've been significantly better.
*  So the hope is that, you know,
*  Franz sort of realizes that, hey, I'm that dude too.
*  And I'm an all-star caliber player,
*  which I've thought for a while now.
*  So we'll see.
*  Yeah, I was wondering if they're gonna be almost
*  like the Steelers where they're winning 18 to 16
*  and getting six field goals,
*  with like whatever the NBA version of that.
*  But yeah, they've been a little more fun than that.
