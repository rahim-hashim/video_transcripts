# The Knicks Run, the State of NY Sports, and More With Wesley Morris | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1PsLnDXP2Q)
*  You get pigeonholed as a movie guy and a culture guy, but your sports fandom,
*  it's been kind of slept on. You got caught up in this whole Knicks run and what it meant to the
*  city. Give us your, give us your, the Knicks have been slowly, their needles have been pulled out
*  of their quills and now they have no guys left. Just what was the last couple of weeks like?
*  It was really exciting. You know, to just be walking around New York City on game days when
*  they were, there were seven games, right? So there were four opportunities to see people
*  making their way to Madison Square Garden. And you knew that's where they were going when you see
*  them all kitted out. And it was so, it was like fathers and sons, every like many different races
*  and ethnicities and age groups. And, you know, it just, it w I didn't go to any of the games this
*  year, but I don't know. It just, it was an exciting feeling. It was quite, you know,
*  the, the, the blowouts were so confusing because you were just like, what is, what is momentum?
*  You know, that's a conversation that you can have. You've had it. But this team is great. They're
*  young. They're exciting. You know, Randall Randall has been injured since what? January. Yeah. You
*  know, they didn't have everybody wasn't there. Everybody didn't play, but you know, Brunson,
*  Steven Chenzo, Hartenstein, the, I mean, the, it was exciting to see these guys come together
*  and not care about the past. You know, I'm a big history person. I think history is important
*  everywhere except for sports. When you were playing a sport, you don't want to think about
*  history. History should be the last thing on your mind. And I just think that they're, that team has
*  no burden. Right? Well, maybe now they will. We'll see what happens next year. Right now they have
*  expectations. Right. But there's now a certain, it's no, it's not going to be surprising to see
*  them like almost get to the, to the Eastern conference final. People are going to expect
*  them to be in the final. Right. You know what you just laid out? Cause this is the number one
*  thing I miss about living in Boston when there's a big series or a big game and just the different,
*  and I remember writing about this once upon a time, but the energy that you could just feel
*  at like three 30 on the afternoon, just everybody's dressed and everybody, it's almost like everybody's
*  going to war on the same day. And it's a specific energy to walking cities. Cause I don't think
*  has it because everyone's in their cars, but like in Boston, you feel it in New York city. You feel
*  it. I don't even think like in Washington DC, you would feel it. Cause Washington's not like a big,
*  it's a little walking city. You know what I mean? Chicago's a little more spread out.
*  But the capital is like the best you're going to do down there. Yeah. Dallas, a lot of people in
*  their cars, but like when you have a city where people are just walking around every day and then
*  there's the big game and it's like this, everyone's suddenly wearing costumes almost for the game.
*  It's like everywhere you look, it's like Knicks, but now it's the Rangers, right? The Knicks didn't
*  make it, but MSG is still in use, baby. Yeah. And that could have been having both of those
*  at the same time. Dallas basically has that now with the hockey team and the basketball team.
*  Boston almost had it with the, with the, uh, the Bruins got knocked out, but it is when they're
*  both going at the same time, it's amazing. Cause it's like every day for a month and a half.
*  It's really exciting. The Rangers, I think, I mean, some of those guys kind of scare me a little bit,
*  but I mean, generally the vibe is exciting. Like I've been really tempted to go to a range. I'm
*  going to find the time depending on like where it was. Take a ranger game for God's sake, Jesus.
*  But it's exciting. It's like a really, New York is just really fun to just even walk by bars and see
*  people losing their minds. Right. Just random bars. People were screaming. I mean, I've got
*  a spot I like to go to and on my way there, you see people in other bars also watching
*  these Knicks games. And it's just like, I love it here so much. So Brunson's the guy now.
*  I mean, I think, well, it's who is the stop the restaurant New York athlete. Is it Brunson?
*  No, it's Steven Chinzo. It's over Brunson. I mean, not over. Well, it depends on where you go,
*  Bill. I don't know. Aaron Rodgers? Your guy Aaron? No, I don't think that. I think that we just want
*  to look the other way. Now, it was exciting a year ago. Aaron Judge. Oh, you mean of all the teams?
*  Yeah. Aaron Judge. I mean, who's the stop the restaurant guy? Split second. Everyone goes silent.
*  At this point, it's Brunson, right? Like if anybody from the Knicks goes out to eat,
*  they're eating not only for free. Well, I mean, I guess that's possible. Yeah, possible.
*  Flaws in the restaurant, right? Oh, yeah. Everybody gets an ovation. I mean, I, yeah.
*  How cool. I'm so happy that happened for the Knicks. It's exciting. And I think, I mean,
*  it's funny you mentioned Aaron Rodgers. I mean, I wonder, does he even go out in New York anymore?
*  I have not, you know, as you know, I've seen him around. I had been seeing him around and then the
*  injury happened and I haven't really seen him since. You made the key point. Out and about.
*  I mean, there's history in sports, which we love, but there's also no history because whatever's
*  happening next becomes the history. So all Rodgers has to do is go like five and oh in the jets.
*  Nobody's going to give a shit about anything. I don't know, Bill. He's still going to keep talking.
*  I mean, Kyrie figured it out. I mean, yeah, because I don't know. Well, what did Kyrie figure out?
*  Well, I think he's probably happy on the new team. He's a little bit older.
*  Maybe he has a better understanding of cause and effect where it's like if there's a commotion
*  off the court about something involving me, maybe that's bad for my team. And he just seems like
*  he's, you know, at this point of his career, pretty awesome teammate. He's been pretty reliable.
*  He hasn't caused any issues off the court. Do you think though that is somebody like,
*  do you think this is a place he reached on his own and how like mad New York was when he left?
*  Um, or maybe, or it's like a career. I guess is maybe another way to put it.
*  You know, you hit a, it's like a career fork in the road thing combined with he's playing with
*  somebody who's better than him, which I think helps. But then also he's playing with a coach
*  who, you know, has a pretty no nonsense. It was one of the great point guards ever.
*  What's weird though is he was in kind of a similar situation in Brooklyn and it went the
*  complete other way. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Nash was the Jason kid and Durant was the Luca.
*  And for some reason that didn't work out, but I think we see with sports a lot.
*  Sometimes guys just figure it out later in their career. I also think that like, I mean,
*  this is the thing that, that, that, you know, very well, but like casting, right. It's a really huge,
*  no matter how good you are on, on the T like, you know, that was bad casting for the nets.
*  Right. It was, well, you have a player, a player run culture. So now he moves into a Dallas team
*  where the culture is already established. It's already built around Luca. It's built around
*  Jason kid and their GM Cubans there. They have big forceful personalities and you kind of have
*  to fit into it. I think wanting to win a championship is way more important at some point when you get
*  a certain age. If you are in, if it's in sight, you're just going to, I think you might just want
*  to focus on that and not all that extracurricular stuff. I don't know. And they paid them. They took
*  care of them. They gave them a three year deal. Yeah. I mean, I love this Mavericks team. I'm
*  curious. I don't like, I hate that they're up against the timber. I don't want, I mean, I'm so.
*  Well, you must love Edwards. I mean, it can never be a final. It's, it checks a lot of your boxes.
*  Such an original personality. Star, star, star. And, and the thing that's exciting about Edwards,
*  Edwards is like, he loves playing basketball. He loves playing basketball. Even when he can't play
*  basketball, he loves playing basketball. Right. He loves playing sports. He just, I think he's in the
*  running for most authentic, genuine new athlete we've had in a long time. Cause I think, I think
*  everything he's doing would translate to whatever sport he played. If he played baseball, I think
*  people would respond to that. You know, baseball needs him so bad. I mean, I mean,
*  well, that's all golf. Every sport needs an Anthony Edwards, right? Somebody who has just
*  like a joie de vivre. But who also is really good at the game and unafraid and authentic and joyful
*  about playing it. That's why it's been a love fest for him for years. Alcaraz is one of these people.
*  Right. Like, oh yeah. I mean, have you ever seen Alcaraz lose when Alcaraz is losing? I'll never
*  forget this at the U S open last year when Medvedev cleaned his clock, he was out there
*  on the court watching Medvedev play. What I would say was the match of Medvedev's life
*  against Alcaraz and Alcaraz was playing really well. He was missing a lot of stuff. That thing
*  Alcaraz does, which is like, I really want to entertain you and the points don't matter that
*  much. Cause I'm 21 and I'll be back. But Medvedev was like, I'm not having it and just played an
*  amazing match. But if you watched, I was close enough, I could see his, I mean, you could watch
*  his face at home too, but like between points during breaks on the changeovers, he just looked so
*  shocked by how well Medvedev was playing. And it was like, this is great tennis and I'm on court
*  losing to it. And my great tennis isn't as good as this guy's. And it just completely threw him off.
*  But he just was delighted even in his loss. He didn't, it was just, I don't know, it was very,
*  it was very moving and like exciting. Anthony Edwards has that. He has like, even if I'm like,
*  when he was not playing well, you know, for the first half of game seven, how many points did he
*  score? I think it was like one for seven. Yeah. In game seven. I mean, you know, just to, to watch
*  him figure it out, you would have never known he was losing. But then when it came together,
*  he just turned it into the credible Hulk and that was exciting. I don't know. I love him.
*  I really love what a great teammate he is. I love that he really wants to lift the other guys up on
*  the team and as just this alpha leader. And you can even see like, sometimes I, when somebody makes
*  a shot, they call timeout and they go to the bench and you could just see how the other guys like
*  drift to him and react to him. And it's just different. And that's the part that-
*  He's young. Yeah. It's not like, I mean, there's a gravitational force there that is so much bigger
*  than the sport itself. And I wonder what age does for that. And like, how does, I mean,
*  I don't mean to be crass about this, but like, what are the, what are the sports companies and
*  the, you know, energy drink companies and like, what are the endorsements? What are the messages
*  of the commercials that he starts to make? Is he just going to be another state farm guy
*  or are they going to like build a whole new campaign around a, like, I would say once in
*  a generation energy. I don't know what kind of, you know, hall of fame life he's going to have
*  as a player, but like, I haven't seen anybody come into the league who's got the energy he has. Like
*  Luca has that a little bit. I love watching Luca, you know, make crazy shots and seem like he should
*  be playing a different sport, but is playing basketball and is really good at it. But Anthony
*  Edwards is like a different thing. And I thought, you know, cause I remember when Kobe came in,
*  Kobe was super interesting. Like he, there was a thoughtfulness to him and. Oh, he seemed wise.
*  Yeah. And it was like, what's going on with this guy? He was living in Italy.
*  You know, and he was very comfortable in the spotlight. And there was just some unusual stuff
*  about him where some of the other guys that came into the league, even when like when Jordan came
*  in the league, you can go back and watch his Letterman interview that he does his first year.
*  Like he's it's like unpolished Jordan. Like he's not the guy that he would become in the late eighties.
*  He seems young and like, he's not that comfortable. Edwards is Edwards is like, even when he did
*  hustle with Sandler, he's super comfortable in that movie. It's like, how are you so good at acting?
*  You're like 20. So he's just a friend. It's so exciting. It's going to be fun to watch you go.
*  It's going to be fun to watch him represent Team USA at the end of July. I'm sure he's going to be.
*  Oh, my God. We get to watch him at the Olympics. I totally forgot. Yeah, we're in a good spot.
