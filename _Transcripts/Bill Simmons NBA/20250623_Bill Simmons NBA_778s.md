# Is Kevin Durant a Perfect Fit in Houston? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI)
*  We're in Tuck, Durant. We got traded. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=0.0s)]
*  So on the one hand, I feel like the league should pass a rule. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=3.36s)]
*  There should be no trades within 24 hours of NBA finals. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=6.24s)]
*  Game seven seems like a decent rule. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=9.36s)]
*  And then they're in, I don't know how you would enforce it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=11.28s)]
*  And, uh, and I thought it was a pretty fun trade. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=13.68s)]
*  I thought it was an awesome trade for Houston. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=17.2s)]
*  I just loved it for them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=19.92s)]
*  Uh, I don't, we could talk about the Phoenix part after, but why don't you just take, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=21.44s)]
*  don't even ask me a question. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=25.28s)]
*  Houston. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, we talked about this last week. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=27.28s)]
*  I had so many more assets in the trade. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=28.72s)]
*  They didn't give up Jabari Smith in the trade. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=30.88s)]
*  That's a fucking miracle. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=32.96s)]
*  Like for Phoenix to trade Durant, it just speaks to what I, I mentioned, I can't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=35.28s)]
*  remember the last pot I did, but it was Wednesday or Thursday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  But like, I just think the offers were so terrible. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=43.36s)]
*  Um, everyone lowballed them because everybody knew they had to trade them [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  before the draft and everybody knew they wanted to pick. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  And, uh, it ends up being Jaylen green, who I don't know if there's four teams that they [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  could spin him to for 33 million a year. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=58.32s)]
*  And then Dylan Brooks, who at 21, 22 million a year, I think is a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=61.44s)]
*  solid asset if you're trying to, trying to win games. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=66.4s)]
*  Um, and then the 10th pick and that's basically the trade. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=70.08s)]
*  So I think for Houston, no brainer, 10th pick wouldn't have played for them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=75.76s)]
*  Plus you, you get rid of Brooks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=80.48s)]
*  Now you get to play Tara Easton and Whitmore, basically give them those [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=82.16s)]
*  minutes plus, um, and Thompson, like I just thought, I thought the trade was a home run for them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=86.16s)]
*  Yeah, I loved it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=92.08s)]
*  I mean, stone is on an absolute heater. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=92.8s)]
*  He's, he's been incredible that draft picks, they've been incredible in how they've worked. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=95.52s)]
*  Uh, a lot of the stuff and yeah, we knew that they were limited offensively, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=101.6s)]
*  like the Durant market, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  The Durant market, if we go through it, you knew it was getting bad when you were just [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=106.8s)]
*  least hearing the rumors of like Miami won't include who first started with like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=111.6s)]
*  Klo where are you like, okay, I could see why you just wouldn't want to be in a hurry. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=115.04s)]
*  Or you would say no. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=118.0s)]
*  Until you think like, if you wanted to rant that bad, you're saying no about where for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  days until maybe then you finally give in. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=122.64s)]
*  But then you're like, haques wasn't come on. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Like there's no, there's no way because the salary piece that you're moving out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=128.32s)]
*  in Wiggins I think is less attractive than Brooks because Wiggins is probably going to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=131.36s)]
*  get you some numbers, but I don't know that he impacts the game the same way Brooks does. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, shout out to Brooks for all the jokes when the Lakers eliminated. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=140.32s)]
*  Granted, he brought a lot of it on himself and then he wouldn't do anything with the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=144.16s)]
*  media after they would lose. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=147.28s)]
*  So it's not like I was feeling bad for him, but like dudes didn't think he was going to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=148.48s)]
*  be in this league. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=151.28s)]
*  And I still think he's somebody who impacts games. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=152.56s)]
*  And when that contract came out and Houston gave all that money to Brooks and gave the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=155.6s)]
*  massive deal to Fred Van Vliet, a lot of us are going like, man, that is so much money [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  for that level of dude. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=163.68s)]
*  But it's like, well, we got to spend it on somebody. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=164.88s)]
*  We probably have to overspend this way now where Houston and they flip Brooks into [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=166.56s)]
*  Durant. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=170.96s)]
*  So there's just all these things you can look at with Stone being like, oh, he did that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=171.52s)]
*  right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  That worked out well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  So credit to him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=175.68s)]
*  Credit to the Rockets front office. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=176.56s)]
*  He went and got two guys who he knew could play in playoff series and they did. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=177.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=181.12s)]
*  So like the Yaka Pertle part of it, like, was he really not available? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=181.44s)]
*  Well, maybe not. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=186.24s)]
*  I'd probably like them a little bit more than Zach does. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=186.96s)]
*  And considering how expensive Toronto is, like they're going to have to get one of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  expensive guys, get like rid of one of those dudes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  When you heard the Knicks rumors, like now we've come full circle. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  It's like, well, first of all, apparently they didn't want him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=198.56s)]
*  But the early stuff on that was Mitchell Robinson and Ochi. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=200.88s)]
*  Now when I look at that, I'm like, Phoenix would have been pumped. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=204.48s)]
*  I love Mitchell Robinson now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=207.84s)]
*  Remember, I was thinking towns for Durant straight up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=209.12s)]
*  That's like three times what Houston paid. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=212.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=214.64s)]
*  So that's not happening. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=214.96s)]
*  And then when it comes back to Minnesota, I can understand like with Randall, the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=216.0s)]
*  playoff player option, which he probably opts into it like 30 million. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=218.88s)]
*  Because I don't think he wants to opt out and go to this free agent market. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=223.92s)]
*  But then it's like, if you're Phoenix, do you want to get in the Randall business for [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=226.64s)]
*  30 plus another 60 plus million over two years? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=229.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't know that there's a ton of teams that want to do that kind of stuff. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  And then even San Antonio, and I'm finishing here quickly, but like San Antonio, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=236.48s)]
*  if they had done it and whatever their case was, I would have been like, okay, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  yeah, that makes sense. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  And if they don't do it, which obviously they didn't, then I could also understand [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=244.88s)]
*  their position on that one being like, yeah, maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense to add [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=248.56s)]
*  Durant here because you're not just adding a 37 year old player who's terrific score. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=251.2s)]
*  You're adding somebody who doesn't have the greatest history with how happy he stays [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=255.12s)]
*  with franchises and the fact that he's going to cost you like another 120 million, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=258.8s)]
*  which this probably was worked out ahead of time for him to be like signing off on this, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=262.24s)]
*  even though we had heard last summer right around this time, almost exactly to the day [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=266.08s)]
*  a year ago that he wanted Houston, but Phoenix didn't want to move them out. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=273.12s)]
*  So you put all that together and I think it kind of makes sense that this is what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=273.44s)]
*  the price ended up being, isn't it? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=278.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=281.92s)]
*  Well, for you, Houston, you're getting somebody who can shoot the ball in the last four minutes [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=282.8s)]
*  of a game and maybe appear on a panel about the future of the intersection between athletes [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=286.24s)]
*  and business. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  There we go. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=292.64s)]
*  Get those two, those two verticals covered now. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=293.12s)]
*  Are you mad that Ruben didn't invite you again this year? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=297.36s)]
*  I got invited. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=300.16s)]
*  I just went to New York. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=300.88s)]
*  But you didn't go. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=302.88s)]
*  White party. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=304.72s)]
*  You going to that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't go back Eastern in the summer. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=307.52s)]
*  I'll try not to. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=309.36s)]
*  How about you? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=310.08s)]
*  I usually go to Vermont. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  I go back to Vermont usually. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=313.12s)]
*  I go back to the vineyard. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=314.32s)]
*  No, it's a no-brainer for Houston. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=315.76s)]
*  I think it's great for Durant. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=317.28s)]
*  I was really excited because I want him to have one last act. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=318.64s)]
*  I wanted him to go to the right team. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=322.64s)]
*  I think Miami is a disaster and I really am dubious how much Miami even wanted him or [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=324.24s)]
*  what Miami wants to do in general. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=330.4s)]
*  Because they didn't want to add Hawkeyes legitimately didn't want to put him in a deal [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=332.64s)]
*  after all the other guys they want to put in a deal, then they clearly didn't want him [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=337.2s)]
*  that bad. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=339.92s)]
*  No. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=341.28s)]
*  Like if I, if, if you, if I had a buddy who was [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=341.92s)]

*  I'm like, this dude's it's like a 1973 Ford Bronco. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  He's like giving it away. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=353.44s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=355.04s)]
*  I'm like, but you told me last week, you really wanted a Ford Bronco. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=356.88s)]
*  This guy it's right here. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=360.0s)]
*  This is so I just don't think Miami, I don't think that Miami knows what they want to do. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  We talked about this last week. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  I think they're a mess. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=366.8s)]
*  I don't think they, they have any idea whether they should be trying to pursue and try to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=368.24s)]
*  be good in the playoffs or go the other way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  So Durant didn't happen to give him an extension. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  Just didn't seem like they want to do it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=379.12s)]
*  You're paying a hundred million dollars a year to him and Tyler Hero. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=385.12s)]
*  A year from now. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=385.68s)]
*  Is that a recipe for anything in the East? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=386.72s)]
*  Durant? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=389.12s)]
*  Well, I guess in the East, but this episode is presented by State Farm. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  It's no secret that great teams need great teammates. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=394.72s)]
*  I've been saying this for years. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=397.52000000000004s)]

*  State Farm with the assist coverage options are selected by the customer availability [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=414.96s)]
*  and the eligibility vary by state. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=419.52s)]
*  So anyway, with Houston, the fact that I, what's really interesting to me about this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=422.32s)]
*  is they kept their flexibility for one more trade if they want to do it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=428.48s)]
*  And I don't know whether that trade happens in the summer [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  or whether it happens in the December, January, February range. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=434.88s)]
*  But like, for instance, as we covered many times, Yannis is not getting traded this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  summer, but if it's January and they're 15, the bucks are 15 and 25 and he's like, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=443.6s)]
*  you know what? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=449.44s)]
*  This sucks. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  It's time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=451.68s)]
*  Four bucks fans. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  I have to hear it again. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=453.2s)]
*  They still have their chance. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  If the Celtics changed their mind and they're like, God damn, we didn't realize we'd be [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=455.04s)]
*  this bad and we're going to pay how much money in luxury tax? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=459.68s)]
*  Like, yeah, maybe we will trade Jaylen Brown. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=462.16s)]
*  They have the flexibility still in some of the assets to make a second move, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  which I thought this was going to be their move and this might be move number one. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=469.12s)]
*  So I thought from that standpoint, great. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=473.68s)]
*  And then from a Durant standpoint, I'm excited to see him in playoff games again, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=475.36s)]
*  because I thought it's those teams that he was on basically since that Brooklyn bucks [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  game were not fun teams to watch, you know, and teams that had real, no, no real upside. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  From a Phoenix standpoint, I have no idea what they're doing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=490.32s)]
*  You have to really like that 10th pick. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=494.24s)]
*  You have to feel like you're getting somebody who is going to be potentially like an all MBA guy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=496.16s)]
*  If that's the centerpiece, because we know it's not Jaylen Green and Booker together. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=503.44s)]
*  That's, I can't imagine how those guys are playing together. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=506.8s)]
*  And then you got Bradley Beal next to them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=509.44s)]
*  Like, what is this? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a lot of depth. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=514.8s)]
*  What is this? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=516.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=517.04s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=517.52s)]
*  I have one position. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=518.24s)]
*  I'm worried about your guy. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=519.68s)]
*  I don't know if you want to talk to somebody about all your Booker stock, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=522.4799999999999s)]
*  but you might want to like get rid of some. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=524.88s)]
*  It won't be his fault. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=528.16s)]
*  Diversify the portfolio. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=530.88s)]
*  We're probably going to have to make the call tomorrow, but you know, there's a lot of other [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=531.12s)]
*  factors. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=534.56s)]
*  I like, let's have a Jaylen Green conversation. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=535.76s)]
*  Like right now, what do you think? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  Like, what do you think of them? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=540.2399999999999s)]
*  I want him to go to a bad team and have the ball a lot for like a year. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=541.68s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=547.68s)]
*  I'd love to see him and maybe Phoenix will be the bad team. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=548.96s)]
*  I do feel like there's something there and I think he's young and I think he's had [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=552.0s)]
*  stretches that made both of us go, wow, I thought he got worse last year as the season [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=557.28s)]
*  went along. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=562.08s)]
*  And I thought in the playoffs, they were scared to even have them out there in some [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=562.56s)]
*  of the fourth quarters, but he's still young enough that there might be something there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=567.12s)]
*  I don't, can you run an offense with him as like the creator slash looking out for [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=571.92s)]
*  everybody else? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=576.64s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=577.36s)]
*  Well, you could argue, which is why I'd want to see him on a bad team. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=579.6s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you're saying. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=582.16s)]
*  I mean, his second year, he had almost a 30% usage rate on the team that won 20 games. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=583.2s)]
*  So I don't know that Houston's ever shied away from exactly what you're talking about. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=587.04s)]
*  But I, but an older version of him, to be fair to you, exactly. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=592.64s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=595.84s)]
*  You're saying, okay, fifth year version of him. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=596.48s)]
*  I don't know if that's the recipe because clearly he's going to get his buckets. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=598.64s)]
*  If you give him the shots and when you get drafted as high as he gets drafted, it's a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=601.92s)]
*  bit like a top draft pick in baseball where they almost always will call him up even if [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=606.8s)]
*  they don't know that he deserves a roster spot or the ball pay. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  Like how that ball pace just in the Yankees, even though he's big, big bonuses, you know, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  signing bonus stuff would happen in baseball all the time where you'd be like, why does this guy [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=622.24s)]
*  get called up? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=626.4s)]
*  There's like five other guys in double A that are better than him. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=626.88s)]
*  It's like, well, we didn't spend the resources on them. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=628.64s)]
*  So we have to make sure we know whether we're right or wrong on this guy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=630.7199999999999s)]
*  So I think there's, it's not apples to apples, but there's a close parallel there between [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=634.24s)]
*  Jamie Green being picked this high and going, all right, go to work. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=638.16s)]
*  And I know I've already referenced it before too many times on the pod because we just did it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=641.44s)]
*  But that stretch when Shen Goon was out at the end of the regular season last year was when I [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=645.2s)]
*  thought this light went off for him. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=650.32s)]
*  Two seasons ago. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=652.72s)]
*  But then you go to where he was in the playoffs and you're like, hey, your counters don't work. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=653.28s)]
*  And you can't shoot and we desperately need like the possessions are there for you. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=664.72s)]
*  We don't really love any of our options here. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not like there's two awesome hall of fame scores and you're getting shut out because [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=671.52s)]
*  you're the third option. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=675.28s)]
*  Like we're allowing you to be a one option here offensively, probably a lot longer than [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=676.16s)]
*  anybody else would want to. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  And again, credit to Stone. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=681.04s)]
*  We're in the playoffs and we need you. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=682.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=684.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=685.36s)]
*  And you can't, so, hey, he didn't, he didn't close out a bunch of playoff games this fourth [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  year in that's probably being a little harsh. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=690.64s)]
*  But I think he needs to figure out how to play with somebody else. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=692.96s)]
*  And maybe that's good for him and Booker. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  I, you know, I don't know. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  Or maybe they want nothing to do with it and they're happy to get the pick. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  They're happy to have Brooks to add some kind of toughness because whatever it is Phoenix [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=703.2800000000001s)]
*  is doing is it feels like they're still trying to fix this thing on the fly around Booker, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  which is usually just going to make it worse. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=711.6s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by Mikolob Ultra. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=715.2800000000001s)]
*  One of the best things about summer, all the different sports going on. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSq3U9b7VI&t=718.32s)]
