# “What Happens If …” NBA Playoffs Edition | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ)
*  Here we go, Rob Mahoney. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a game we're calling What Happens If, dot, dot, dot. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1.2s)]
*  So we're going into the future after any of the rounds, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=5.28s)]
*  round one, round two, round three, round four. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=8.48s)]
*  Yeah, how far in the future do you wanna go? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=10.64s)]
*  I wanna go, we'll stop like late June is the end of the future. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=12.72s)]
*  We're just, there's no flying cars yet or anything. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=16.48s)]
*  No, no Kwai with a foot long beard on his deathbed someday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=19.28s)]
*  No, he's like Kwai on the castaway island, nothing like that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=23.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=25.2s)]
*  Well, Kwai is our first one. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=26.64s)]
*  What if Kwai can't pull off being healthy in round one? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=30.0s)]
*  And we do this again and the Clippers lose again. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=33.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=37.2s)]
*  And Kwai plays, it's a six game series and Kwai plays three and a half. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=37.84s)]
*  And there's mystery around it the whole time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=43.28s)]
*  And yet they just extended him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=46.72s)]
*  And there's a new arena coming. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=49.36s)]
*  And the Clippers who had that stretch for two months were like, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=51.2s)]
*  there's three teams that can win the title. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  The Celtics, the Sixers, and the Clippers, the Nuggets are four teams. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=56.08s)]
*  Um, what happens? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=60.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, for one, I think we can't put enough punctuation on the first part of that, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=64.4s)]
*  which is the Clippers lose this series definitively very quickly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=68.0s)]
*  If, if he's not a part of it, he's their only chance to even be competitive [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=71.52s)]
*  against the kind of two way play that the Mavericks have been putting out lately. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=75.04s)]
*  So if Kwai is not healthy, the Clippers lose. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=78.4s)]
*  If the Clippers lose in that fashion and Kwai again has this persistent issue [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=82.64s)]
*  where he can't stay healthy consistently, where he can't really be the centerpiece of a team in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=87.68s)]
*  that way, I think the conversation around him starts to shift and it wouldn't be an indictment [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  of who he can be in big games. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=96.4s)]
*  It's who can he be as a franchise centerpiece? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=97.92s)]
*  Who can he be as a part of the Clippers future? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=100.72000000000001s)]
*  And how do we even conceptualize a player like him if he wants to hang around in that sort of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=103.2s)]
*  situation? If he is the centerpiece of a team that persistently underachieves or doesn't go where [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  it's supposed to go, what does that mean about him? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, and then what do you do if you're Paul George? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  You've already made a shitload of money. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=119.92s)]
*  You live in LA where you're from. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  Notably not extended Paul George. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Not extended Paul George. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Conspicuously not extended. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=124.0s)]
*  You have teams that have crazy cap space, including the Orlando Magic who are really good. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=132.32s)]
*  The Philadelphia 76ers who have Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Or you could stay in the Clippers to get one more paycheck and you're playing with James Harden [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=139.36s)]
*  and broken down Kwai and a bunch of expensive role players. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=144.24s)]
*  Then it comes down to what's important. The Clippers could probably pay a little more, but [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=148.08s)]
*  this is just crazy to me that this is now, we are now in the mid 2020s and we're still doing this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=151.84s)]
*  with Kwai and the Clippers. This is how the decade started. This is how the decade is going. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=157.84s)]
*  And nobody at the Clippers seems to even know if he's a hundred percent. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=162.4s)]
*  And that's where we're starting from too. Like the one thing we didn't unravel there is let's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=167.84s)]
*  say he even stays healthy for the first series. I don't think anyone is thinking of the Clippers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=172.16s)]
*  as a team that could last multiple rounds in the playoffs. And that was the whole premise of this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=176.4s)]
*  group to begin with is this is one of the surest contenders given their talent that you're going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=180.4s)]
*  to find in the field. And they're not anywhere close to that anymore. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. There's this word where OKC could look out. Like the Clippers could somehow beat Dallas [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=187.44s)]
*  in this one. And then, you know, Kwai is on borrowed time at that point with what [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=193.12s)]
*  his health has been. And now OKC might be able to get the Clippers with a compromised Kwai. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=198.72s)]
*  Yep. And then does Kwai drop out of the Olympics at that point? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=204.0s)]
*  Right. Or does he go to Paris anyway and just kind of hang out? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=209.36s)]
*  I don't know. Jalen Brunson goes instead. Jalen Brunson and Joellen Beade hit it off. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=213.28s)]
*  They might need one. All right. We're taping this on a Thursday. So this is still relevant. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=218.48s)]
*  What happens if New Orleans loses the playing game? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=224.88s)]
*  I mean, don't they have an excuse at this point? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=229.2s)]
*  What about the part where Brandon Ingram just got benched in the fourth quarter of a must-win game [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=230.8s)]
*  against the Lakers and the team played better without him? Like, to me, it's. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=237.44s)]
*  I think he's one of the most realistic trade pieces this summer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=243.12s)]
*  For a variety of reasons that include it really feels like it became Zion's team over the last [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  two months. Trey Murphy, how many advanced stats can be incredibly favorable to him at this point? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  Is he like the advanced stats MVP? He's among them. Trey Murphy, beloved, really good player. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=260.0s)]
*  But you said something there that felt like Zion's team over the last few months. I think that's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  definitively true. Watch the Pelicans play over the back part of the regular season. It shifted [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=272.16s)]
*  notably. But it wasn't Zion's team in the last three minutes for the same reason it's not been [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  Zion's team for the majority of his stay there. That's what makes the Ingram question so hard [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  and what makes him especially a less than ideal running mate for Zion just on the grounds that he [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=286.08s)]
*  also gets hurt a lot. And part of the reason he played badly is he's also coming back from an [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=291.28s)]
*  injury. And so whatever you may think about the fit of those guys or what kind of team you could [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  build around them or what their future could be just by the fact that they both cannot stay healthy [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=301.12s)]
*  I think is a huge problem that probably needs to be resolved sooner than later. And they have a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=305.68s)]
*  million picks. So this is hey, Mikhail Bridges. Hey Nets, are you sure you don't want to trade [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=311.04s)]
*  Mikhail Bridges? What if we offered you Ingram and a couple picks and move the year away? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=318.16s)]
*  It could also go the other way. They could win the playing game. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=328.24s)]
*  Without Zion. We'd be like look at Brandon Ingram. What a rejection. On Wednesday he's benched. On [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  Friday he's the hero. Next one. We're bringing in Dame Time. Bringing in my Dame Time bobblehead [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=333.44s)]
*  that I bought for the playoffs on eBay. They had Dame Time the other night and I had to get a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=342.4s)]
*  bobblehead. It's got a little watch on the bottom of it and Dame's looking at his watch in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=348.32s)]
*  bobblehead and kind of nodding at it. What happens if it's not Dame Time in round one? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=354.48s)]
*  What if the clock just never starts moving and Dame Time? I think both you and I feel like this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=360.48s)]
*  might be where we're headed with round one with Milwaukee. But what happens then? Is the market [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=366.48s)]
*  still the same? Do you run it back? Do you say weird year, multiple coaches, Giannis got hurt? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  Or do you say this didn't work? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  I think you get another big Giannis speech about the meaning of failure and success in life. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=383.68s)]
*  Does he have another one? The first one was so well crafted. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=389.52s)]
*  It was quite well crafted. But he's got a little time to workshop it just in case. Just have it [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=393.2s)]
*  prepared in the pocket and ready to go. But I think we are going to hear a lot of the explanation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=397.36s)]
*  Giannis hurt, as you said, multiple coaches. Doc, as he's told us many times, took over mid-season. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=402.16s)]
*  Very difficult thing to do. Hardest thing ever to do is to have a coach that's going to be [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=407.52s)]
*  doing the hard thing. Hardest thing ever to do in the history of sports. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  How could anyone possibly overcome it? Damian Lillard, to be fair, has been going through a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=415.2s)]
*  lot personally and professionally this season. Chris Middleton missed almost 30 games. All those [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=420.0s)]
*  things are completely real and completely valid. And I have to say too, from the time Damian Lillard [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  joined the Bucs, the most likely outcome was they were not going to have enough this season. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=430.32s)]
*  They just lost a lot of their playoff rotation from the year before. They didn't have much of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=436.0s)]
*  a supporting cast. And the guys that they did have, especially Brooke and Chris Middleton, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=440.64s)]
*  are older to the point that their injury risks. So it looked like the kind of team that was going [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=444.64s)]
*  to take not only time to get used to each other, and we've seen that, but time to just get another [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=448.64s)]
*  offseason to get another exception guy. To check another free agent market and get a little bit [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=453.28s)]
*  more help on the edges of their roster, to be honest with you. Because the core four guys are [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=458.64s)]
*  good and they're good together, but they don't have enough right now. And that's really clear [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=463.68s)]
*  when Giannis is out. See, I wonder if their window was 21 when they won the finals and then 22 [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=467.92s)]
*  when they threw away the one seed because they didn't want to play Brooklyn, which was dumb when [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  it was happening. I was on the record at the time. I always won home court. That's why I love what [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=480.88s)]
*  the Knicks did. I just always won home court. You're going to have to play whoever anyway. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  To assume you're just going to be able to duck teams is crazy. They throw it away. Game sevens [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  in Boston. Grant Williams hits 133s. Pickpishard hits some threes. Milwaukee loses. But Milwaukee [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=495.6s)]
*  was really good that year and I think they would have beaten Golden State. But maybe that was their [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  window, that little stretch with the team they had. I thought Middleton looked pretty old in that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=508.88s)]
*  Orlando game. And I know his stats have been okay, but to me, he seems like he shifted to a slightly [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=513.52s)]
*  different point of his career. Their wings are just super slow and the Dame defense piece. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=520.08s)]
*  And there's just a lot of ways to attack them. I don't see it with them. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  Just thinking about all those guys trying to keep up with the screening of the Pacers in transition. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=532.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's step one. Can you even get through that to make that a competitive series and to fight [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=537.2s)]
*  your way through it? And even if you can do that, how are you going to get through multiple series [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=542.0s)]
*  with this roster and with Giannis who plays through injury, he comes back relatively quickly, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=545.84s)]
*  historically speaking. But how could something like a calf injury not be at the back of your mind [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=551.76s)]
*  when you move the way Giannis moves and you run the floor the way he does and your game is predicated [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=556.24s)]
*  on attacking headlong and getting vertical and exploding to the basket on both sides of the ball? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=560.72s)]
*  So I just don't see how that makes sense in terms of a long playoff run. It doesn't really add up to me. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=567.44s)]
*  Rick Carlisle against Doc 2005. It was the Artest Melee year and somehow beat the Celtics [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=573.2s)]
*  in seven and won game seven in Boston. But it's not historically been an awesome matchup. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=582.4000000000001s)]
*  No. What happens if Cleveland flops in round one? I think this one's the easiest one to answer of [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  all the what happens. Well, I think people start losing their jobs or their spots on the team. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=597.12s)]
*  For one, I think. Yeah, I think there's a coaching change. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=603.2s)]
*  JB Bickerstaff, that conversation will be had. To whatever extent Donovan Mitchell has a future [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=606.08s)]
*  as a Cavalier right now, I would think it would change pretty quickly and he would be out sooner [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=611.6s)]
*  than later. And honestly, you probably see a Jared Allen change too, or some clarity as far as their [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=616.48s)]
*  front court. I think it would be the kind of thing where you turn the page from this version of the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=621.44s)]
*  Cavs competing for playoff spots, trying to fight for home court positioning in the playoffs to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  the Darius Garland, Evan Mobley Cavaliers featuring what else you can scrape together. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=630.88s)]
*  That with some shooters and whatever. Yeah, I agree. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=635.2s)]
*  I just think if they lose, and especially if they lose in an embarrassing fashion, and that's [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=638.8s)]
*  what it would be, not because Orlando is bad, but because the way Orlando would beat them would be [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=643.36s)]
*  very reminiscent of how the Cavs lost to the Knicks a year ago. If that happens, there's no [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  delusion where you can talk yourself into the idea that everything's okay. Right? Like the NBA runs [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=653.04s)]
*  on that kind of plausible deniability and people convincing their bosses that they should come back [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=658.8s)]
*  for one more year to try again. But there's no talking anyone into that at that point. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=664.4s)]
*  I, for one, am very excited to watch the Cavaliers next year with Garland, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=669.8399999999999s)]
*  Mobley, Tyler Hero, Jaime Jaquez, Max Struz, and head coach Mike Budenzoller. Sounds great. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. Nicole Jovich, sixth man of the year. I can't wait. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  Nicole Jovich, it looks awesome. Oh, this is a good one. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=686.4s)]
*  What happens if Luca beats the Joker in round two? He just, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  just big boys the series and he's the best player in the series and he knocks Denver out, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  the defending champs. It would have to be the conference finals, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=706.16s)]
*  Yeah. Round three, sorry. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=709.12s)]
*  This is a little reductive and maybe this is my ESPNE FS1E take of the day, but if Luca goes on [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=713.76s)]
*  that kind of run, I think he has a very credible argument to be the best player in the world at [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=720.16s)]
*  that point. Right? There's a baton passing that would happen in that situation given, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=724.32s)]
*  just like looking at the rosters, looking at the matchup, that is a series the Nuggets should win. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=729.28s)]
*  And if they do not, it will be because Luca took it to him and dismantled them and really attacked [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  their team in a way that no one else has been able to do. And so that kind of path to me would signal [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  that Luca is, if not the best player in the world, then at least tied for the best player in the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=746.08s)]
*  world. As the official custodian of the best player alive championship belt, if Luca beats Denver in [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  round three, he's holding the belt up at the end. It might not be fair, but that's just how it goes. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=758.4s)]
*  Man, if that's how you win the championship of whatever, you win the series. And I still think [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=766.16s)]
*  Jokic is the best player in the world, but if Luca outplays him in a series and takes it, then [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=772.64s)]
*  that's it. That's the reality we live in. How do you secure the belt? Do you have it like in a briefcase [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=778.88s)]
*  handcuffed to your wrist at all times? You're just like ready to move it to the next person when [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=783.84s)]
*  necessary? You know the Stanley Cup has a guy that just travels with it. Same thing for us. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=787.84s)]
*  We just have a guy who he's with it. He goes, he brings it around to different parts of the country. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=792.4s)]
*  What a job. This is a good one. What happens if the Knicks beat the Celtics in round three? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=797.44s)]
*  I was trying to think of the highest end, holy shit moment for two fan bases that could happen [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=805.6s)]
*  in the playoffs. And I think this is it. The Knicks, the downtrodden, terrible, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=811.76s)]
*  just laughing stock of the 21st century Knicks getting their shit together, beating Boston, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=819.2s)]
*  which they did in 1973 and they did in 1990. And I think those were the only two times that ever [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=826.8s)]
*  happened. And the Knicks beat the Celtics and go to the finals. That's our highest end, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=834.08s)]
*  holy shit moment that could happen I think in these playoffs, right? Or am I wrong? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=842.08s)]
*  That would be huge. I mean really the Celtics losing at any point before the finals would be [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=845.76s)]
*  a pretty big holy shit moment. I just don't think anyone in the East is really equipped to put up [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  that much of a fight against them at this stage. But I think you have to walk us through this one. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  Your nightmare dreamscape if the Celtics lose to the Knicks. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=859.68s)]
*  What does that look like to you? What does it even happen for that to turn out that way? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=864.4s)]
*  So it's funny. There's no Celtics-Knicks rivalry at all because the Celtics used to just always [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  kill the Knicks, right? Except for a very small window after Russell retired. But Russell, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=874.4s)]
*  I remember when I spent time with him in 2012 and we asked like, what was the Knicks rivalry like? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=879.92s)]
*  He was like, it wasn't a rivalry. We beat them every year. They never beat us ever. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  There was no rivalry. It's like, all right, that's fair. So it was that five-year stretch [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=888.72s)]
*  and that's really it. The 84 East Finals, Bird versus Bernard. That was big. But they were just [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=893.12s)]
*  never good at the same time. If the Knicks beat the Celtics, I would take so much shit from all [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=901.52s)]
*  the New York people in my life. Like my mind goes there because I'm selfish. Yes. You have to block [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=909.9200000000001s)]
*  some numbers, I would think. But I think the craziest thing about it would be that the Knicks [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=914.8s)]
*  did it without doing the all-in crazy trade with all their assets. That would be the nutty part. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=919.04s)]
*  Forget about how weird it would be to make the finals without Randall, but to do it without doing [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=925.8399999999999s)]
*  your all-in Anthony Davis to the Lakers type of trade and still have the picks and the assets. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=930.4799999999999s)]
*  To me, it's like if the Knicks make round three, even if they lose to the Celtics, but they set up [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=936.24s)]
*  this whole foundation, but they still have the assets they have going forward. They've established [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=941.84s)]
*  themselves as, you know, it's cool to play for the Knicks again. This whole era of KD and Kyrie going [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=946.96s)]
*  into New York and not playing for the Knicks, that era is over. So even that's a win, but them [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=953.2800000000001s)]
*  beating the Celtics would be unbelievable. I mean, that would be one of the greatest [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=959.12s)]
*  series in the history of the Knicks franchise. It would have to be. And while we're printing [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=963.12s)]
*  Knicks propaganda here, I mean, even just getting to the conference finals, there's a path there [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=968.08s)]
*  that makes a lot of sense, right? You're matching up with an injured Joel Embiid right out of the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=973.36s)]
*  gate, either an injured Giannis, as we said, or a young Pacers team that's going to be pretty [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=977.12s)]
*  beatable if you're the Knicks, I would think. And before you know it, like Dante DiVincenzo is going [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  wild in the Eastern Conference finals. It can happen very quickly given how good the Knicks are. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=986.0s)]
*  So the fact that they can get there is very impressive. And as you said, if they win, if they [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=990.8000000000001s)]
*  do make it to the finals, that's a banner season. Even if they lose to the Knicks in the conference [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=996.0s)]
*  finals, it makes a great case to the big fish stars you're talking about. If you're Joel Embiid, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1000.64s)]
*  if you're anyone else, the idea of putting a team like New York over the hump, who couldn't quite [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1006.24s)]
*  get past Boston, is going to be very attractive. So long as they can get through those first two [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1010.8s)]
*  rounds relatively unscathed, then that's always a bit of a variable with the Tom Thibodeau team. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1015.6s)]
*  And OG Ananobe is already dinged up as it is. They just got to get through these things relatively [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1020.64s)]
*  healthy. But if they can, they're in a position to really either do something remarkable now or [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1025.04s)]
*  do something even more remarkable later. Yeah. I mean, they were built with the motto of mine [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1030.56s)]
*  was the 04 Pistons. And Brunson is a better scorer than anyone the 04 Pistons had. But same kind of [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1036.96s)]
*  mentality. It's not even close. A tough team that made smart decisions at the end of games and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1044.24s)]
*  was flexible on defense. They don't have the size the Pistons had, but I think [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1050.56s)]
*  the type of players that they went and found, very similar to that team. Like just certain [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1054.32s)]
*  type of warriors who just showed up tough, played really well together, which is I think another [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1059.84s)]
*  thing they have. So it's different, but it's not completely different. Is it blasphemous? Like [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1066.32s)]
*  I think Jalen Brunson right now is better than Chauncey Billups ever was as far as that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1071.2s)]
*  That's a question. Yeah, Chauncey was like a 20 points a game guy. I mean, it was different. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1076.24s)]
*  Like if you put that Pistons team in the way basketball's played now, I think some stats would [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  go up. That was really like the dregs of society or NBA society. Well, maybe society too. There was [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1085.28s)]
*  some 67-64 playoff games. Two more. What happens if Phoenix or Minnesota pick one, lose round one? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1092.88s)]
*  In other words, what loss would have more dramatic changes if you had between those two? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1103.04s)]
*  Phoenix loses in round one. What happens? Minnesota loses in round one. What happens? We talked about [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  not positive towns is back if Minnesota just loses round one. Maybe that's when they play the card. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1115.76s)]
*  Yeah. But what happens to Phoenix if now they're favored and then all of a sudden [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1120.8s)]
*  Minnesota beats them? What do they do? How do you talk yourself into next season? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1124.6399999999999s)]
*  What can you do? You literally can't trade Bradley Beal. You're not going to trade Devin Booker. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1128.64s)]
*  Unless Kevin Durant wants out, you're not trading him. I would hope he wouldn't [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1135.8400000000001s)]
*  so quickly even after something like that. Sadly, you didn't mention the coach yet, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1139.76s)]
*  which is usually after you've listed all the players that are still in the same spot. They're [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1142.96s)]
*  like, the coach. Then all of a sudden the coach is like, wait, I'm fired. Yeah. But an inconsistent [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1147.2s)]
*  execution team with bad fourth quarter performance, that's a lot pointing to Frank Vogel. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1153.68s)]
*  Yeah, that makes it easier. That's the way these things go. That gives you all the cover you need, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  all the reason you need. Is there reason enough to think that this team would be dramatically [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1163.3600000000001s)]
*  different next year? I don't think so. What they need is they still do need, despite all the protests, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1167.2s)]
*  some supplementary ball handling, some playmaking. I think that stuff is meaningful for them even now. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1173.04s)]
*  They need more bench guys they can actually count on versus the kind of roulette wheel that they [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1178.0800000000002s)]
*  spin from night to night. Grayson Allen's been great extending him. I think that's a nice move [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1182.4s)]
*  for them. They had to do that. But they still need more guys that they can actually trust. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1186.72s)]
*  The number of changes they could actually make would be a coaching change and then some supporting [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1192.0s)]
*  cast changes. But the stars would not change in the way that they might for Minnesota. Because I [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1196.88s)]
*  agree with you, if Minnesota loses, it's because they won't have enough offense. If they don't have [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1200.64s)]
*  enough offense, you're looking at your $50 million power forward who's supposed to supply it in a [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1206.88s)]
*  addition to Anthony Edwards, obviously. But you're going to look at him a certain way and wonder, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1212.32s)]
*  is this really the best use of our cap resources when we have so much invested between Go Bear and [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1216.48s)]
*  Cat and Nasri? Something has to give at some point. Yeah. And they've been there before with Cat too. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1220.96s)]
*  So if the series goes badly, it won't be the first time they've kind of looked side-eyed at Cat. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1227.28s)]
*  All right. Bonus question. What happens if James Harden absolutely sucks against Dallas? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1232.08s)]
*  What happens is he sucks and then still gets a gigantic contract. Oh my God. The Quipper fans [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
*  in my life don't want to hear that. I'm sorry. You think he's getting paid either way? I think [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1243.12s)]
*  he's getting paid either way. I think there is a mutual understanding as far as how that stuff will [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1247.04s)]
*  go. And that's where it gets dark. If they lose and James Harden is bad, maybe Paul George leaves. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1252.32s)]
*  And then you're left holding the bag with this team and you're opening up your new building [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1260.56s)]
*  with a starting lineup of Harden and Terrence Mann and Norm Powell and Amir Coffee because [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1264.08s)]
*  Kawhi is sitting out the beginning of the season to nurse back from the injury that ended his [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1268.56s)]
*  previous season and it beats the Zubots. Yikes. Big time yikes. Here's our new arena. Yep. Buy [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1272.24s)]
*  your season tickets today. Yeah. So part of me wonders if they just never made the Harden trade. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1280.56s)]
*  What does this team look like right now? What seed would they have been in? Yeah. I think that would [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1285.52s)]
*  be worse by seeding at least. Yeah. They did win 52 games. They did hit 51. They hit a couple highs. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1291.36s)]
*  Yeah. One of the reasons Dallas versus Phoenix is, I mean, Dallas versus the Quippers is so fun. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1301.12s)]
*  It's also like all these late 2000s, early 2010s draft pick guys. There's a generation of those [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1307.9199999999998s)]
*  dudes, right? Like Kyrie, George, Kawhi, Harden, Westbrook. They're all kind of in this cluster. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1317.2s)]
*  None of them are as good as they were seven years ago, eight years ago, but they're all still pretty [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1325.76s)]
*  relevant and all of them can kind of steal the series, which is another crazy thing. And I include [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1332.32s)]
*  Westbrook in that because if Kawhi gets hurt, I think we're going to see a lot of Russell Westbrook [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  in the series. And he's had a good season. I do think he's the kind of guy that could shift the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1341.76s)]
*  energy of a series like this, but Harden's the one where if Kawhi ends up not playing that much [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1347.36s)]
*  and it's like, Hey James, what do you got? You know, it could be a fucking disaster or he could [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1353.12s)]
*  have a couple of the games like he had last year in the Celtic series where he looks like he's the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1359.36s)]
*  best player on earth for two hours. Yeah. I think it's going to edge, maybe not a fucking disaster, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1363.6s)]
*  but in that direction, he does feel like he's a bit at that stage. And it's similar to what [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1369.44s)]
*  we were talking about with Chris Middleton earlier, where when everyone's healthy, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1374.48s)]
*  a third option, Chris Middleton looks pretty good, but you lose Giannis and you want him to do more [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1378.8s)]
*  and it's just not there. Like the capacity to create in pressure against primary defensive [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1383.52s)]
*  assignments is just not happening for him. That's kind of what I see with Harden. Like he just doesn't [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1388.88s)]
*  get to the basket consistently enough. The foul drawing is obviously winnowed off for him as a [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1392.8s)]
*  result. He has a very either step back or great pass oriented game and he's smart enough and [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1396.88s)]
*  savvy enough to make that work most of the time, but it works primarily when he's a third or fourth [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1402.48s)]
*  option on the floor. Like that's when he's most comfortable at this point. He's told us he wants [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1407.2800000000002s)]
*  to be a facilitator and we probably should take him at his word because that's what he's best at [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1411.6000000000001s)]
*  right now. Well, and especially you're playing the same team for two straight weeks. They start [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1415.3600000000001s)]
*  getting used to stuff. I'll be interested to see how the playoff games are called. There was some [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1419.5200000000002s)]
*  tiny signs that they were loosening up the reins a little bit on some of the foul stuff, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1423.5200000000002s)]
*  but we'll see. Yeah, it's like what happened with Klay Thompson when you talk about Harden. It made [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1428.5600000000002s)]
*  me think of that. Like, it's that different point in your career. We're going to talk about [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1432.96s)]
*  Klay with Logan in a second. We were going to pour one out for the Warriors. I know you talked about [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1437.5200000000002s)]
*  it on the Ringer NBA show, but Rob Mahoney, I think I'm like a nine out of 10 for these playoffs. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1442.16s)]
*  There's so much to love. So many storylines, so many good players. I'm just delighted. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1450.96s)]
*  Even the worst series are going to be either super watchable or they're going to be kind of [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1455.52s)]
*  rock fight endearing. I think there's going to be a lot to watch. There's going to be a lot to dig [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1459.44s)]
*  into. This opening weekend of the playoffs is my favorite sporting event of the year. So I'm looking [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1463.52s)]
*  forward to being in the muck with it. Yeah, the worst series is probably going to be Celtics [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1468.32s)]
*  Chicago or Celtics versus no Jimmy Butler Miami. Then if you go second worst series, I kind of like [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1472.16s)]
*  all the series. Orlando, Cleveland is probably going to get the most NBA TV time. Sorry, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  Suhruity. But I can't wait to watch that series. I can't wait to see some of the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1483.2s)]
*  moves Orlando makes. We'll see what they got. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFS8Sz-aKQ&t=1489.84s)]
