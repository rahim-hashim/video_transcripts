# A Marcus Smart Therapy Session With Brian Barrett and Billâ€™s Dad | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LiDo-SbiOI)
*  My dad is at the point where he probably realizes he's going to live a longer life now that Marcus is on another team.
*  But I think we both really miss him. It's a sad week. I got to say, we talked yesterday on the phone. It was like, man, I can't believe it's over.
*  You know, it's like I can't remember a Celtic trade where I had such mixed feelings.
*  Yeah, I really like Marcus Smart. Seems like a great guy in the community. Does a lot of charity work.
*  But I think we had run the course and this team kind of plateaued. I'm not sure. Watching Denver beat Miami.
*  I don't think this team could ever have beaten my Denver in the finals. So I guess it was time.
*  I kind of wish it was Brogdon, not Smart, but it's the way it worked out.
*  Well, and that was the interesting components of the night, right, Bill?
*  Because you're sitting here and it's Malcolm Brogdon, essentially the first deal for Kristofs Porzingis.
*  And I'm thinking to myself, this is awesome. I wanted them to trade Brogdon.
*  That was the main guy I was looking to move just because I felt like, all right, it's either him or Smart.
*  And I still believe that Smart is the far superior player because even though he had a down defensive season, and maybe we can go through some of that,
*  but he's still a way better defensive player than Brogdon, who at this point is a traffic cone. He can't cover small guards.
*  He can really only thing he can do is like cover up big a little bit.
*  That's why he was like, OK, on Hardin, because Hardin isn't exceptionally fast at this particular point in time.
*  So at that point, emotionally, I'm like, this is awesome. I can't wait to see this.
*  Kristofs Porzingis and all you're giving up is Malcolm Brogdon.
*  And then we find out, OK, it gets shut down.
*  And it's kind of weird from a Clippers perspective because Brad last night is saying at his press conference that he expects Malcolm to be ready to play.
*  Now, whether or not that goes over well based on the fact that he was already traded earlier in the day, we'll see how that turns out.
*  So it's kind of weird from a Clippers angle. But then it's like, oh, now it's Marcus Smart.
*  And you're like, well, now we've got to think about this one a little bit more, right?
*  Because the first one is obviously you do that deal in a second.
*  But now, even though it makes sense from a roster perspective, it's the connection that he had with the fan base and the team.
*  Yeah, well, I just did Chris Vernon's show who's in Memphis.
*  And he said Memphis, they didn't know Smart was on the table till that day.
*  Like that deal materialized really fast.
*  Like when the Brogdon deal fell apart, that was when they moved to Plan B, which was a smart thing.
*  I think they just really wanted Porzingis.
*  And so you start there.
*  I think Brad's liked him since 2017-18.
*  And I think my dad has been to a couple of games where Porzingis just killed us.
*  And that always factors in too when you have a guy who's just come in.
*  There was one game, I think he came into Boston and he killed us.
*  And I think they know the Horford.
*  To me, the Horford thing is more dangerous than the Smart thing because they knew Horford is going to be 38 next year.
*  And just the way they used him last year was not sustainable.
*  I would differ on one thing.
*  I'm interested in my dad's taking this because he was going to the home games.
*  I thought Brogdon was better in the regular season than Smart last year.
*  I actually thought Smart was the third best guard on the team.
*  And I thought they played the best when it was White and Brogdon with Tatum and Brown and a big.
*  And like the five-man unit numbers kind of back it up.
*  Like that was the case most of the year.
*  And I wish they did that more.
*  They didn't dial into that lineup enough.
*  It's a good point.
*  There were some really interesting articles and snippets in the Globe today about Joe Mazula and how Smart was the voice of the team.
*  And we noticed it at the games.
*  Sometimes Smart would control the huddle when they took a timeout.
*  Yeah, my dad would text me.
*  He's like, Smart's kind of coaching the team during this timeout.
*  I'm like, what?
*  He did it during the playoffs too.
*  Yeah.
*  And maybe Joe Mazula could never really have controlled this team with Marcus Smart still as the voice of the Celtics.
*  The other thing, and you mentioned it to me yesterday, Bill, and I think it was a really good point.
*  I think they want Tatum and Brown to be more forceful leaders in the locker room and with the team.
*  And maybe that never was going to happen with Marcus there.
*  Maybe they just wouldn't have elevated their leadership skills.
*  I think that's the number one reason they made the trade.
*  And Perkins was on get up.
*  Now, Perkins is a wild card at all times, but he's about as connected as anybody who's going to be on ESPN about the Celtics.
*  And he thought the trade was a mistake.
*  No surprise.
*  I can't believe the Celtics did this.
*  You can't trade Marcus Smart.
*  Like, whatever.
*  We knew that take was coming.
*  But he said this was about Joe Mazula and Marcus Smart and and Marcus Smart didn't get along with Joe Mazula or Joe.
*  Joe Mazula was threatened by I forget how he put it, but that was what I've heard over the last two days.
*  Like, I think I think Marcus has been was on the team for nine years and felt like it was his team.
*  You know, and it was him and Tatum and Brown.
*  It was the big three.
*  And he had an outsized voice in the locker room on the court.
*  I think it was really tough to bench him.
*  When did we start talking about?
*  You start talking about it on your pod and I start talking about mine in February.
*  That Nick Sunday night game was really illuminating when they had to bench weight with four minutes to go.
*  And we're like, how how in God's name are they playing smart overweight in the last four minutes of this game?
*  Weight has been awesome.
*  What are we doing?
*  And I think they were afraid to bench smart.
*  And I think it became a real thing where it was like he was being treated like he was Tatum or Brown.
*  And meanwhile, White was a better guard the whole year unquestionably.
*  So maybe that was a piece of it, Brian.
*  I just feel like, you know, it's like, yeah, this is awkward.
*  Maybe we got to just fix this.
*  But you just mentioned something else.
*  I thought I went to so many games.
*  Brogdon was terrific all season.
*  Everybody is just remembering how he was hurt in the playoffs.
*  Yeah, it's unfair.
*  It's unfair.
*  He was six man of the year.
*  There are a number of games where he rescued us.
*  And again, he's not a point guard.
*  He's a shooting guard.
*  So he shouldn't have been guarding fast point guards.
*  And that's that's something they're going to have to take care of if he comes back healthy.
*  I mean, this this short a point guard.
*  Everybody's wondering if Pritchett can take that role.
*  I have questions about that.
*  I think they're going to have to make a move.
*  Brian, just so you know, my dad has switched his take on Pritchett.
*  I looked it up yesterday.
*  74 times he's like this guy's a total asset to this guy's a bum.
*  We've got to trade him.
*  He's never where are we right now on Pritchett, Dad?
*  No, I had a friend that texted me yesterday and said, do you think Pritchett could play playing 10 minutes a game?
*  And I responded, maybe nine.
*  I mean, that's how I'm not sure about him coming in.
*  He was a turnstile in defense.
*  He's horrible. He's horrible on defense.
*  It's not even his fault, right?
*  Because it's like in the playoffs, Jimmy Butler and I still have no idea why Missoula decided to play Pritchett in Game 1 against Miami.
*  It was idiot.
*  It wasn't just like, let's try this in the first half.
*  He's like, we're running it back in the second half.
*  That was an abomination.
*  Jimmy Butler's like, wait, hold on.
*  Are you guys really going to put him out there?
*  He's really going to be on the court.
*  You're telling me I can just target him.
*  It was just unbelievable.
*  I can't believe he did that.
*  But I would say how about the Washington thing now where they're going to continue to sell off players?
*  Monty Morris of the Celtics can get a deal for him.
*  They're certainly they have a gluttony of point guards right now.
*  So maybe that's somebody that they could look at.
*  But in terms of the smart thing, I think they need a wing unless this unless my guy Jordan Walsh can actually play next year.
*  They were the Gallo injury was kind of the sneaky piece of the season because they were either they just had two types of lineups.
*  But any time Tatum or Brown got in a foul trouble, you were just like, oh, no.
*  Like, what are we going to do?
*  You know?
*  Yeah. And that's why I look at two.
*  They needed to add somebody on the wing line.
*  I think they wanted OMAX Prosper at 25.
*  Right.
*  And then Dallas jumps into 24.
*  They take them.
*  They take them.
*  And if you look at Walsh, it's a very similar profile where he's six, seven, seven, two wingspan, which is the guy's a freak athlete, McDonald's All-American, all that.
*  The only issue is twenty seven point eight percent from three point territory.
*  So Brad did say at the press conference last night that he hopes that there's not a lot of pressure on him.
*  You're one like they're not expecting big things.
*  But unless they do add a wing, it does feel like they're going to need to find some wing minutes.
*  And it is sort of weird that this team where their two best players were wings, Jalen Brown and Jason Tatum, they had no wings after that.
*  Right. We talk about the best wing combination in the league.
*  So I would say they need to add a wing.
*  I agree with you on that, Bill.
*  The question I would have and look, they save some money so they can get to that five million dollar exception.
*  I just don't know who the wing is that's going to be out there unless it's another trade.
*  Well, remember, they they had high hopes for how's of being that backup wing and the first 40 the first 40 games of the year.
*  He was terrific. And then Joe buried him.
*  And and we never saw him in the playoffs in meaningful minutes.
*  I'm not sure if he can do it, but I mean, he shot very well the first half of the year and his defense was better than people talked about.
*  Yeah, the teams targeted has are all year and he held his own a lot.
*  It was pretty funny. Every time anybody saw him, they would get super excited about it.
*  Listen, with the Missoula piece of this, it really feels like they've doubled down on him in a bunch of different ways.
*  Right. From the end of the season, they were like, you know what?
*  He did an amazing job. There was that quote from Danny Ainge about he's a better head coach than he made.
*  Whatever he said, I was like, whoa, what was that?
*  What's your theory on that, by the way, Bill? Why do you think he said that?
*  You think he's upset, like sort of what he may did with the Celtics organization?
*  Obviously, he still has friends here. Or do you think it's more like just being like, well, Will Hardy was really the guy that was behind email last year.
*  And that's now my coach. You think that was the reason he made that comment?
*  I think that was how I interpreted it, was that his coaching staff was really good during that one year.
*  And it was almost like, are we sure he made a good coach? Did you have a sarcastic joke, Dad?
*  A Danny Ainge backhanded compliment.
*  Right.
*  We saw that. Yeah.
*  Yeah, he would do that a lot. But the thing with Joe, like, so the narrative from the moment the season ended was we're not firing him.
*  He deserves a full year. They didn't say this publicly, but they did him a massive disservice with the coaching staff he had, like even not even scrambling during the season and trying to get David Fisdale, anybody who's been a head coach before.
*  And then they go and hire Cassel, they hire Charles Lee, and they trade Marcus.
*  And if you're going to say, like, Missoula goes in his exit interview and they're like, hey, if we could trade two guys, what would be your top two draft picks?
*  I would have said or let two guys go. Dad, I would have said Smart and Grant Williams, right?
*  Like, he seemed like he had a really complicated relationship with Grant Williams.
*  I think when Smart took over the huddle each time and probably said to Joe, second hand, second row Joe, Joe, just get back there.
*  I mean, I think there's a real aspect to Smart never really respecting Missoula.
*  Well, didn't you tell me you were at a game when Smart just checked himself in?
*  Yeah, just all of a sudden without any prompt from the coaching staff.
*  And Joe kind of turned around like, wait, what's going on? And Smart was just going into the game.
*  Yeah, that was a real thing that happened.
*  He checked himself in like as if he was Kobe Bryant. I'm going back into the game.
*  I think it happened more than once, right?
*  Well, that was the big thing about Smart.
*  I mean, we had so many great moments and so many other moments where we'd say no, no, no, yes.
*  But he obviously thought he was much better than he really was over the course of the years.
*  And that was never going to change.
*  That's what I said to Verno. His best quality is his worst quality.
*  He thinks he's one of the best 25 players in the league. He does.
*  And that's great. He has the confidence.
*  How many times did the ball always find him in the last 30 seconds of a game?
*  Always. It always. And he was never afraid of the moment.
*  He never passed up a shot and he always tried to make a play.
*  Did he ever make that shot?
*  Yeah, a few times.
*  Oh, really? I can't remember any.
*  No, come on, Dad.
*  He made it late, remember, against the Philadelphia 76ers. When Tatum kicked it out to him, he made it late.
*  But circling back to what you said, Bill, about Perk and the fact on Verno's show that they didn't know that Marcus Smart was available.
*  I think part of it, too, what Perk was saying is that he did grow six inches in the offseason.
*  So that was part of the calculus there, too.
*  Right.
*  He said about the Manga. He actually believed the guy grew six inches.
*  A grown man grew six inches. But anyway, I can't believe he fell for that.
*  But anyway, I digress. The point that I was trying to make about Smart is just you now take that club out of the bag, Bill, to your point about the closing the games.
*  Because out of those three, I mentioned this the other day, Brogdon, Smart and White.
*  White was third in fourth quarter minutes out of those guys in terms of minutes per game.
*  We were going nuts the whole year about it. It was ridiculous.
*  So I think this accomplishes two things. First of all, you turn the team over in terms of the point guard position.
*  Now Derek White is the point guard. And I get it. He's not really a traditional point guard, but he can certainly play that position.
*  And Tatum has improved as a playmaker as well. So Tatum, we saw in the postseason how many times like the balls in his hands, he's handling it.
*  So you have Derek White to be that guy.
*  And then the other thing that Brad basically was mentioning last night is to paraphrase what he's saying, they needed to make the roster make more sense, right?
*  They needed to turn it over a little bit because they had that logjamic guard.
*  And an interesting thing that Brad mentioned last night about Porzingis, he actually brought up the post ups.
*  Brad, like he was not forced. He wasn't asked about post ups. He brought it up.
*  And he said, yeah, it brings a new wrinkle, essentially, to paraphrase what he was saying.
*  And we've run through a KOC, had the numbers too, where last year he was in the 89th percentile as a postscorer.
*  He was phenomenal, right? And I start to think back to what transpired in the postseason.
*  How many times did we say the offense is stuck in the mud? This even goes back to the previous-
*  Which postseason? You could say the last four postseasons.
*  Yeah, and it keeps happening to this team. And now all of a sudden you have this guy that is an elite post player.
*  His catch and shoot numbers on threes, his numbers on threes in general are great as well.
*  I'm awfully excited about this Porzingis thing. And I don't think that this is a crazy take to say.
*  I can imagine a world next season where Porzingis is actually the second best Celtic because Jalen is a great player and all that.
*  But he never shows up in the Impact Metrics, right? He never plays well when Tatum's off the court.
*  And I get it. He hits big shots in the-
*  It's a hot take. I like it.
*  Well, he hits big shots in the postseason. But if you look at Porzingis, the Wizards with him on the court this past season, they were absolutely phenomenal.
*  And I just think that it's a different thing that the Celtics, when's the last time they had this type of player, right?
*  It's always been the same type of offense. And Joe, they almost doubled down at it, right?
*  They were second in terms of second to last in the NBA in terms of their percentage of shots that came from two points territory.
*  And that's what was so aggravating about the Miami series. Miami's bad defending the two. Atrocious against defending the two.
*  And the Celtics couldn't expose that.
*  And had no room protection.
*  Whatsoever.
*  Yeah, they had bam and that's it.
*  Yeah, but it just felt like this is a team that, hey, they had a fastball.
*  And when their fastball was on, like it's a reliever coming out of the bullpen, you can't hit him.
*  But if he doesn't have his fastball, okay, maybe you get to him. And if he doesn't have a curveball, he doesn't have a change up.
*  I do feel like Porzingis sort of provides that change up. And the other thing is he's coming off his best season.
*  And he's 27. I'm with you. I really like the trade. And for all the reasons you said, Dad, I think you're really going to like Porzingis.
*  I don't. I think probably haven't watched him a ton.
*  Some people have criticized the only played 65 games, but they forget that Washington was tanking and they held them out of the last six games.
*  So it could have played only one games. I'm really looking forward to it.
*  But the reality is they could not bring back that same team. That that team could not get over the hump.
*  And I wasn't looking forward to watching that same three point offense with no play inside.
*  I thought one of the best three players I saw in person all season was Porzingis.
*  So I mean, he was inside outside. I think 18 of 15 of his 18 shots were inside, not three point or something like that.
*  I'm looking forward to it. I think we needed a change.
*  And the we left that game seven that I unfortunately flew back for one of the things is anybody take a picture of you at that game?
*  Yes, we became the sad Bill Simmons beam.
*  We didn't we felt like one of the flaws with last year's team was that they actually didn't unleash white enough.
*  I thought White was really good in pick and rolls.
*  And when they would initiate the offense through him, there was a little stretch in the third quarter where he just started attacking the basket.
*  And you could tell Miami was like, oh, shit, they figured out this is we're not we're not going to stop in this.
*  So to me, the smart trade is about giving Missoula more space and room unleashing white officially,
*  because I really do genuinely think there was some white smart stuff last year, not from White's side.
*  But I think smart was really threatened by White's impact on the team, how good he was,
*  the discourse about why isn't White playing in the fourth quarter like these were all day to day narratives.
*  And when they switch to the bigger lineup, I thought it was not great that, you know,
*  Marcus, I think maybe one other person was saying, like, finally, we're back to the big lineup.
*  And it was kind of a shot at White. And it was like, what's our third best player?
*  Why are you taking shots at that guy? Well, think about the possible size of our starting lineup.
*  White and Brown at the guards for Zingas, Williams and Tatum in the back line.
*  That's a huge. And then and then think about this.
*  And this is Jackie McMullen ruined this for me in like February.
*  She was like, sorry to paraphrase you, Jackie, but she was basically like Brown and Brown and Smart.
*  They're too sloppy. The first quarter, like we can't get through the first quarter without they have like three turnovers combined.
*  Like, just watch for it. The first three minutes of the game, one of them will have like the worst turnover of all time.
*  So I started watching and I was like, man, like I and then you start fixating on the Jaylen turnover specifically.
*  But both of those guys are so sloppy with the ball.
*  That's another thing I'm kind of looking forward to is maybe not as many dumb turnovers.
*  Well, also, they're not going to be able to double team Jaylen when Porzingis is out there.
*  So maybe they'll open lanes dribbling.
*  And there's a white Porzingis pick and roll piece of this that I think could be really fun.
*  And, you know, they also I think they're going to spend on the mid level, you know,
*  And that's where you can get some of those Marcus minutes back in the same kind of like energy, you know, dirt.
*  I don't know if Bruce Brown, he's probably too expensive.
*  You know, all the second round picks Brad was accumulating last night,
*  there was something on the Internet about packaging Grant Williams and the four second round picks he accumulated for something.
*  If they do a sign of trade. When you say the Internet like the dark web, like where were you?
*  What part of the Internet were you?
*  I was I was exploring.
*  Well, I do think the grant sign and trade, which they can't do till July 1st.
*  But, you know, the worst case scenario that is it's a grant sign and trade.
*  They get back like a waivable contract or a trade exception or however it goes.
*  No more trade exceptions.
*  My dad hates trade exceptions.
*  It's good. We call it the Evan Fournier shit special.
*  We use them.
*  We use it for Evan Fournier who got COVID like as the trade was being finalized.
*  But I do the grant piece is something to watch with this team.
*  Can they turn that into something like what if they trade into Dallas to get prosper back, you know, something like that?
*  And then are they going to spend for a mid-level guy?
*  And Dallas just got the TPE not to bring that back up, but they got a TPE.
*  I think it's 17 million dollars and Grant, we know.
*  No, but they use that for didn't they use that for homes?
*  I thought they used that for homes with 24.
*  Yeah, they still have their mid-level now though because they moved under the under the tax.
*  So yeah, I mean, we should talk about Jordan Walsh for a second because.
*  Jordan Walsh who you love and nobody else ever heard of?
*  First of all, not true.
*  He fits the Celtics.
*  The Celtics and the Warriors are the two teams that love to do this.
*  Can I just say your favorite player two years ago was Thibault because he can play defense.
*  Still on Thibault.
*  Still on on him.
*  Listen, I was actually happy when he got traded from the Sixers because he was one guy that actually defended Tatum really well.
*  I totally agree with you.
*  And they took him off the court all the time.
*  I'm like Doc doesn't play this guy.
*  And then they got McDaniels and they weren't really playing him and McDaniels can't cover Tatum.
*  So I never understood that to begin with.
*  Yeah, that was weird.
*  Starting with Walsh though, and this goes back to Celtics.
*  This is Celtics Warriors thing.
*  Fourteen months ago, he was the number 10 recruit heading into college basketball.
*  Brandon Miller was number nine.
*  The if you look at the list, like the top five guys, like the guy Dallas ended up taking, I think was one or two.
*  But Walsh was like he was like a five star kickass recruit.
*  He goes to this Arkansas team and they have a ton of shooting and and you know, it's like they're going to run play for him.
*  So he became like the kind of the Marcus Smart slash whoever of that team.
*  Like he did all the dirty work.
*  He jumped off the TV for me in the tournament.
*  And the only reason I remember this is because I was watching them.
*  They beat the one seed in the second round game.
*  And I was like, who the hell is this guy?
*  I love this guy and did the research.
*  I was like, Jesus, he was the tenth guy in the.
*  So anyway, he fell to thirty nine because of the shooting and, you know, but to me, he has a specific skill that this team needs.
*  And maybe he won't play next year, but you get that guy thirty nine.
*  You can groom him in a year from now.
*  I think you're going to like that guy, Dad.
*  He's a maniac. He is like a dives into WIC and his family going for a loose ball kind of guy.
*  Like he's an absolute maniac.
*  So I'm in.
*  Yeah. And the other thing I like about that is they traded down a couple of times so they could basically get up there in terms of what they can spend in terms of the salary cap space, the five million dollars.
*  But the other component is I look at the two teams that made it to the Western Conference Finals.
*  Austin Reeves, that was cheap labor last season.
*  Now, obviously, he's going to get really expensive. Right.
*  And I'm not saying obviously Walsh doesn't profile to be a guy on the ball, but he can provide you if everything turns out like it was at the collegiate level, elite level athleticism.
*  And an elite level defender on the wing line, which is obviously like top line.
*  Unbelievable. His his arms.
*  I mean, they go down to his knees.
*  There are seven at least seven to wingspan.
*  It's ridiculous. Right.
*  And the phenomenal athlete.
*  Yeah. The other guy I think of is Christian Brown, of course, for the Nuggets, who look, that guy is obviously going to get better as his career goes on.
*  But he provided them big time minutes in the finals.
*  And the thing about those teams is obviously the Lakers are really expensive.
*  The Nuggets are getting expensive now as they get their contracts kicking in.
*  And this same thing is going to happen to the Celtics.
*  Right. Because this offseason, it already happened because grant was their cheap guy and he was about to become expensive.
*  So you're totally right.
*  They need a cheap guys.
*  Yeah. And think about it, too, because now Jalen gets the two ninety five and then Tatum's going to get the contract north of three hundred million dollars.
*  You need to hit on some of these guys.
*  It's almost like in the NFL.
*  Right. Where we talk about, hey, if you can get a receiver in the first round and you have a very little or small cap at the Jamar chases of the world.
*  All that. All those guys that have had Justin Jefferson, Debo Samuel for the Niners.
*  If you can get one of those guys to hit, even if he's not a star level player like Brown's not a star.
*  I mean, obviously Reeves is a really good player, but Brown's not a star.
*  But if they can just contribute to winning basketball.
*  And that's why I think you look at the trend like Jack Jones, like getting Jack Jones in the fourth round, some pitch, shut down cornerback, assuming he's not going to be in jail.
*  But yeah, I'm with you.
*  So I really I'm optimistic and I like the profile because you look at the guys, they skipped on there.
*  Right. I really like the sense of our kid from Ohio State because he was a bucket getter and I liked Colby Jones as well.
*  But then you looked at the player they got.
*  You could see they were definitely going for a certain type.
*  And Brad even said that, like at the press conference, he said we had a couple of guys in mind.
*  So obviously what I said, that's your theory is right.
*  So they're waiting for Prosper at twenty five and Walsh was like choice B.
*  Yeah. So if Prosper wasn't there, I believe they were going to take Walsh and it fits the type of player that they were looking at.
*  Like they had one specific thing it feels like they were looking for in the draft and they end up with Walsh.
*  And I really like the pick.
*  But Brian, that this is over and over again.
*  This is the one thing I've been pretty good with the draft with guessing guys over the years.
*  It's like I just want to have an elite skill.
*  Right. Once you get past like 20, I remember Nick Claxton one year.
*  He was like my favorite guy late round.
*  I remember what we didn't take him and I was like, oh, man, like that's I know what that guy is.
*  He's an energy guy with long arms.
*  He's around the rim and that's who he is.
*  This is what Walsh is. Walsh.
*  We know what he is. He's he's going to be high energy defense.
*  Thighball is another one I loved.
*  I still feel I'm still buying.
*  Sell me your Thighball stock.
*  I'm still I'm still in.
*  I'm still I think just bad situations for him.
*  And same thing for like a shooter, like somebody like Reeves.
*  Just knows how to score like he's not like a three point shooter.
*  He's a you know, he gets to the foul line and does different things.
*  So I think that was the case for Prichard, too, that they felt like he was that the Celtics didn't take his teammate in Arkansas, Nick Jones.
*  It was sitting there at 25.
*  Well, the guy I don't think they Celtics mess with clutch because I don't think much like the Celtics.
*  He was a clutch guy.
*  Yeah, he's a clutch guy.
*  I heard last night they were saying and saying on the draft coverage, which that's a whole different story, but they say it was awful.
*  It was terrible.
*  They were saying that Rich Paul was calling got teams in the second round about one of his guys like don't draft them.
*  It was a guy who ended up, I think, going 58 to Milwaukee.
*  Wait, can we pivot back to can we pivot back to Marcus for a second?
*  Yeah.
*  What? So it's been split in Boston, right?
*  For the most part, half of the people are like, I can't believe mostly the younger fans, right?
*  Who like grew up with Marcus who this was their first dramatic Celtics trade basically.
*  And then the older fans are like, yeah, it's maybe it was time for him to go nine years.
*  And you're right.
*  A lot of the younger fans.
*  Yeah, a lot of the older fans are fine with it because they look at him as a turnover prone player and he's been here since 2014.
*  Right. I mean, so he's been here forever.
*  We've seen him for a long period of time.
*  I like Marcus as a player, but I can totally understand the aggravation that people have with him.
*  When he turns the ball over, when he takes those threes and all that.
*  But the one thing I will say that in the people that are really upset about this trade and really upset that Marcus Smart has moved on, I feel like it's gone over the top.
*  Like they didn't trade Paul Pierce or Larry Bird.
*  Right. This is Marcus Smart. It's not Tatum or Jalen Brown.
*  Right. So I felt like the people that were upset about Marcus Smart, I didn't realize, Bill, and maybe I was maybe just dumb.
*  I didn't realize it.
*  I didn't understand the attachment that everybody had to Smart.
*  I haven't seen it.
*  You know what it was?
*  It was because whatever we think the Celtics mean as a franchise, 78 years, however long it's been, and all the titles and the history and Tommy Hines and the Tommy points and the legacy of the team.
*  He really got that and understood it and embraced it and threw himself into it.
*  And I just thought he was an awesome Celtic and he was great in the community.
*  I loved how we talked about his story as a kid growing up, how tough his life was and how he wanted to be a role model.
*  And I think he genuinely loved being on the team.
*  I think in his head, he basically said this.
*  He wanted to spend his whole career here and probably be Brian Scalabrini after he retired and start doing TV and stuff.
*  So I think that was all parts of it.
*  We haven't had a lot of guys like it's this weird thing.
*  Dad, I don't know where he ranks for you with the all time role players like Parrish was better like Parrish was an all star.
*  He was a lottery pick.
*  But on that next level of like smart was like better than ML Carr and guys like that.
*  Oh, yeah, definitely better than Posey and guys like that.
*  But he wasn't quite on the Maxwell Parrish level either.
*  He's in this weird like maybe like Satch Sanders.
*  I don't know. He's in this weird place.
*  Historically, he just asked me the key question.
*  Where did he rank as a role player?
*  Marcus didn't see himself as a role player.
*  Yeah, Marcus Marcus or himself is one of the big three.
*  And and that's always going to that was always going to be a problem, I think, with the new coach.
*  Well, and when Derek White is playing better than him.
*  So I guess that the way this trade comes back to haunt them, Brian, is if it turns out smart was just banged up last year.
*  He definitely was had a bunch of injuries.
*  He had the ankle thing.
*  It didn't look like he was in the same conditioning that he had the year before,
*  because I think he was just banged up and couldn't stay in shape in the same way.
*  But he just like to step slow to me last year.
*  And if he comes back next year and has the Rocky for living in a log cabin in Russia summer and is in the best shape of his life,
*  I could see him being awesome on Memphis.
*  And the question for me and I think all the Celtic fans is, are you going to be happy for him if he's awesome next year?
*  I'll be happy for him. I don't care.
*  Yeah, trade's a trade. It happened.
*  To me, I'm not spiteful on this one. This is like I hope he's awesome on Memphis.
*  I hope he has a great second stage of his career.
*  There's been other guys we've traded where I'm like, I hope that guy fucking sucks.
*  Fuck that guy.
*  Don't you think, Bill, a lot of it's going to depend on if Porzingis plays the whole year?
*  If Porzingis goes down sometime during the year and misses 20 games, we're going to hear a lot about this trade.
*  Well, and I think the one other thing is what if and look, I'm the president of the Derek White fan club.
*  Bill, you've been to a couple of meetings on Wednesday nights. We meet every Wednesday.
*  It's great. I always bring the cheese.
*  Yeah. My one concern is and I'm not betting on this happening, but what if it's like, oh, the 38 percent he shot from three, that was one year.
*  He's back down to 35 percent below league average.
*  What if he can't handle all the playmaking duties?
*  Now, my bet is he. No, I'm saying that.
*  I don't think that's happening either. To be abundantly clear, I don't think that's happening either.
*  But that would be the one other thing that we look at and say, oh, trading smart.
*  You made this bet on Derek White. I don't think that's going to happen.
*  But that would that would be my one other question.
*  I had a friend who works for another team when White was kicking ass on the playoffs.
*  And he was like, God damn it.
*  I thought you guys are going to be dumb enough to trade White this summer.
*  Now you're not going to trade him.
*  I think around the league, he's held in really high esteem, like all the advanced metrics absolutely love him.
*  He's an awesome guy. He doesn't need the ball that much.
*  He doesn't make mistakes. He's an incredible defender.
*  I mean, ironically, Marcus won Defensive Player of the Year.
*  And I thought White was I think I voted for him for.
*  Well, he made second team. I might have voted for him.
*  First team on all defense, because I just couldn't believe like his shot blocking, how comfortable he was breaking up two on ones.
*  There was really nobody in the league he couldn't guard.
*  He's it's weird. He's like crafty guys like don't know what to do with them when they get near the rim.
*  And the other thing he's so great at is and maybe this is hyperbolic, but he's the best guy to me.
*  And I watch every game he plays and I watch a lot of the other other players in the league as well.
*  But I've never seen a guy that's better getting around screens like you cannot screen him off.
*  Somehow, especially off the ball, like Jalen will always get caught up on those screens.
*  He finds a way to get around him.
*  Well, so the combo of they trade smart, they open that runway for him.
*  And then the Derek White game and that iconic steal, which isn't as iconic because we lost by 20 in Game 7.
*  But still was an awesome moment. But look, Tatum Brown.
*  White is the third best guy in Porzingis is your fourth best guy.
*  Average 24 points a game last year.
*  I think he's going to be higher up than that.
*  Well, yeah, but whatever ranking you want to go, if White's the fourth best guy in this team, who has a better fourth guy in their team than White?
*  You go around the league, it's like like Michael Porter Jr.
*  The league's not built that way.
*  Who is a better fourth player than Jalen Brown on the Supermax, you know?
*  I can't trouble with this left hand. No, I'm kidding.
*  He'll be the third best player.
*  What if he what if he does the Pete Maravich dribbling drills this summer?
*  Hey, that's what Wemba Yana learned from that.
*  And I heard your pod with Winnhorst.
*  Yeah, Winnhorst said how Wemba Yama was doing the Pete Maravich dribbling drills, these videos from the 70s.
*  So can we send the whole collection to Jalen Brown?
*  He should go hang out with Sam Cassell for the summer and just have Sam Cassell work on ball handling drills with him.
*  I was watching those videos that surfaced last year on the Internet when he was working with Harden.
*  He's just like screaming at Harden at one point.
*  This is like the perfect guy for Jalen.
*  Brian, Brian, I think you just raised a really good point.
*  It's going to be a much better coaching staff.
*  It's going to be more diverse.
*  They're going to have it.
*  It can't be worse.
*  It can't be worse.
*  You know, they they put in that big, big guy from Duke to, oh, Emil Jefferson.
*  Yeah. To play around with the bigs.
*  Sam Cassell was a terrific defensive player for us, and he could dribble.
*  And I hope you're right.
*  The change in coaching staff allows them to work individually with some of these guys.
*  This is how I know my dad's getting old because when Sam Cassell was on the 08 Celtics and Doc would throw him in every once in a while, you used to go nuts.
*  We're like, why is this guy playing?
*  He's my age.
*  No, but I didn't want him to shoot.
*  That's all.
*  Yeah, I wanted it to be a point guard.
*  Well, here's another thing with the with the trade and just in general this next week.
*  Are you scared anybody in the East?
*  Like it seems like Philly is going to bring Harden back unless Miami can pull off the Dame thing.
*  Everybody on that team is a year older and they have a lot of free agents coming up like Struz is a free agent, Gabe Vincent.
*  What's going to happen with that team?
*  Milwaukee Middleton opted out.
*  Are they going to sign him back for a ton of money?
*  Lopez might leave.
*  Lopez is going to be one of the big free agents.
*  So you look at the East and you go like, who are we supposed to be like completely afraid of?
*  I don't have anybody.
*  No, I'm with you on that.
*  The only thing is to your point, Dame, because they lost to the Miami Heat without Damien Lillard.
*  Right.
*  And I know that Tyler Hero like people can argue they were better without him, but they didn't even have that card to play when the Celtics won those three games.
*  Right.
*  When they needed offense, they couldn't even play that card.
*  And obviously Lillard is significantly better player than Hero.
*  But the other thing about Kasell is you bring in Charles Lee as well and coach and waiting potentially to.
*  Well, that's that's my point is like, OK, so if you look at it, these guys are obviously motivated to work hard because if the Celtics get over the hump, they're going to get the credit, not Joe Sam Kasell and Charles Lee will.
*  And they're going to get head coaching opportunities.
*  And Lee was just the finalist for two jobs.
*  But the other portion of this is if Joe isn't more pliable, to use the Tom Brady word with what he's doing offensively.
*  And if players are getting sort of aggravated with Joe next season, well, then you have two guys on the bench that could take over the team.
*  I know that would be the last thing that the organization would want to do to move on after Joe.
*  But if it presents itself and it has to happen, you have now two really capable guys of doing that.
*  So I think there is a pressure on Joe.
*  And obviously, there's pressure on the organization in general.
*  But these guys, this is almost to this point, a really, really good offseason for Brad to establish assistance.
*  You bring in a guy like Porzingis, who I really like to trade, Brad Belichick last night trading down like crazy.
*  And I give him a lot of credit for trading Marcus, right?
*  Like that's he knows that he's going to be criticized locally at some point, even if it's the right move.
*  A lot of people are going to support the decision.
*  But all these other moves that he's made have worked out to like I continue to be Andy found email, right?
*  I continue to be amazed at Brad's work as a GM because I always felt like it kind of feels weird that he's getting the job right?
*  Like he's just getting the GM job with no experience whatsoever.
*  But it turns out like he's the white trade was outstanding.
*  The Brogdon trade was outstanding.
*  The moving canvas contract and people thought Al was just in the deal.
*  Al was really good for them.
*  And I know he's older now, but he was really good for them for a number of years.
*  Like Brad's been really good when it comes to this stuff.
*  I agree.
*  Well, the thing with Joe, now that we have some distance, it's pretty it was pretty rough.
*  I mean, the fact that they've doubled down on him, I was talking to somebody the other day about the first two Miami games, which is when they really lost the series.
*  Those games were an atrocity from a coaching standpoint.
*  Like they were an atrocity.
*  I never want to watch them again because it'll really like ruin my week.
*  That game one with the weird lineups and playing Pritchard, he didn't play grand at all.
*  Right. Our first home game, they blow that one.
*  The second game, we're up nine and we blow the lead the last six minutes because the offense completely dies.
*  And they lost the series in those two games like it to beat that Miami team four straight times with how much pride was on that team.
*  That was impossible.
*  And honestly, they should have lost game six.
*  That was ridiculous that they won that game.
*  And speaking of game six, Bill, the zone, which completely stymied them at the end of that game, they thought they were getting good shots.
*  Missoula said that after the game, they actually thought they were getting good shots.
*  They were not getting good shots.
*  Right. It was a train wreck.
*  The film about the Philly series.
*  If Tatum doesn't heat up at the perfect time, we lose to Philly in six and he gets fired.
*  So that's the thing that the line of him getting fired versus not getting fired.
*  The Philly series, he gets fired.
*  If they get swept by Miami, he gets fired.
*  It sounds like you're going back to the podcast we did right after game seven where we both agreed there was no way they should bring back Joe Missoula.
*  Yeah. But you know, but we both felt really bad because we were like, well, what a terrible situation.
*  The guy took over a team in September and had no assistance.
*  And the only assistant he had, it was an NBA anything left halfway through the year.
*  And then he's got Marcus and Horford, you know, half coaching the team and Marcus putting himself in the games.
*  Out of necessity.
*  He had no intuitive sense at the moment.
*  Well, Brian, you know this because I was telling you, like, my dad was texting me in December.
*  Like, I don't know about this, Joe. I don't know what's going on here.
*  He was on it.
*  He was. He sits 20 feet away and you can see everything.
*  Well, I watched every time you and I always like to watch the timeouts and who's in control of the huddle.
*  Never, never was he in control of the huddle.
*  And it's pretty discouraging when that's your head coach.
*  Yeah. And I would say, too, like to your point about the Miami series, Bill, I was more aggravated in the Philly series because it took him forever to play the rob card and put him in the starting lineup.
*  And it was so obvious the only way you were going to get big minutes out of him is if you started him because Tucker was on the court.
*  Because what was happening is Rob was coming in and they were putting knee hanging.
*  So you had to start Rob to get those minutes.
*  It took him forever to realize that and the Tatum situation.
*  You finally got to a high pick and roll against Joel and beating game seven.
*  That card was there the entire series and they never it was not using not using white on pick and rolls.
*  And, you know, I just thought they threw whites offensive game away for the most part because they were so they're either jacking up threes or the pace of the game.
*  He never seemed to have control over. Everybody wanted us to go slow.
*  This is my dad's like biggest pet peeve was just walking it up.
*  We get over the half court line at 17 seconds, five more seconds.
*  Now we're down to 10 seconds and where nothing's happened yet.
*  You know, the game seven against Philly, which was a terrific home game, they never walked it up.
*  They ran that ball up every time they were on offense.
*  All the other playoff games and a lot of it's Marcus because he walks the ball up.
*  There was no pace at all.
*  And yeah, that's what the dog thing they did.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, it was cute at the beginning of the season when it was working, but they were like 25th in the NBA and pace in the fourth quarter.
*  And you got this lead by playing faster.
*  I don't know why they like to dribble the air out of the ball because they always go too late to write.
*  They almost start driving the ball with like five seconds.
*  You don't have any options when you do that.
*  That was an aggravating part to me before we let you guys go.
*  I got to ask you one question about Jalen because it appears all indications are he's getting the supermax.
*  And I was looking at it. I really think the only like second best player in a team that's gotten one is Rudy Gobert.
*  It correct me if I'm wrong in that bill. I was looking through the list like John Wall got one.
*  Russell Westbrook got one who is the best player in his team at that point in time.
*  Carl Anthony Towns got one at the time.
*  You know, he's the best player in the team, obviously not anymore.
*  But do you think that this solves the issues with Jalen because the article that Logan had at the ringer, he had another article with what?
*  The New York Times, I believe it was.
*  And he had that was the weird one. Yeah.
*  Yeah, he had been aggravated about the Kevin Durant thing, which I understand Jalen's frustration because at that point early on, the Kawhi, the Paul George thing,
*  he was young. So you can kind of understand that. Right.
*  But at this point, you're thinking I played better than Tatum in the finals and was his Tatum trying to get not the Tatum was trying to get Kevin Durant in there.
*  But he knows that Tatum and Durant are friends. But now you're going to move on from me at this point.
*  So I understood it. But I just wonder, does the supermax sort of solve all the issues that he has with the organization like him and Brad like in the organization in general?
*  They're all good now. Is that is this going to be a problem going forward?
*  Because it did feel like if Jalen didn't get the supermax and correct me if you guys feel differently that they were going to have to trade him.
*  That's how I felt because he was going to be a flight risk after the season.
*  Well, in the way the league works now, you can get the contract in a year after still push to get traded or, you know, it's it's certainly not long term security.
*  The thing that I don't understand yet because I haven't read the right article about it is you can like the supermax is the highest possible total you can pay him.
*  It doesn't mean that's what you have to pay him. Right.
*  What is it like five for two ninety something like that to ninety five.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So maybe it settles at five for two fifty or five for two forty.
*  To me, I wonder over the next few weeks, are they going to be negotiating over what that number is and it won't be the full number because if you're paying him two ninety five and you're paying Tatum over three hundred, which you should because he's he's he's the guy who has another level to go.
*  Now you can't have a roster basically that that is like you're just screwed.
*  You're basically have those two guys, two role players and then a bunch of minimum guys.
*  So I wonder, are they going to ask him to settle in the two thirty two forty range and what's his response going to be?
*  Because we saw this happen in 2012.
*  In 2012, James Harden, a trade I might have brought up once or twice where he wanted like sixty four for four years.
*  Right. That was the max. And OKC was like, now we'll do fifty two.
*  And they started haggling. And then all of a sudden the other teams came in like, well, we would have paid you five for eighty.
*  You know, and all of a sudden he's getting traded.
*  The other there's other teams out there that would pay him the two ninety five.
*  And if the Celtics won't, I think that's where this gets messy.
*  Would you do it, Dad? But they're not allowed to pay him the two ninety five.
*  I mean, if he's let's say that, you know, he's the guy that so easily it seems feeling disrespected.
*  And that's that's the danger of offering less than the max.
*  He feels disrespected and he says, no, I'm not going to sign.
*  I'm going to go as a free agent in a year. You get nothing.
*  That's a pretty big risk, though, because we've this is we've seen the junior version of that when the guys with the rookie contracts.
*  Can basically wait a year before they sign the extension if they want to really get frisky, all of them take the extension.
*  It's too much. You know, he's playing for twenty five next year.
*  So you're basically you're risking another twenty five million.
*  What if you get hurt? Yeah, he's not Tatum, you know, like if he blew out his ACL next year, he's not getting the two ninety five.
*  Has anyone accepted less than the maximum?
*  We've never kind of been in this space before, but I guess Bradley Beale would have been the first one that you would have said, oh, maybe he'll take 200 Bradley Beale's.
*  No, no, I actually take the two fifty one. Thanks.
*  Yeah. And I can't think of anyone. I can't think of any.
*  I kind of think I wish they could do that, Bill, where they could negotiate it with Jalen.
*  I just feel like that's going to be a nonstarter for him and his representation with all the scar tissue.
*  No, good, good idea, but we'll take the two ninety five.
*  Right. I think this would be a totally different conversation if Jalen didn't have his issues with the team in the past.
*  Like if this was just, hey, they had never tried to trade Jalen.
*  They're never there. Never been any bad blood.
*  I don't think it would be an issue whatsoever.
*  But because there is that scar tissue, I think that there is going to be something.
*  And I just wonder, too, like, does he actually finish out like when he gets the supermax, does he actually finish it with the Celtics?
*  Because what we're finding out, it's also very rare that these guys actually know that.
*  Yeah, I agree with you.
*  I just hope that after they sign him to the supermax, they have to get a championship in the first two to three years of it.
*  They have to get one. And look, next year I get technically the supermax doesn't kick in.
*  But after he signs that extension, they have to win it in the next two years.
*  Bill, do you know what's the window when they are from the supermax?
*  If that's what happens for him to.
*  Yeah, it's the summer.
*  But once you do it, you get it's basically what happened with like Jordan Poole and Tyler Hero this last year.
*  Like you once you're in the extension, you can't really get traded till July 1st.
*  So everybody's stuck with each other for a year.
*  There's no way. I mean, does he have a time window in terms of making a decision?
*  Yeah, it's before the start of the season.
*  I think it's like October, whatever.
*  But it's a long, it's a long calendar period.
*  Well, we talk about like the, you know, Jalen, the scars on his side, but you know, like how fired up are the Celtics to pay him 50 plus million dollars a year?
*  I don't. He was, you know, I thought he took a step back in the playoffs in a lot of ways that the thing that alarms me and my dad and I would talk about this a lot is what happened to his defense?
*  This was he was such a good two way player and I don't feel like he was the same two way player in the playoffs.
*  There was like he who is the guy that he shut down in the playoffs?
*  He had the hardened moment.
*  It was like a two game moment where remember they made the switch to put him on hardened where he was really good.
*  But that's it.
*  I mean, that's pretty much it.
*  And Jalen, Jimmy Butler, we like all they talked about was the in the Denver series.
*  Aaron Gordon and Jeff Green, they kept throwing size on Jimmy Butler.
*  How much the size bother him?
*  It's like we had fucking size.
*  Jason Tatum 6'9", Jalen Brown 6'8".
*  Like we had size and athleticism.
*  Why couldn't those guys like shut him down?
*  Yeah, and Tatum did do a good job on Jimmy.
*  They didn't even try.
*  It felt like they didn't even try Jalen on Jimmy whatsoever.
*  And the other thing about him defensively is it's just if and I know you go to most of the games, Dr.
*  Bill, you watch him play like when he's off the ball, he's always on the ball.
*  He's always on the ball.
*  He's always on the ball.
*  I was just going to say the same thing.
*  He's distracted all the time.
*  I mean, how many times does a guy get the rebound when he's not paying attention?
*  And he's lost.
*  He's distracted.
*  Well, there's that great picture of when Jimmy Butler took that three that he missed in 2022 that in the game,
*  seven, right?
*  And there's that wide shot of him lining up for the shot and Jalen, she's kind of standing in the middle of the court.
*  He's not guarding anybody.
*  He's just kind of like, Whoa, it looks like he's going to shoot that.
*  It's not here.
*  Anybody?
*  Yeah, he would get lost from time to time.
*  But the problem is it's a 30 team league and he's one of the best 30 guys in the league.
*  Like whether you want to rank them 21 or 90, you want to rank them in the league.
*  And I just want to make sure that the fan base doesn't overreact to the fact that he sucked in game seven because he also played a lot of good games for this team.
*  You know, unfortunately, sometimes you can kind of remember the last bad game.
*  My dad's making a face like, I don't know, I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't remember the last bad game.
*  My dad's making a face like getting rid of Marcus gained nine years for me in my lifespan and getting rid of Jalen is worth another six months.
*  I agree.
*  I thought Brown played better than Tatum in the most of the playoff games except game seven.
*  Obviously.
*  Yeah, I was.
*  I don't know if I'd go that far.
*  Well, having been at all the games, that's what I saw.
*  I saw Tatum disappearing except for that big game seven against Philip.
*  My dad is really my dad's really hoping Tatum spent the summer or is going to spend the summer working on what what two things that little pull up jumper on the foul line.
*  Please.
*  And then some sort of postgame around 10 feet.
*  Well, that's where I'm hoping is Angus makes a difference for Tatum because it's going to open up things.
*  But Tatum and the two point shots and maybe he can put away so many three point shots.
*  Yeah, it's it's kind of annoying because he clearly has the capability to do something in between the rim and the three point line.
*  Yeah.
*  And you can see from the way the defense reacts to it when they give them the ball near the basket, the defense reacts like they'll send a second guy at them.
*  They don't want him to have the ball within eight feet from the basket.
*  We never give it to them.
*  They're not with poor Zingas.
*  They're not going to be able to send too many second guys at them.
*  I mean, true.
*  I mean, Brad in his press conference after the draft last night, I thought he was right on target.
*  It changes the team's style of play.
*  It opens up the middle.
*  It opens up more pick and rolls.
*  And maybe there'd be less relying on the three.
*  Except what worries me is Joe Missoula.
*  Every time he talks about the team in the offense, he's all about the three point shot.
*  And that was the criticism.
*  Yeah, he just it was a very statistics based offense of, hey, the more threes we shoot, the better.
*  The better.
*  Brian, who do you think?
*  Let's say this is the team.
*  Who's the crunch time five?
*  It's poor Zingas and Tatum and Brown and Derek White.
*  Who's the fifth guy?
*  Like, are they going to like, dude, I think and poor together?
*  I think it's going to be 38.
*  Yeah, I think that he's going to lean on now.
*  I guess depending on.
*  Well, see, I think it depends on the matchup, too, because if they're comfortable with Rob out there,
*  be a lot more Rob.
*  But so you have Tatum, you have Brown, you have Derek White, you have poor Zingas.
*  Those are the four Givens.
*  I think he'd lean more out than he will because we saw that in the postseason.
*  It's very rare that we saw Robert Williams closing the game.
*  I guess the good thing about poor Zingas is he can play four and five.
*  Right. That's why I would actually start out.
*  Start now.
*  The irony of this is isn't Grant kind of the perfect guy?
*  Like the ideal of Grant in our heads to be the fifth guy in that crunch time.
*  Yeah, great.
*  And unfortunately, I think they screwed that up royally, I feel like.
*  And I know there's aggravation with him at times this year in terms of he wasn't the same defender.
*  I feel like they screwed that up.
*  Like, how could he get DNP's during the regular?
*  Maybe it's Hauser, Bill.
*  Now that I think maybe there's games where Hauser actually closes.
*  Can you imagine?
*  I do think everybody likes Grant and everybody says he just talks too much.
*  And I think after a couple of years, he's that guy at work that's like, oh my God, this guy.
*  And I don't know, maybe he wore out his welcome.
*  But what he did is what that fivesome would need.
*  I don't like Rob and poor Zingas together.
*  That's too weird for me.
*  Well, maybe it's an unknown player based on a sign of trade with Grant Williams.
*  Maybe we don't know who it is.
*  Or maybe. Maybe it's Walsh.
*  Walsh right away.
*  Or maybe it's like somebody on the Nets, you know, like somebody.
*  Maybe it's Dallas.
*  Maybe it's like Reggie Bullock.
*  I have no idea, but it feels like there's still a piece missing with this team.
*  Well, you know, the perfect guy is for this team is Dorian Finney Smith because they have all those wings in Brooklyn.
*  They obviously have bridges sign long term.
*  I just don't know how the Celtics make a trade for him.
*  But that type of player is like the perfect guy for the Celtics.
*  And maybe it's Brogdon.
*  Yeah, maybe it's Brogdon.
*  Yeah, you're probably right.
*  Maybe because you can still play fairly big that way with Brogdon, Derek White, Tatum Brown and poor Zingas.
*  That's probably it.
*  It's probably Brogdon.
*  As long as I want to run.
*  I want to run that phone call on the podcast of Brad and we're calling Brogdon like, hey, how's the summer going?
*  Yeah, you know, that little weird got a little weird there the day before draft night.
*  But we love you.
*  We think you're great.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, Brad, you tried to trade me, man.
*  It's not going great.
*  It's not going great.
*  OK, I think that phone call goes the Clippers wouldn't do the trade without you.
*  They wanted you so much.
*  Yeah, we just held.
*  We kept smarting the trade.
*  They said, no, we want you.
*  That's a good idea.
*  We tried to trademark it, but they wouldn't take them.
*  They wanted you.
*  Only you.
*  They wanted you.
*  Yeah, they have no witnesses.
*  My dad always used to love Danny.
*  Who was the guy?
*  Danny Ainge, the like the full shit radio interview guys.
*  Was it Danny Angel?
*  Was it Patino?
*  Who is the guy that used to get a kick out of every time?
*  It was Danny Ainge talking about, oh, no, we love so and so.
*  And you'd be like, oh, God, that was the kiss of death.
*  It's got to be better than Belichick on the radio.
*  Gives you absolutely nothing.
*  Well, you know, my dad, I know this is CelticsPod, but my dad is very focused on this Pats team.
*  I think the whole Simmons family is 12 and five isn't outrageous to anybody in our family.
*  Just so you know.
*  I sent.
*  Well, I think it Hopkins.
*  Yeah, I sent candy to the Andrea Hopkins house.
*  I hope you got it.
*  I know.
*  I just wish that would happen.
*  I'm sort of worried that he's waiting.
*  He's waiting for somebody to get hurt.
*  Well, so the problem is Beckham got that stupid Ravens contract, right?
*  He got one for 15 from the Ravens and everyone's like, well, that was so stupid.
*  But now if you're Hopkins, you're like, yeah, the price is one for 15 because that's what we want.
*  I'm better.
*  We have the money.
*  Spend the money on the.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think Bill, to that point, it's actually good that the Ravens gave him the stupid contract because it took out all these other suitors, these contenders around the league.
*  Right. Because the Andrea Hopkins at this point shouldn't want to play for the Patriots, but he wants to get 15 million dollars.
*  Right. He wants the opportunity.
*  Because he's 31.
*  He's not like 34 or 35.
*  So he still can be an elite receiver.
*  He was an elite receiver when he played last year.
*  He led the league in receptions per game once he came back from the suspension.
*  So if I'm him, there's no way I'm taking a minimal deal, so to speak, to use the NBA terminology to play for a contender.
*  Why? I'm too good to do that at this point.
*  I can do that three years from now or two years from now.
*  So I hope they get it done because, man, can they just give Mac a legit weapon and we can find out if this guy's any good?
*  Like, I want to find out if he's good or not.
*  It would be so much fun to have him on the team.
*  The problem is if Hopkins goes on YouTube and watches puts in Mac Jones, 2022 highlights in the clip is 40 seconds.
*  It's like, wait, this is a bad side.
*  Oh, my God. Oh, wait.
*  There's another throw to triple coverage.
*  Who's Tennessee's quarterback?
*  The competition.
*  Yeah, Tannehill.
*  And they're going to stink, too.
*  They're going to stink.
*  So we'll see.
*  I did a thing on my podcast on Tuesday that the Pats at plus 750 to win the AFC East is absolutely absurd to me.
*  The defense is going to be awesome.
*  To me, this team feels a lot like the O-1 team.
*  And with the difference being Tom Brady is not on this team.
*  But from a defense standpoint, which is a lot of young guys, like a real toughness and then a couple of guys who are just in their prime, who are really good depth all over the place.
*  Like, I just think this team is going to be really good.
*  And it was really nice of you to pay Jones's bail money because we really need him on the team.
*  They took the wrong bag. It wasn't his fault.
*  Somebody switched bags of them.
*  He thought he took the black bag, but he took the off black bag and he was just a mistake.
*  Who hasn't done that?
*  It's quite the defense.
*  The bag didn't have his name in it or anything along those lines either.
*  Hey, look, man, prove him wrong.
*  It happens.
*  Yeah.
*  We'll see how it goes.
*  Tell you this, I haven't been to Logan taking the wrong bag with loaded handguns.
*  That's just me.
*  Although I've gone through Logan a lot and it does seem to be one of the few airports you can basically take just about anything through.
*  It's everyone's just super friendly and they don't seem very focused.
*  So who knows?
*  Panda Jack.
*  Our guy.
*  All right. Well, hey guys, thanks for doing this.
*  It was a lot of fun.
*  Dr. Bill, I hope we made you feel better about Marcus being traded.
*  Yeah, it was good.
*  It was cathodic to talk it out.
*  Thank you guys.
*  Yeah, now he's going to put more focus on Joe Mazzullo again, which is where his focus should have been.
*  I'm going to cancel my therapy appointment for later this afternoon.
*  That's good.
*  Yeah, just go get a Bloody Mary.
*  Yeah.
*  Thanks so much, guys.
