# The Pressure Is on the Clippers to Win This Year | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JdshI4iK6I)
*  Like this Clippers run where you go back to the lockout season and then they have
*  this resurgence in lob city, 2012.
*  They get killed by the Spurs and the, in that playoffs.
*  The next year they get upset by Memphis.
*  2014 was a tough one because that was the year it seemed like they had a chance to
*  win the title and they choke against.
*  Okay.
*  See they lose that series the year after they have Houston that that game's done.
*  That series is done.
*  They completely choke.
*  It's one of the worst choke jobs, not just of the century, but probably in the
*  history of the NBA, they ended up losing to Houston in seven next four years.
*  Throw it away.
*  2021 or 2020 in the bubble.
*  They have the three one lead against Denver.
*  They blow it.
*  Right.
*  They, they just like impossible that Denver team was like, just couldn't have
*  been younger and less ready to do something like that.
*  And then 2021 it flips, right?
*  They beat Dallas.
*  They have that iconic Kawhi game.
*  It's like, here we go.
*  They're playing Utah.
*  I was at the game when he heard his ACL.
*  They're about to go up three one.
*  They look great.
*  They look, I would have picked them to win the title right there.
*  Kawhi gets hurt.
*  He's out.
*  They ended up losing to a Phoenix in the next round.
*  I think they were better than Phoenix.
*  Um, 2022 throw it away.
*  And now we're here again.
*  This is a pretty, this is, we're talking three presidential terms now of just kind
*  of up and down, up and down, up and down, along with one of the great what ifs ever.
*  What if Kawhi just decides to go to the Lakers?
*  And then they keep Shea and they keep all their picks and you just kind
*  of wait for the next guy might've been a better situation.
*  We're in year four of the, there's so much pressure on them to deliver this year.
*  I would say they have the most pressure in the league to come through.
*  If you go through all the teams, like Milwaukee is already one Boston.
*  They made the finals.
*  They're young.
*  Like they can get back Philly.
*  I guess just making the finals is their pressure, but the Clippers
*  out of anybody, I feel like that's the one where it's like our windows kind of closing.
*  We gave up all these assets.
*  Shea is like one of the best 13, 14 guys in the league now on top of all the
*  picks we gave up, who knows if Kawhi is ever going to be this healthy again.
*  Like it kind of has to happen this year.
*  Right.
*  Yes.
*  And I mean, these guys are under contract for a couple more years.
*  I just think that Kawhi is 31 is three years younger than KD.
*  And we look at KD is, I mean, just look at the trade hall that he got from
*  Phoenix, he's still obviously revered around the NBA is this, you get him on
*  your team and you can win the title.
*  And some major, major miles on Kawhi though, even more, and not that KD
*  doesn't have major miles, but Kawhi's had two, basically missed two plus
*  seasons just with two different injuries.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, again, I see the skepticism and I totally see the concern and I'm not
*  going to sit here and say that there's no pressure on them.
*  Obviously there is, there's a ton of pressure.
*  There's, I mean, if you're a bomber and you're paying a nine figure luxury
*  tax for this team, you're expecting to go to the finals, at least you're
*  expecting a deep playoff run.
*  You should be expecting the championship based on the talent, the
*  veteran savvy experience on this team.
*  I just think they're perfectly built for the postseason.
*  And it's really weird when you look at their regular season profile and you say,
*  Oh, this team's a championship contender when their net rating is the same as
*  the Washington wizards, their offensive rating is worse than the Los Angeles
*  Lakers, like that just doesn't scream championship contender, but they're just
*  kind of singular in the fact that they have this guy who does not play six
*  games in a row.
*  He probably won't for the rest of the season.
*  And when he's on the court, they're a juggernaut.
*  And I don't know how you kind of.
*  You can't dismiss it.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't dismiss it.
*  On the other hand, like I want stretches during the season that at least show me
*  over a sustained three week stretch.
*  You were good.
*  Like Milwaukee just ripped off 10 in a row, right?
*  And, and maybe 11 tonight, but after we tape this, the Clippers are 10 and six
*  in their last 16 in their last 35, they're 18 and 17.
*  They just haven't, they haven't laid the smackdown.
*  Even Philly did it.
*  Philly went on that West coast trip and they laid the smackdown, you know, and
*  they were just really good for a few games in a row.
*  And I think you have to show that at some point in the season.
*  The reason I think it's an important thing to bring up after the all star
*  break, they're kind of set up to do that.
*  You know, and I think I want to see from them, can you just be good for two and
*  a half weeks in a row, right?
*  Can you go nine and one?
*  Can you go 11 and two?
*  Can you just have a run that makes me want to take you seriously?
*  Because otherwise that the history just isn't that great.
*  You kind of have to kind of have to throw it around once during this season.
*  My teams, the Celtics, I feel like they've at least, even though they've had so few
*  time with their best guys together, they've at least had these stretches around like,
*  all right, this team, this is, this is a really good team when we get everybody back.
*  You know, I know that the Philly fans, we talked to Chris Ryan about this before,
*  like this Philly team has been really good for a long stretch.
*  The question for them is more like, all right, what happens if things unraveled
*  during a game?
*  You know, what happens if it's game five and all of a sudden we go cold for a
*  quarter and just every everything gets weird, but the Quippers, we know that
*  their ceiling is as good as just about anybody.
*  I was going to be, this is the X factor.
*  It really is.
*  I was in the Nets locker room last night after their, their win against the heat.
*  Mikael Bridges goes for 45, just looks incredible.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was just joking around.
*  I was saying like, Hey, you guys could, I was just talking to some people with
*  the team, like, Hey, you guys could be the sixth seed face Philly in the first round.
*  You go up to one and everyone in Philadelphia melts down.
*  Who knows what could happen with you guys.
*  Right.
*  And they would be like totally unafraid, you know, and, and they have the best
*  13th man in the league and Ben Simmons.
*  So if, if a bunch of people fall out, he can come in and maybe play in the third OT.
