# Jason Hehir on Directing ‘The Last Dance’ | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZiZLbjo_Q)
*  All right.
*  So last dance, which became by far the most successful thing you were
*  involved with and one of the most successful sports documenters of all time.
*  And probably one of the most successful documenters of all time, um, was not an
*  enjoyable experience capped off with the fact that COVID happened right as you
*  were trying to finish it.
*  And you were trying to finish the last couple of episodes in isolation from
*  your crew and people are in different parts and you're just trying to get shit
*  up.
*  And it's not, none of it is the typical documentary experience combined with,
*  it's not the typical human experience combined with, are we all going to die?
*  And it's like April 19th, I got to get this last dancing.
*  It seemed like a disaster, a disaster for the doc.
*  And it ended up being weirdly the best thing that ever could happen in the doc
*  because we had nothing to do on April 19th.
*  Yeah.
*  Which you never could have that.
*  That's another example of like, just go with the flow.
*  You cannot predict what's going to happen.
*  Keep your head down and try and do good work and hopefully the chips fall in the
*  right place.
*  But I look back at that experience.
*  The way that you look back at like college where you lived in a shitty place and it
*  had like mice and there were like so many days when in the moment it would have
*  been like, God, I can't wait to get out of here.
*  And you look back at it and you're like, man, that was such a blast.
*  And I love those people and I miss that aspect of it.
*  So rose colored glass is easy to look back, especially because the doc was successful
*  and people's careers thrive from that.
*  And it worked out well for so many people involved at the time.
*  Very stressful.
*  But I get that question sometimes of like, how much harder was it because it was
*  supposed to air on off nights of the finals in June of 2018.
*  So game one was on a Thursday.
*  Episodes one and two would air on Friday and so on throughout the finals.
*  They were going to checkerboard them with the finals.
*  It always would have done a big number because it's Michael Jordan.
*  2020, not 2000.
*  I'm sorry.
*  2020.
*  Although first they said it was coming in 2018 and 2019 and 2020.
*  Finals coming for four years.
*  Yes.
*  So or 24, depending on how you look at it.
*  So the fact that we had a deadline that was like, all right, it has to air because
*  the deadline had been pushed so many times and so many people who were very powerful
*  involved were like, all right, you know what?
*  You don't want to do it our way.
*  We're not doing it.
*  And it got pushed and pushed and pushed.
*  Finally, now they publicized on April 19th.
*  This is coming.
*  That was a relief for us because you can't give me notes on April 20th
*  on episodes one and two anymore.
*  We're done.
*  They aired.
*  You can't give me notes anything beyond like April 17th.
*  You can't give me notes because we can't do them in time.
*  So now we had like we knew I use the example like if I told you sprint as fast as you can
*  and I wouldn't and I didn't tell you when to stop that really flux with your mind
*  because you're like, I'm going as hard as I can.
*  But if I say sprint down to that telephone pole as fast as you can, you can do that all day
*  because you have an end goal in mind when you don't have the end in mind.
*  And we had four entities who were used to getting their way billion dollar entities
*  in the Jordan brand and the NBA and Netflix.
*  Right.
*  And the Jordan brand is the hardest one to deal with because they're trying to protect their guy.
*  Right.
*  Way less of that than I anticipated.
*  I thought that was going to be by far the hardest part of the doc.
*  And they the only time we ever got pushback that I had to take something out
*  was there was a clip of Scotty in the locker room in the training room with Michael and I think Ron
*  Harper saying and this was part of that like 400 hours of behind the scenes footage in the 98
*  season. He was saying something to the effect that when they win the championship, he's going to take
*  a cattle prod and stick it up Jerry Krause's ass and give him a heart attack. And everyone laughed.
*  And they were like, whoa, you got to take that out.
*  And it was to the point where I followed for Dion Kakouros, who was a great guy and a big
*  executive at the NBA. I followed him to his train station at Grand Central to his train, like
*  the actual like when he's getting on the train and like pulled him off the train and said, dude,
*  you got to let me put it on because I was trying to show people all of the hazing that this poor
*  guy endured. And the way that audiences took it when it came out was, oh, he's shitting on Jerry
*  Krause and making Michael a hero. That was never my intent. My intent was to show what this guy
*  went through to keep that team together. But that was the only time. And it was Michael's people who
*  led the charge saying, you can't do that. He's got a wife who's alive and it's enough. We get it.
*  They hazed him. They bullied him. But that was the only thing. Like they went from the beginning of
*  the process saying, you don't need to interview Michael. He's been interviewed 8,000 times. Any
*  sound bite you need, you can find. No baseball, no gambling, no dad. They wanted just the 98 season
*  when we started. This was in 2016 when we were first meeting with them all the way to 2020.
*  And they really weren't giving pushback on that level. What we were getting was a lot of pushback
*  from everybody on things like Michael doesn't listen to hip hop or can't be hip hop in this.
*  Or use this angle instead of that angle. It was little things like that. Things that I didn't
*  anticipate them trying to interfere with, they interfered with. And your musical choices.
*  A lot of times, yeah. But hey, why are you using that song? What about this song instead? Which is
*  like, if you're a director, it's a direct violation. Once you're suggesting alternate musical choices.
*  But that thing is you're working with people that had never made one before. So they don't get it.
*  I remember I said to someone on Michael's team, I was like, listen, all due respect, it would be
*  like if I came to you and told you how to design and sell a shoe. And they were like, totally get
*  it. But this is the way it is. And you're going to have to deal with it. I was like, okay.
*  Well, so for people listening who don't really understand how hard it is to make a documentary.
*  Because you're basically, you're going into the all time rabbit hole for a year, in this case,
*  a couple of years. You're interviewing all these different people. You're cataloging the interviews,
*  trying to remember what sound bites might pop. You're also cataloging all of the archive video
*  at the same time. You're trying to build some sort of outline. Then you're trying to figure out
*  which interviews, which pieces can I use to help tell my story of this archive?
*  So you have that whole process, but now you're getting notes too. Once you start having like
*  the super duper rough cuts or whatever, and you're sending stuff out, but you're sending out.
*  Normally the best case scenario is you're sending it to one place and they're giving you notes back.
*  Two is doable. You're getting notes back from Netflix, ESPN, your production team,
*  and then MJ's team. You're getting four different sets of notes that just come in.
*  And the NBA.
*  Oh, and the NBA, there's five.
*  So the NBA is at the front of the line.
*  They're just all sending you bullet point notes of like, do this, we don't like this,
*  have you considered this? And now you have to harness all these different notes from all these
*  different places, which is the kind of thing that can drive somebody crazy.
*  And it did. Asked my then girlfriend, now wife. I was tearing my hair out because there was
*  so many things going on internally. It would be hard enough to do this without the notes.
*  We had five edit rooms going at all times, cranking on five different parts of the doc.
*  So you go in on Tuesday morning and sit with the editor for the beginning of episode two,
*  and then you go into the next room and we'll work on the middle of episode six.
*  And they go into the next room and you work on the end of episode one. Put it this way. It took us
*  two years. It took us a year and a half to finish episode one.
*  And it took us 12 days to do episode 10.
*  That's how compressed that timeline was at the end, because everyone had the time. It was like,
*  okay, let's get you never going to get, especially from those four entities,
*  you're never going to get no notes. It's never going to be done.
*  So if it was going to air in a year, be like, yeah, given by the end, by March,
*  we were getting 30 pages of notes, single spaced total from these four entities.
*  And on page nine, it would say too much Rodman. And on page 26, it would say more Rodman.
*  So we actually got John Dahl, God bless him, came in from ESPN and he was like the notes whisperer.
*  He had to be the guy who vetted everything and made a document that at least made sense.
*  Because you can't, you literally can't do more and less of the same thing.
*  The other thing about you, one reason we like each other is we both run a little hot every
*  once in a while. I was watching this from afar because I was involved and you were telling me
*  some of this stuff. And I was like, oh my God, I'm just going to be reading the New York,
*  New York post headline. One day it was like sports documentary director strangles. So
*  this is going to go bad. I'm not proud of some of those meetings, but I was at my wits end, man.
*  Like we, and top of that, everyone, not just me, everyone's dealing with, especially in New York,
*  you hear sirens all day long with people dying in them outside. But if you look back, if you go to
*  those like Jalen and Jacoby recaps that we did, you can tell how bad that week was by the condition
*  of my voice, which I lost screaming on the phone a couple of times. Everybody was just like at their
*  wits end with that thing. So what was, what do you remember? What do you remember all these years
*  later about just being in a room with MJ, trying to interview him a couple of times? Cause that,
*  is that something you could have done 10 years earlier in your career? Or did you need the,
*  the reservoir of experience to even handle somebody like that? Who's so famous and he's so
*  smart about how to control a room. Yeah, it's, I don't think I mean, I could have sat there in
*  the chair and it wouldn't have been nearly as effective an interview. I had experience with
*  more people of high stature at that point and more experience with nerves and butterflies, but still
*  there's no one who's going to eclipse him. Yeah. Obama, Clinton, magic, no matter who Larry bird
*  being for Boston, Jordan's a different beast when he walks in the room. It's just like, he radiates
*  fame. I tried to write about this in my basketball book. Like there's just something different about
*  it. Plus he's tall and it's just, he's tall and he has them and just his hands are enormous. Like
*  when he's, when he's talking to you and his finger comes out, his finger looks like it's 18 inches
*  long and it's not just fame, there's fame and then there's significance. This guy is like talking to
*  Santa Claus. It's like talking to the Statue of Liberty. Like this is something he's a staple in
*  my childhood and indelible staple on what I wore, what was on my wall, what we watched on TV, what
*  we acted like. And it doesn't even seem like he's a real person. He's like a folk hero. So when you
*  meet him, it's like, wait a second, this guy actually like, he actually, his nose itches
*  sometimes. Like he actually has to clear his throat sometimes because you always see everything
*  too. It's like edited. Everything I'd ever seen was like edited and put together. So to see him
*  just operating in the world as a normal guy and laughing at jokes and stuff, his team was smart
*  enough to put me in front of them a few times before we actually sat down to interview. So I got
*  to spend like an hour here or there with him. So at least he knew. So he's a little camaraderie
*  with them. He would have said yes to anybody I'm sure, but they vetted me and then I could
*  demonstrate to him a little bit at a time that I wasn't going to be the guy posing for pictures.
*  I wasn't going to fanboy out. And I had some modicum of knowledge of what I was talking about. I
*  remember he quizzed me the first time we met. We were talking about his 63 point game
*  against the Celtics because I was there. That's the only time I'd ever been in the same room with
*  him in my entire life before that meeting in 2017 was at that game with my dad. And he was like,
*  when was that again? And I was like April 20th, 1986. It was game two, blah, blah, blah.
*  So little things like that I could prove to him. Like I knew what I was talking about. I had read
*  the books. I'd done the research. When I met with Phil Jackson, we went to his house in Montana
*  and he literally slammed the door in my face. Tolan and I went up to the door, rang the bell,
*  and he said, can I help you? He thought we were like fans who had found his address.
*  And we were told through other people that he knows you're coming. He did not know we were
*  coming. He literally slammed the door in our face. And then he called his daughter who knew
*  some people at the NBA and they vouched for us. So he led us into his house and we set up in the
*  backyard. And he said, who's in charge? And I said, I am. And he said, what kind of research
*  have you done? And I told him that for two years, I had read over 10,000 pages and like, I am the
*  one telling this story for better or worse. Same thing with Isaiah. He pulled me aside and said,
*  what kind of research have you done for this story? Of course, everyone, they know they kind
*  of have to do it. MJ sent a letter to 105 people saying like, Jason's team is going to call you.
*  I vouch for this doc. I'm participating. I hope you'll participate too. So people, everyone except
*  Carl Malone and Brian Russell said yes to us. So, but they wanted to know that they were in
*  good hands. I'm sure, you know, obviously people in the interim have mixed feelings about their
*  participation and what the doc said and what it didn't say and all that. But it was, it was a
*  process. Yeah, that was an interesting outcome of that. I mean, that's like when a documentary
*  gets big enough. And especially if you're framing it a certain way over 10 episodes, right? The
*  person it's about is going to be the hero. And then everybody that goes against the hero,
*  they're not the villains necessarily, but it's the sports movie and they're on the other team
*  of the sports movie. And, you know, I, I really like Isaiah, you know, and like when we had our
*  bad boys experience with him, um, Jalen, I got to watch him watch the bad boys doc in real time
*  cause he hadn't seen it. And he was so emotional watching it. Cause I just feel like he's really
*  torn up that that team and, and, and Isaiah himself just didn't get the credit they probably
*  deserve. So when I was watching it, that it was the best and the worst of them, cause sometimes
*  he can't help himself either. Right? So he had a couple of those guys are wired that way. Yeah.
*  Where you're like, I have to use that. Like he said it. Um, but then you'd think like the,
*  the, the shocking thing to me was Pippen though, how mad Pippen was about it. Um, and it really
*  seems like they've had a breach ever since, right? Like Pippen and Jordan, this feels really bad.
*  Like, I don't feel like Pippen's like a hundred percent recovered from the doc. And I don't really
*  understand it. I can't speak to their relationship. I can't obviously speak to the making of the doc
*  and Scotty's role as a main character in that doc. Put it this way. I cared so much about
*  showing the full context of the decisions he made in taking that shitty contract and why he was
*  doing the things he was doing that we went to Hamburg, Arkansas to show that he came from this
*  place of abject poverty where 11 people lived under one roof and a shack with two of them
*  in wheelchairs. This was a guy who was taught from the time he was a little kid that it can all go
*  out the window. If you step on the wrong step and you fall down and you have a terrible accident,
*  or his dad has a stroke in front of him at his kitchen table. His dad's in a wheelchair. Most of
*  his, that's why he took whatever it was 17 million over eight years or over seven years or whatever,
*  whatever that contract was, which they told him not to take and blah, blah, blah.
*  But we dedicated an entire episode to him, which was the second episode. Michael gets the first,
*  Scotty gets the second, Dennis gets the third and Phil gets the fourth. That was always the plan.
*  And I knew that we had to show the migraine game because that's when they could not overcome
*  the Pistons in game seven of 1990. Scotty gets a migraine and they lose. You have to show that.
*  And you have to show- During the social media era, that goes a lot worse for him, I think.
*  Way worse. Yeah. Way worse. And believe me, we could have leaned into a lot of these things. And
*  I'm not out there to ruin anybody's life. And there were more inflammatory soundbites we could
*  have used about people's feelings on his team about that. But I felt for the guy and I thought,
*  like, all right, he's had enough. Like he says he's seeing double. Michael said he says he had a
*  migraine. If he has a migraine, what can I say? I mean, Michael said enough right there. Then you
*  have to show what's going on with the Bulls while Michael is off playing baseball. Because this is a
*  doc about the Bulls dynasty. As much as people wanted to call it the Michael Jordan doc, it's
*  about the dynasty. Of course it stars him. He's the alpha and the omega. And those 18 months when he
*  eventually decides to come back, part of it is because what's going on with the Bulls. Yeah.
*  Yes. I wrote- And he had a great season when he was gone. He was awesome. But he also,
*  what fans outside of Chicago especially, like me, remember is that he wouldn't go in when that
*  player was called for Tony. And Tony hits the shot. And that was one of the things that Scott
*  is going to be remembered by. We had to include that. But in my mind, I'm thinking in episode 10,
*  he's going to get his redemption because game six of the 98 finals might be the grittiest,
*  toughest non-NFL performance I've ever seen any athlete give. We all know what it feels like when
*  you pull your back out. Yeah, his back's almost broken. I wrote when I did the pyramid piece about
*  him for my basketball book, I spent a bunch of time on him not going back in that 94 game because
*  I actually thought it was defensible. Like I get it. Like he took so much shit for that, but it was
*  like they're building him up that whole year as this is your team. You've got to carry us. We don't
*  have Michael. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. And when you put somebody in that state of
*  mind, like they expect to take that last shot. We're watching with the Celtics right now, Jason
*  Tatum. I don't think he's necessarily the best option for them in a lot of these games when it's
*  tied with 19 seconds left, but it's his team. So they kind of have to give him the ball,
*  whether that's the right idea or not, who knows. But with Pittman, I think he's like, wait a second,
*  I'm not going to fucking get the last shot. Like you just told me I was the guy for eight months.
*  But they ran that play earlier in the season and it worked in the exact same situation and it works.
*  And by the way, what goes unsaid is how clutches Tony Kukos to hit that shot. Right. It was a
*  really tough shot, but yeah, it's too bad that he got stuck with that. I thought he was treated
*  fairly in the, in the totality of the doc. I thought you did a really good job covering all of him.
*  I have my theory, which is that he hasn't watched the whole thing and was told by so many people,
*  they did you wrong. They just like, I'm not going to watch it. That's my theory. I'll never get to
*  talk to him again about it. And I regret that anyone would feel bad coming out of it. But if
*  everyone feels great about a doc at the end of it, then you probably didn't do your job because
*  we're not there to make friends with these guys. Yeah. Did you, you created the iPad thing, right?
*  That was you. Did that, did anyone do that before you? It's, I mean, the mazes did it during Gimme
*  Shelter when they showed. Oh, yeah, you're right. You're right. I just don't remember like, here's
*  an iPad where you watch this and narrate. That's happened before Last Dance. I don't remember it.
*  I think it's been used in other mediums. We did it, a dumbed down version of it in Bernie and Ernie,
*  where I was showing Ernie Grunfeld, Bernard King talking about being beaten by the cops while he
*  was in Tennessee. Now we didn't shoot it the right way. And I was learning as I went. The way you
*  shot it, I felt like was unique because just him getting it, like the look on his face.
*  And he knew it was coming. It was like, we couldn't have foreseen that. He was like
*  performative with it too, in a way that made it more fun. I just don't remember seeing that before.
*  My whole thing was to, my philosophy going in with him was don't ask him questions in order
*  chronologically. Keep him on his toes. And I had, when I would look at him in the chair,
*  I would make a mental note of like his shoulders are in line with that table behind him. Once they
*  go down below that table and he's sagging and getting sick of talking to me, pull out the iPad.
*  Right. As a little gift, as a little treat, as a little toy. He likes nothing better than games.
*  It's like my parents, my mom used to tell me that when they brought us to church or somewhere,
*  we were little kids, she'd pull out like a bag of Cheerios and then five minutes later,
*  a matchbox car, and then five minutes later, something else to play with. That was the reason
*  why. And also I met one of those meetings that where I met with him, when I told you they set
*  up those meetings, somehow I asked him, have you ever been thrown out of a game? And he was trying
*  to remember and somehow his fight with Reggie Miller came up. So I pulled my phone out and I
*  Googled Michael Jordan fights and this like seven minute montage that some genius did on YouTube
*  that would make him want to run through a wall came up and I showed it to him and he took the
*  phone from me and just locked in and he's mumbling to himself like, yeah, the night before I saw him
*  at a bar the night before and he told me he was just, he was giving the backstory to all these
*  fights and all these moments and I was like, oh my God, like this is, this is what I need to,
*  anytime I'm on these shoots and the first story I want to tell my friends or my brothers or you,
*  that should be in the doc. Like that's the lesson. I was like, all right, we have to find a way to
*  recreate this and also to get these people in the room because it's not going to fire him up. If I
*  tell him Isaiah said this to me, but if I show him Isaiah saying it, his competitive fire immediately
*  stows. The second interview we did with him, when we sat down,
*  one of the first questions was, are you watching? It was during the playoffs. It was, it was May of
*  2019 and I said, he said yes. And I said, what do you miss the most? And I barely got the question
*  out of my mouth and he said, proving people wrong. That's what I miss the most, proving people wrong.
*  Like who needs to prove anything less than Michael Jordan does, but as we know from the doc, he
*  found a way to conjure these, these and antagonizations from people that didn't even
*  exist. He had to just make them up. I think Brady did a lot of the same thing. Yeah. It was so cool
*  to watch. All those guys do. It was so cool to watch what you did with it because I still have
*  the DVD. The NBA gave us, I'm going to say like, oh, seven Oh eight of this 1998 version. Yeah.
*  And it was two hours, but the footage was so, the footage was the meal ticket and it was like,
*  Oh my God, you have this? It was a little like the Beatles doc when they, when they had that
*  last album. It was like, wait, this existed? It was one of those. And to watch it all crafted the
*  right way. Did you interview Kobe for it? I can't remember. I did. We interviewed him in July of
*  2019. We interviewed him the day of the ESPYs in 2019, cause we interviewed him at his office.
*  And as soon as we finished, he was going to his helicopter to take a helicopter to the staple
*  center for the, for the, obviously it wasn't the day of the accident, but for the ESPYs that night.
*  I got to watch it again. I feel like that whole, it was in that COVID blur. I've seen pieces of it
*  because sometimes it's on the different channels, but I got to watch it start to finish. LeBron
*  wasn't in it though. He was not. No episode. Episode five was Kobe, cause that was the all-star
*  break. We had that footage of him at the all-star game and Michael saying in the East locker room,
*  that little Laker boy is going to, I forget what he said. It seems like he had kind of blessed
*  Kobe, but it's interesting to me that LeBron's not in it and not really wasn't really mentioned
*  in the doc. Right. Once you open that door, then you have to have that discussion. And I was never
*  interested in having that discussion. If people in a, in a, you know, if they're at a bar and
*  having this discussion about the goat, if they want to cite things that they saw in the last day,
*  it's great. But I never wanted to sit there because we're going to ask LeBron and you know,
*  he's going to say, he's going to say, I admire the guy. I wear 23 because of him. I grew up watching
*  him. We'll show a picture of him wearing Jordans. Like there's, there's going to be no surprises
*  there. It doesn't help your 98 story. No, we're trying to keep it. Our present tense was the 90s
*  and LeBron was not a part of that story. That makes sense. Yeah. Cause I, I don't think,
*  I think since last dance came out, the goat conversation then heats up to another level.
*  And then I do think it affected LeBron. I think it's affected where he sees his place in it and
*  the competition of it. And you know, in a weird way, it was the best possible thing that could
*  happen for his career. It's like this new carrot that popped up. Oh, you think that guy's the goat?
*  Cause he wins the title right after the last dance. Cause it was generational too, is that
*  kids my nephew's age were team LeBron and guys our age were team MJ. And now all these kids are
*  watching the last dance and like, Oh, wait a second. This guy actually was really, really good.
*  We, Rossell and I were talking about on Sunday nights cause we didn't have sports to talk about.
*  We were amazed that people under like 30 didn't know any of this. They were like, Oh, that Dennis
*  Rodman. What a crazy guy. I'm like, yeah, it's Dennis Rodman. You didn't know this, but
*  what's been the response since? Cause you did a lot of media when it came out, but since it came out
*  and then it became this thing that people point to when they're trying to like some music, I want
*  to do the, my last dance of this and that. And it's become a little bit of the lingo now, but
*  what's it been like to watch that over the last four years as it's discussed that way?
*  It's great that that's become kind of parlance for like, Oh, the pats are going to do their last
*  dance and, and, uh, wait till the warriors do their last dance and wait till LeBron does his
*  last dance. It's as we see, like you said, these things are cyclical and 15 years ago,
*  I got a call from Michael Buble saying, can you do my version of 24 seven? And it's like, what are
*  you going to box Harry Connick? How are we doing a 24 seven about Michael Buble? What he meant was,
*  can you go behind the scenes with me with great editors and great cinematographers and make a
*  talk about me? So that became, then it was like our 30 to 30, then it was our last dance. And now
*  it's our drive to survive, the drive to survive. And now it's like our quarterback. These things
*  are cyclical and every couple of years, something comes out and through some magic, it hits and
*  becomes part of the vernacular. Um, are you going to direct my last dance, my last year of
*  podcasting? Are you rolling on it? We're already rolling. This is it. 2024. Let me know who you
*  want me to hire to log 400 hours of you sitting in the corner of that room, different camera angles,
*  doing a podcast.
