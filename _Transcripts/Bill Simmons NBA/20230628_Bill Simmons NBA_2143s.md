# The Chicago Bulls Are Stuck in NBA Hell | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axVKDnVVeCs)
*  All right. So Jason Goff is here and I did a lot of bulls research.
*  The bulls are the ugly duckling of the 2023 summer.
*  They're not in any conversations.
*  Nobody knows whether they're a buyer or a seller, whether they matter,
*  whether they don't matter.
*  You can make a case.
*  They're the most interesting team, the least interesting team.
*  I'm sure you're you're in the fray there in Chicago,
*  trying to figure out ways to talk about them.
*  I'm going to start here.
*  Derrick Rose blows out his knee in that Philly series in 2012
*  at the end of Game One that there was on the baseline for that.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Has anything good happened since then?
*  We're not talking 11 plus years and basically 12 seasons slash post seasons.
*  Is this an official?
*  You can point to that and go, oh, God, since that.
*  Oh, what's been good?
*  I mean, there's a direct line of demarcation in terms of bulls fans,
*  hopes and dreams that could be achieved as opposed to what you were trying to get back to.
*  And since the feeling was so short, like you mentioned it.
*  And, you know, there's a few things that I'll never, ever forget is where I was
*  when Goran Dragich dare go upstairs with Derrick Rose.
*  I was in the press box in that weird, funky Phoenix, you know, situation up there
*  in the second level where you got to look at people that are fans and say, yeah,
*  that's what he kind of does.
*  And then on the baseline, me and that Gray Sam walking back towards the
*  the media room, thinking that the game was, you know, getting ready to wrap up,
*  beat the whole media horde that's coming back there.
*  And you see him go down.
*  And from that moment on, asking his brothers and talking to people around him
*  and then the whole is he going to play?
*  Is he not going to play?
*  And then the stuff being leaked about his his teammates taking care of him in practice
*  and how he should be out there on the court, like all the things
*  that happened from that moment.
*  It was such a sour point in Chicago sports history that
*  definitely is going to probably be something 15, 20 years from now
*  that we'll be looking at as one of those times where we just caught
*  a bad break as a fan base.
*  I mean, you know, Gale Sayers and Dick Buccus never played in meaningful
*  football games, right?
*  Like, you look at the careers of Andre Dawson and Billy Williams
*  and characters like that, and you're like, man, those players really
*  never got a chance to shine on a real stage.
*  Derrick Rose was going to be that post Jordan
*  reintroduction, not only to relevancy, but to expectation.
*  You know, because we went through Kirk Heinrich, Andre's Noccioni, Ben Gordon
*  and that spunky bull squad that they were there to take you to six.
*  But we all knew what it was going to be.
*  And then Derrick popped into the scene.
*  And from that point on, you know, the Jimmy Butler coming of age,
*  you know, Tom Fibbido interactions with John Paxson
*  and the front office mean from that point on, you can see the dominoes
*  begin to drop in.
*  And that's exactly how it happens when you're planning on something
*  being there for seven to 10 years and being at a certain level
*  and just dropping off the map.
*  And then all of a sudden you have them to scrape together pieces
*  and put together things and all of a sudden egos getting away.
*  And on top of that, that core that he grew up with started to get older.
*  Right. That window started to dissipate without him.
*  So, yeah, if you want to talk about Bulls basketball, you can look at that
*  as a clear line of demarcation.
*  Yeah, you think in the 2012-13 season, No, was first team on NBA.
*  And I think I might have voted for him like third or fourth for MVP that year.
*  He was awesome. He was top five or something.
*  Yeah. Butler was coming on and you had all the pieces.
*  Lou was still, you know, healthy enough.
*  And he had already gone through his issues with the training staff
*  and the organization like there was there was a buildup to that point.
*  And you got the comment and you got a chance to take a picture of it.
*  And somebody came through and burned your Polaroid.
*  So you would never have a memory of that either.
*  Like we watch mixtapes quite often around these parts when it comes to yearning
*  for that old Derrick Rose sensation of feeling. I know I do. I'm not going to.
*  Yeah. He's the reason why my career, I think, took the turn that it took
*  because I covered him from the moment he stepped into the game.
*  And it was an unbelievable.
*  It's weird to say this, but a break for LeBron in Miami and Cleveland,
*  where he loses Dwight Howard.
*  Dwight Howard's like first team on NBA for like six straight years.
*  He goes sideways, ends up switching conferences.
*  Rose gets bounced.
*  And then it's like, who's even in the East to go through for years
*  and years and years? It would have been Ricky year.
*  Your guy, Ricky year.
*  I mean, come on, Jason Tatum.
*  He was right. But he shows up in 2017.
*  Like, yeah, it probably would have been Rose would have been the guy.
*  So George was still in that mix, too.
*  You know, Indiana. Yeah.
*  I went back.
*  I looked at every season since the season after Rose got hurt.
*  So 2012, 13 on and tried to figure out how many teams
*  have not had a top eight record over that span.
*  And the answer was seven teams.
*  It was Detroit. It was Orlando, Washington, Minnesota, New Orleans,
*  Charlotte and Chicago.
*  And you look at those seven teams and it's like, you know, five small market teams.
*  Washington, who can't stay out of their own way.
*  But then the Bulls, who, you know, are in the third biggest market
*  in the league that have the Jordan legacy and all that.
*  Then you start doing more digging.
*  They've paid the luxury tax once in the history of the franchise.
*  Right.
*  They got lucky with high lottery picks three times.
*  And it ended up being Wendell Carter, seventh,
*  Kobe White, seventh, Patrick Williams, fourth.
*  And you could go through those drafts to go, should have taken that, should take that.
*  But it was more.
*  I mean, really, the bad luck was they were pretty close to Luca
*  and Trey that draft, but they're too back and it just kind of never happened.
*  The last All-Star they drafted was Jimmy Butler in 2011.
*  They've had four first round exits and two second round exits.
*  They were only bottom five once.
*  They're the classic definition of you never want to be in the middle.
*  Right. You think of the Bulls.
*  Yeah. NBA hell, treadmill, mediocrity, whatever you want to call it.
*  Not bad enough to get that top pick.
*  Not good enough to really contend for anything material, especially here.
*  Like you mentioned, I mean, this we witnessed and I witnessed as a kid.
*  And then growing up, one of the great dynasties of all time in sports.
*  Yeah. The early 90s Bulls, I knew what I was going to be doing every June for eight years.
*  So it's tough to wrap your head around it.
*  And also some of the things that didn't happen along the way, like you mentioned,
*  you know, the kicking of the tires of Klay Thompson in that draft and not coming up with him.
*  You know, the being told reportedly being told by Tom Thibodeau
*  and other people in that organization, hey, not Marcus T.
*  Draymond Green.
*  You know, the little things that as you go along, and I'm sure every city
*  and every organization has these little things.
*  But when you like you mentioned the third market, you can't really hide behind.
*  OK, it's not a destination spot.
*  There are plenty of NBA players who live here during the summer
*  and understand that that's pretty much all they have to do.
*  And you've also signed big free agents like it's not like you haven't.
*  But they just were at the wrong points of their careers.
*  Yeah. Ben Wallace, Carlos Boozer, Dwayne Wade pulled them from Miami.
*  But I mean, at the time it was a big deal.
*  Then it turned out it wasn't.
*  Yeah. But that was at the time, too, where we were talking about the three Alphas
*  and knowing that that wasn't going to work with Rajon Rondo, Jim Butler
*  and Dwayne Wade, like certain things.
*  It just seemed like.
*  It would be great if it did work, but the expectation was, OK,
*  this is just this is just treading water at this point.
*  And the specter, like you mentioned, the specter Michael Jordan.
*  Like, yeah, this is just this is just finally getting ready to be the generation
*  that doesn't have that kind of hold outside of the shoes.
*  You know, a lot of people don't want to come here for that kind of smoke.
*  And I don't want you here if you don't.
*  But at the same time, a lot of people we find out that a lot of people
*  don't want that smoke in other cities is probably not going to be readily
*  available for him here in Chicago and be able to be digested properly.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  Like, if we just levitate 40,000 feet away, it's like,
*  how are the bulls not good for 12 years?
*  That's fucking stupid.
*  Hey, 98. I keep saying it.
*  And I say it on my part.
*  Ninety eight is my 85 for years and years and years and years.
*  The 85 Bears ruled not only the nation, but they ruled this town from the moment
*  they were in that Super Bowl on.
*  And I would always look around.
*  And whenever I had a microphone when I was a kid or coming up,
*  I would always ask, like, man, that's a long time.
*  When I went to Atlanta, you know, the fact that they hadn't won a championship
*  in the sport that they love the most, which is college football,
*  since Herschel Walker outside of these last couple where they went crazy
*  with Kirby Smart, it's like certain places you think like, how the hell
*  is this not occurring in a place that loves it this much?
*  Like, what is really at the root of it?
*  And management decisions, you know, sticking with management,
*  treating things like, you know, Jerry Reinsdorf and the Reinsdorf family
*  has always treated their organizations like an insular family kind of situation,
*  even with the minority shares in certain groups.
*  They are they are of the understanding we put people in position to do jobs.
*  But they sometimes, you know, if you're hired by the Reinsdorf's,
*  you've probably got a job for life if you do things to their liking,
*  which are their understanding, if you can explain things.
*  The same thing with the White Sox, you know, and and as I look at it,
*  you know, Gar Foreman and Jon Paxson might have gone on far too long,
*  but they were allowed to make the mistakes and make the the moves
*  that they were allowed to make, along with drafting Jimmy Butler and guys like that.
*  So it was, you know, nothing's linear, right?
*  So it was jagged enough to keep it.
*  But at the same time, in this league where you have to draw in free agents
*  and you have to make things attractive, you look at what Brooklyn did
*  for the longest time, they were sitting there waiting to for somebody
*  to drop into this nest of, you know, the way it come about.
*  And all of a sudden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant show up
*  and they blow up their culture like the Bulls seemingly have been building
*  this thing where it's like, OK, at some point, somebody's going to drop in here.
*  Nobody's dropped in.
*  So you got to you got to stay relevant.
*  You got to keep butts in the seats.
*  And now Zach Lavine and Demar DeRozan are cast with,
*  you know, the expectations of contending.
*  But at the same time, what's your ceiling?
*  There's no shade to them because they're two terrific players.
*  But what's your ceiling when they're the guys?
*  So Bulls fans have found themselves in this kind of cycle for a while now.
*  Well, that's why you're here.
*  More importantly, that's why I'm here.
*  Because I think you need some outside help.
*  I put some real thought into this.
*  What you're going to do for me? Come on.
*  Make my summer better.
*  So this is why I think there's the stealth,
*  most interesting team of the of the offseason.
*  OK, they solve a lot of problems for other teams.
*  Right. But it would require the Bulls going, what are we doing?
*  Let's blow this up.
*  Let's just like, why are we going to pay Vucevic?
*  He's a free agent.
*  Are we really going to extend the Rosen for a couple more years into his mid 30s?
*  He's on this great contract.
*  Why don't we trade him right now?
*  Levine, who's got four years left for big bucks.
*  A lot of teams we just saw with Bradley Beal, like, you know,
*  that's the worst case scenario because he had no trade clause.
*  But if if I was running the Bulls, I would blow it up and start over.
*  And I think he go through some of the teams that need people. Right.
*  Like, let's look at Miami.
*  Everyone's like, well, Dame's going to go to Miami.
*  Is he a repositive?
*  Like, there's a lot of teams that are going to go after Dame.
*  And what happens if Miami doesn't get Dame?
*  Because right now, there are already like basically almost a second apron team.
*  They have Gabe Vincent and they have Strews coming as as, you know,
*  I'm sure they're going to want to resign those guys.
*  And they have Lowry isn't expiring.
*  And the move right now is to trade Lowry for something or Hero for something or both.
*  And like if if if they don't get Dame,
*  why wouldn't they turn Hero into DeRozan or Lowry and some picks into DeRozan?
*  Like DeRozan would be the second call if I knew I wasn't going to get Dame.
*  Right. Then he one more score.
*  And if I'm Chicago, I'm just sitting there like, hey, we'll we'll figure this out.
*  Like if I could turn DeRozan into Hero, I would do that in a heartbeat.
*  That's one team.
*  The the Portland piece of this.
*  As you know, you have this Portland pick and it's top 14 protected until like 2075.
*  It just keeps rolling over year after year after year. Right. Right.
*  But it's bad for Portland because that means they can't put other picks in their trades.
*  Right. So it looks like Dame might stay or they're they're going to go
*  through the facade of him staying.
*  Well, if he's going to stay, they got to trade some stuff.
*  To to to kind of put pieces around him.
*  But you can't do that if you have this protection thing.
*  Well, here are the balls. We'll wave the protection.
*  Well, let's talk deal.
*  You got Simon's, we got DeRozan.
*  We could wave some protection.
*  It's interesting to me that you keep putting DeRozan in these deals.
*  Why aren't you putting Zach Levine in these deals?
*  Oh, I have Zach Cummins. Don't you worry.
*  He's coming after the break.
*  See what the market is looking like.
*  He's coming after the break.
*  But you have also Vusovic.
*  And if like Portland is panicking and they want to win now,
*  couldn't you do a DeRozan Vusovic combo sign and trade, get Simon's back,
*  get a bunch of picks back, take Nurkic's crappy contract back
*  and basically just start over and send both of those guys out?
*  I think the Lanzel Ball piece of this is very, very apparent
*  because I think that our tourist connoisseurs and Mark Eversley
*  saw what that two and a half months before the All-Star break looked like.
*  And that gives them fuel in my estimation.
*  And not that Lanzel's going to come back.
*  Not that Lanzel's going to come back.
*  But if that piece is understood or solved or managed a little bit better,
*  that point guard piece, then this team is different.
*  I mean, Patrick Beverly was on this team when they went 14 and nine down the stretch.
*  And I'm not, trust me, I'm not the guy that's selling all that to you.
*  What I'm telling you is for that to happen.
*  I think that those guys who have been put in full space command
*  by the Reinsdorf and Michael Reinsdorf himself, like he said, hey, these guys,
*  they have been delegated this power.
*  This is what they want to do if that's the case.
*  Right. If they're looking at this as being a point guard away,
*  then the moment you send the guy that you pay two hundred
*  and fifteen million dollars to out after the first year of a five year deal.
*  Yeah, Zach. Then now you're telling everybody, OK, all right,
*  maybe the development plan that we talked about when we got this gig
*  that got thrown out the window the moment you went to go get Boosevich.
*  All right. Maybe the continuity plan that we talked about after we traded for Boosevich.
*  Now that goes out the window because we trade exactly being a DeMar DeRozan.
*  At some point, the clock starts on these guys.
*  And I think they're still trying to figure out if that clock can stay delayed
*  while they're trying to figure out the point guard position themselves.
*  Like, I think the Bulls think that they might, you know, be kicking the tires
*  on some certain players as well.
*  I don't think this is an offload.
*  I think these are two way conversations that are happening around.
*  So you. Yeah, because you mentioned on your pod, you thought they were a stealth
*  Chris Paul destination. Hey, listen, I wanted it for the story alone.
*  Like, I wanted it for the fact that Chris Paul,
*  I think is still good for 20 games during the regular season.
*  And hopefully the 15, 16 that matter in the postseason.
*  But yeah, they need something that that's the reason why Patrick Beverly is calling,
*  you know, Carl Anthony Towns, one of the best players he's ever seen.
*  That's why he's saying that what he's saying about Zach,
*  because he understands that the Bulls are still looking for that point guard
*  position to be filled.
*  And they think that the Miami Heat team to beat them with when they have three
*  minute, 45 second lead in that playing game.
*  I think there's some thinking that they are closer to that than we are.
*  Orlando and Charlotte and all these other teams.
*  Zach Low wrote about this for ESPN this week about what other teams
*  learn from the Heat. Like, was it an aberration or was it repagool?
*  Which I thought was a really good angle.
*  Yeah, if you're the Bulls, do you just watch the tape of that playing game and go,
*  man, oh, that could have been us.
*  I personally think that's insane.
*  Oh, hey, Bill, we're not talking to listen.
*  I am ready for something else.
*  OK, yeah, right.
*  I'm ready for that feeling that I had when and it's going to sound crazy.
*  Like, I remember the baby bulls with Tyson and Eddie.
*  I'm not saying I'm ready for that.
*  What I'm saying is like, I'm ready for that mindset, a reset.
*  And I think that the fan base wouldn't be mad at you at this point.
*  Now, what happens in the building is different, right?
*  The fans don't pay you your salary.
*  The fans don't veto and and accept trade.
*  So what I think is not important here, I thought this thing had reached
*  his ceiling at the end of last year.
*  So, right. Well, the Lonzo piece, it sounds like Lonzo's out for this upcoming season.
*  Oh, no, they've declared him out.
*  Yeah. So they can use there's some sort of injury exception
*  that they could use, like 10 million.
*  But the problem is if they bring Boosevich back and they resign,
*  at least a couple of those guys now, they're close to the second apron.
*  And that's before they would use the extra money to get whatever point card they want.
*  The lines on things really sad.
*  And if you were incredibly early to do a curse of the bulls thing
*  with the Derrick Rose injury, it's been 12 years.
*  But that's fucking weird.
*  Like he goes to the bulls and he gets hurt within two months.
*  And you had there was a moment there.
*  Yeah. That first season when I was like, oh, something's going on here.
*  And then it was over immediately.
*  You know what it felt like?
*  It felt like when I was in Atlanta, when they had the, you know,
*  they would always get out to those starts and Josh Smith would be talked about
*  as an all star.
*  Oh, you know what I mean?
*  And then we get the oh, look, they got three all stars and start
*  and they get all star game or something like that.
*  And it's like, I talk about playoff seasons and start talking about championships.
*  And when it's time to winning time, I think certain certain people excuse themselves.
*  Zach Levine, you've watched him for a couple of years now.
*  Nine seasons, four total playoff games, plus a playing game.
*  Last five years, 25, five and five, basically.
*  Forty eight, thirty nine, eighty four percentage splits.
*  Really good on the books for forty, forty three, forty six.
*  And then a forty nine million dollar player option.
*  He's never probably going to be better than he is now.
*  Do you trade him and what's his market?
*  The market's higher than Bradley Beale because he doesn't have no trade clause.
*  You have teams like, I don't know, the Clippers, if they wanted to put
*  Paul George on the table and mix it up.
*  The Knicks, I'm sure, would want to dive in.
*  Philly, if they want to do a little maxi Tobias Harris.
*  Portland, who we could talk about again.
*  And then Miami would be the other one if they don't get damn.
*  You've watched him.
*  In and out every day.
*  A couple of years now.
*  Can you win a title if he's your second best part?
*  Depends on who your first best player is.
*  If your best player is your kids or one of these five
*  that we talk about all the time, then I believe so.
*  I think you know, I think Zach Rabin is going to settle into.
*  This is no disrespect because this is, I think, one of the highest honors
*  I can give somebody in terms of how I respect this game.
*  You remember Milwaukee, Ray Allen,
*  Milwaukee, Ray Allen, scoring 25 a game, 24 game, catching people at the rim.
*  Super athletic, super agile, had the smoothest handle, terrific shooter.
*  And then he turns into Seattle, right?
*  Whereas is more to extending towards a three point line.
*  Doesn't have to do as much part of that first splash brothers
*  crew with him and Richard Lewis.
*  And then he goes to Boston and then he goes to Miami.
*  And then you see the purest form of this is what Ray Allen is going to do for you.
*  I think Zach Levine's right now.
*  Zach Levine has proved it to himself that he is this good.
*  He's proved it to the rest of the NBA that he is this good.
*  He was on Team USA.
*  All these things have happened now.
*  If Zach Levine starts to look around and he has to play second fiddle
*  Sunday nights, and I'm not saying that this is an issue.
*  But what I'm saying is at the end of the stretch,
*  especially the last 15 games or so of the season, when you knew
*  DeMar DeRozan had that right hip adductor issue.
*  And there was still moments where Zach
*  Levine is getting the ball to DeMar and the end of game situations or, you know,
*  DeMar is the end game decision maker, you know, in terms of ball handling at the.
*  Yeah, that to me, you know, it's kind of like when
*  Lowry and Zach were playing together three years ago.
*  And I never saw a pick and roll pick and fade pick and pop with those guys.
*  Like, hey, man, at some point, you got to figure out if your two best players
*  can play with each other.
*  And now we're at the point where it's like at some point,
*  Zach's not going to be able to iron out these late game decision making issues
*  or these late game shot selection issues if he is not regularly
*  getting those repetitions.
*  So I think Zach right now is everything that you say those numbers say he is and more.
*  I think he's become a better defender.
*  Right now, that now that probably makes him what, an average one?
*  So if you're being kind, but at some point
*  you're going to have to just put the basketball in his hand and say, make all the
*  mistakes. The game will tell you the truth.
*  The game will tell him exactly who he is and who he isn't.
*  But this back and forth ever since DeMar DeRozan has kind of dropped in your lap
*  these last couple of years after being on a free agent market that really wasn't
*  checking for him. He's been on the prove it that I'm DeMar DeRozan.
*  I'm still the dude run.
*  And I'm not mad at that either because that's what's got him here.
*  But at the same time,
*  if we're going to continue to see some of the things that make you scratch
*  your head about Zach and some late game situations,
*  at what point is he going to get a chance to iron those things out?
*  It can't be a pop quiz every night. Right.
*  It's got to be a consistent test.
*  So you're done. You're done with these two as a combo.
*  I think you're at the pick one stage.
*  Yeah. And I think that.
*  I think that you've reached the level that you can, you know,
*  the highest ceiling that you could possibly reach with them.
*  I guess not. It's not a knock on their mishas with those two guys,
*  especially with bouches on the court.
*  Like I've for the last two years, you know,
*  bouches had to change his game demonstrably.
*  So because he gets his points in the same area that DeMar DeRozan gets his,
*  that high elbow, you know, that low that post play like
*  DeMar's not going out there for three.
*  So the way the teams put together and the way that those two guys
*  play off of each other and sometimes don't play off of each other,
*  I think that you've reached your ceiling with this group.
*  And we'll see, because they believe in a continuity
*  and they believe that they haven't had a real chance to play together.
*  Who believes in it?
*  Um, our tourist counter show of Mark Evansley have preached.
*  So the front office believes in it and then the continuity
*  and the ownership is like, we believe it as long as you don't pay the luxury tax.
*  Hey, the message is in the results.
*  Then the message is right there in the results for anybody.
*  It sure is. So.
*  I made up some Levine trades.
*  Oh, and I don't really love any of them.
*  I think he's in a weird spot with the amount of money he makes.
*  But yeah, yeah, it's hard to know Jamal Murray's deal
*  and look at his and be like, man, these two dudes make the same amount of money.
*  Right. Like the owner's going to learn that Max contracts only hurt them.
*  If we talk about true value,
*  like you should be able to pay somebody
*  appreciably more if they are at a different level.
*  And if a person is achieved a different level.
*  And I know there's little caveats in the CBA that bring that along.
*  But to really accentuate it, if I'm making eighty five million dollars
*  and the dude who is similar to me is making forty seven million dollars
*  or sixty million dollars down to the world, then who's really hurting who here?
*  If we're talking about Max value for all these organizations.
*  Yeah, sometimes it's just the situation you were in when that deal
*  became available. Yeah, Jamal was hurt. Yeah.
*  You know, could Miami try to trade for him and do Hero and some picks?
*  That's probably that's a good day in backup.
*  Yeah, I would think that, you know, that or I mean, the New York thing where,
*  you know, I've seen RJ, you'd have to get RJ back, right?
*  RJ Baird, Mitchell Robinson, the pick or something like that.
*  I would I would figure out what you would do with Mitchell Robinson
*  and Vuch on the same roster.
*  But yeah, like Zach, Zach has a few places he could probably drop in.
*  It's just do the bulls want to accept whatever that is coming back?
*  You know, the bulls, the bulls don't really do the tanking rebuild thing.
*  And when they.
*  But it makes more sense for them to have RJ Baird than Zach Levine
*  if they're just going to be in the middle.
*  I'd rather have the guy who's five, six years younger and is less expensive.
*  You know? Yeah, yeah.
*  It gives them that gives them a professional
*  big city face for the NBA.
*  You know, I mean, the things that matter in terms of, you know,
*  the ice in a big dinner theater, if they're not continuing matters still, you know?
*  You see, I think he's.
*  I'm not a gigantic fan, but I'm not against the.
*  I actually think of that of Levine.
*  OK, I think he's weirdly underrated as an asset, though.
*  And it's like the most underrated guy now is Aitin.
*  The Aitin stuff's ridiculous.
*  Like Mark Stein had a thing today in his newsletter that Dallas was going to trade
*  Hardaway and Rashawn Holmes for DeAndre Aitin.
*  But they insisted on including JaVale McGee and Phoenix is like too rich for our blood.
*  And I'm thinking like Dallas, just take DeAndre Aitin.
*  Tim Hardaway and Rashawn Holmes. That's it.
*  That's all it took. What are you guys doing?
*  DeAndre Aitin's good.
*  But he's been like, just I don't know what happened.
*  Levine is like it feels like he's available.
*  He's a 25, five and five guy.
*  But yet there's no like Dame Lowe is on first take every day.
*  Where is he going? Where is he going?
*  There's like no Levine conversation at all.
*  So I don't know where he should be.
*  You know, I think that speaks to the overall relevancy of the bulls, though.
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
*  100 percent. Right.
*  Yeah. Why are we talking about Brandon Ingram?
*  Right. Like if New Orleans can't move Zion and they got to change up
*  that chemistry and they can't move, these are the things where.
*  So Brandon Ingram for Levine.
*  I don't think I'd do that, but I like Ingram more than Levine.
*  That's a good one, though. That's a good fake one.
*  Who do you think who do you think affects winning more?
*  I think Ingram, I really thought Ingram the last couple of months,
*  the last season, I was really impressed.
*  I thought he went up a level.
*  I haven't seen Zach go up a level as like a two way.
*  I'm dragging my team to like a nine and one over 10.
*  You know where you know where is, you know, where is Zach has gone up a level
*  and is so crazy because Will Perdue and Kendall Gill and I talk about this often.
*  He has refined his game so much so we thought we knew he was going to be a scorer.
*  Right. We knew he was going to be athletic.
*  But the fact that he's doing it on the splits that he's doing it, like
*  his his his shot awareness has improved so much so that some of the things
*  that he falters with still, like some of the like I said, late game decision
*  making, there'll be a turnover where you just like what's going on here.
*  Yeah, I've noticed.
*  Yeah. Some of the things that he falters on.
*  Yeah, man. He he I think he's
*  I don't think he's talked about because I don't think the Bulls are talked about
*  on the national stage nearly enough as they should be.
*  And when they were talked about, it was because it was like, hey, look at the Bulls.
*  You know, the number one seed in the East and going into the All-Star break.
*  And then people could settle back because of the injury,
*  could settle back into their normal reflexes when they talk about this
*  organization, which is to not talk about it on a national stage
*  in terms of having attractive players.
*  But I think I think NBA No Man's Land is an exciting for a podcast segment.
*  There's just now don't don't don't get it twisted.
*  I find I find all the absurdities and I laugh at all of them.
*  I listen, I have I have had my Patrick Williams come to Jesus meetings,
*  you know, on a weekly basis during the basketball season.
*  Kind of like I do.
*  They say a full season from him.
*  He puts he's like 21.
*  I do one of those super young guys.
*  You know, it's so crazy.
*  I feel like like I said it to I said it to an Eastern Conference
*  scout the other day. I was like, I had a dream that Patrick Williams woke up
*  and he was the only option, not the number one option,
*  but the only option on the team.
*  Like they the the vooch thing fell through.
*  They trade. Oh, God.
*  It's like full lottery.
*  Just running running ice ice cream with two minutes left.
*  Hey, P.
*  Dove, come get your 24 shots.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Stand out, Jordan Poole out there in D.C.
*  and see who can take the worst shots for the worst team.
*  Well, we're selling.
*  I have a theory that like a hundred guys in the league could score 20 points a game
*  if they were on the right team. Easy, easy, easy.
*  As we'll find out with Jordan Poole on the Wizards next year when he scores 30 again.
*  Hey, hey, Jordan Poole is about to have the time of his life in Chocolate City.
*  He's going to be so happy.
*  This is going to either go really well or really poorly.
*  Either way, it's going to be entertaining.
*  So I centered on Philly.
*  OK. And Harris has an expiring in Maxi.
*  And I think that's too much because I think Maxi, he's young, he's still rookie contract.
*  I think teams really like him.
*  But if you threw Caruso in that trade and that become Harris and Maxi
*  for Levine and Caruso, now I feel like the Bulls are giving up slightly too much.
*  But on the other hand, I kind of like your teamwork,
*  because I think Harris is another guy who's a little undervalued.
*  He's just been standing in the corner for three years.
*  Yeah, I've always liked to buy his hair.
*  So when I first saw him, I thought he would be like a really, really, really poor man.
*  It's Carmelo Anthony in terms of like arc to block scoring.
*  But now he's comparing himself to cookies and all kinds of wild stuff going on.
*  That worries me.
*  The trade speculation. But no, I mean, Tyrese Maxi is is is fun.
*  I thought I picked the 76ers to win the year to get to the finals this year,
*  because I thought he was a sin to being the second best player.
*  You know, what are we talking about?
*  The goal being here for the Bulls?
*  Well, so we talk about jumping into that top four top five,
*  because does that make you better than Cleveland?
*  Does that make you better than Boston?
*  Does it make you better than Philly?
*  Does that make you better than Milwaukee?
*  Like to make a trade and still be messing around with the plane,
*  I think is a thing that scares this organization the most
*  is because of how topsy turvy it is.
*  And those those dudes behind you, the Orlando's and the Indiana's,
*  those those cats catching up to.
*  So are you going to be that much better with those dudes on your team?
*  Like, are you better than Cleveland right now?
*  If Tobias Harris, Tyrese Maxi, Demar DeRose and Patrick Williams
*  and Nikola Vucevich march out there.
*  Well, I mean, the Vuch is a whole other conversation, whether he even comes back.
*  I guess what I would want to power them was a little more flexibility
*  and a little more youth, because they don't extend to Rosen.
*  He leaves as a free agent next year.
*  Now you've lost that asset completely.
*  Vuch, I think it's kind of telling that a lot of teams have cap space.
*  And we're talking about or the ability to create some cap space.
*  We're talking about Draymond and all these other guys.
*  And it doesn't seem like there's a Vuch market at all.
*  And I don't even know.
*  Does Brooke Lopez have a better market than Vuch?
*  He might. He might.
*  Because if you're going 25 million a year for Vuch, I think teams look at that
*  and go, I'd rather pay 50 for Brooke Lopez.
*  Yeah, but Brooke doesn't have to worry about being the top three option on his team
*  and sometimes top two, like because he can't be.
*  So that would be the flip side on Vuch is like, well, I kind of want to see him
*  used like Sabonis was used on Sacramento.
*  That's kind of his destiny, right.
*  And the right team.
*  This was not the right team for him, where he's playing with two like
*  I so heavy dudes, basically.
*  And I don't know. He's the kill the South.
*  He had to change his game.
*  He had to change his game up because of these guys.
*  So part of me wonders, like if they turn Levine and Caruso,
*  Naharis and Maxi and some assets, they kept a Rose and they brought Vucevich back.
*  Do I like that team more?
*  And I kind of landed on yes.
*  And the other one I was looking at was Paul George,
*  but I don't know what the injury history that the Bulls have had over the last 15
*  years, if you want to go down the Paul George rabbit hole.
*  But that's the one where the salaries match up, change the scenery.
*  Levine comes back for the West Coast.
*  That makes some sense.
*  If there's one thing the Bulls fans haven't had to deal with
*  over the last few years is load management.
*  Either your career has been shook up for the worse.
*  Either you're not playing it all out here playing every game.
*  I mean, Pat Williams just played all 82, you know, Zach.
*  The reason why Zach's trade value could and should be high.
*  One of the reasons that I don't think is as talked about as much as it should be
*  is that the NBA got a chance to see him the first year after that knee procedure.
*  And he did the whole load management back to back thing because of the organization.
*  He didn't want to do it, but he did it for the first month.
*  And then he ended up playing with 60 smart games in a row.
*  So he proved to everybody that, hey, I'll be out here for at least 65 of these
*  joints for you because I had this surgery.
*  Not I'm not going to be able to play because my knee isn't working or I'm not
*  feeling good and it's the first year that big deal too.
*  So I think that makes him that much more attractive option as well.
*  So it sounds like you're leaning toward.
*  Trade to pick Zach, basically trade the Rosen.
*  Let Zach build up his value as the number one option
*  on a team where he's now averaging 30 games, something like that.
*  Find some sort of point guard for him.
*  And kind of see where you are in December.
*  Find out what you got.
*  Find out.
*  He'd be more of an asset in December, January, if he's put up 30 a game
*  than he probably is right now.
*  The trade that makes the most sense to me is the Rosen and Simons and the Bulls
*  getting, you know, they relaxed their protections on a pick and get another pick.
*  I do that in the hobby.
*  Dame gets another Dame gets another veteran.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe you figure out a way.
*  Could Vucevich be in that something?
*  But I think having those, that protected pick, which is holding Portland hostage
*  could be used to your advantage.
*  I would do that in the heartbeat.
*  You know why?
*  Because that would make sure that would ensure that the Bulls would not finish
*  last in three point attempts in this modern game.
*  I like Simons.
*  I'd actually, I think to me, that's a no brainer.
*  I think he came in here last year and put 40 on us or something.
*  But yeah, he's there's a lot to be liked.
*  And that was on the top five, top six defense at the time as well.
*  So, you know, he's he's one of those dudes who I feel like if he, if the game
*  teaches him the feel that he needs, then he'll be nice.
*  If not, then, you know, shout out to Monte Ellis.
*  But, you know, it's you know, we'll see another dude who could score at a high
*  clip and not really, you know, refine his game, maybe as much as much as his
*  organization needs him to.
*  But he's another secret young guy too.
*  Yeah.
*  So here's the thing.
*  I think the Bulls are going to be more interesting over the next five days.
*  They are like plan B for all these different teams.
*  Like, oh, Dame's staying.
*  Shit, we got to give them some help.
*  Well, there's not a lot of veterans hanging around ready to be traded.
*  And same for Miami.
