# A New Coach Isnâ€™t Fixing LeBron and the Lakers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRFp4dH0fjQ)
*  This is the toughest.
*  What do you do?
*  Because we already know for a fact that if LeBron and Davis are your two
*  $50 million players, you're not going to compete for an NBA title with that.
*  So we're still with the first question is, do the Lakers care?
*  Do they, do they actually think they could win a title or compete for a title
*  in the league, the way it's going with two different younger generations of players
*  coming and getting better and ascending and being awesome.
*  And you're just going to be a year older with LeBron next year.
*  You got an incredible health season from Davis and none of it
*  mattered and you got bounced in five.
*  What would make you think that there's a magic fix would be my first question.
*  And then the second one is, do you care because you just want to
*  sell out the Staples Center slash crypto?
*  I think having LeBron around and playing as well as you did this past year,
*  being relevant is a much better option than being irrelevant and feeling like
*  you're going to have to get in front of it.
*  Like they should get in front of it.
*  They should say, okay, we need to pivot off of this.
*  We can't have it be, it's going to be a circus, I think even more and
*  more with him at the end.
*  Like, you know, I think, so wait, if we don't make a trade next trade
*  deadline, like you're going to do the same stuff, the, the passive aggressive
*  stuff that he loves to do, I think he's going to get like more insufferable
*  with it as he ages.
*  So I don't know that I'd really want to sign up for that.
*  I'd love to go to him and be like, Hey, can we not pay you the 160?
*  Is there any way that three years from now, there's not a number that destroys
*  us, even though you've, you've done what feels like is impossible for a player
*  at your age, can we not have three years from now be this massive cap number
*  that maybe destroys everything that we're trying to do if he's not willing
*  to play ball with that, you probably still resign him.
*  I don't know if that means that his son also has to be drafted.
*  Uh, there's just a lot of stuff that I don't know that I'd want to do, but
*  being in LA and being relevant and the way front offices will be like, Hey,
*  bounce here, bounce there.
*  You know, we got a bad matchup in the first round and all this stuff.
*  Like at least we know 24, 25.
*  Like we probably have a pretty good, right?
*  Yeah.
*  We have a pretty good team and we'll have a better coach and a tweak here
*  and a tweak there.
*  We're not playing reddish and we're not doing Jackson Hayes things.
*  And we, we get better depth there.
*  Like, you know, that's what teams are going to end up doing with
*  everyone in these scenarios.
*  We were all here in the mid 2010s when they were not relevant, the mid to that,
*  like when that 2014 season 15, 16, they were rough and everyone's like, the
*  Quippers are going to take over.
*  It's going to be the Quippers town.
*  Didn't even come close to happening.
*  And people still went to Laker games.
*  So in some ways it's like Fenway park in the Red Sox where they're like,
*  Hey, our team sucks now.
*  And people are like, cool.
*  I still like going and drinking beer and sitting in the stands then does it
*  matter if the Lakers aren't relevant from a competitive standpoint?
*  I don't think it does.
*  See, I was actually thought you were going somewhere else.
*  See, I think those years are actually the worst nightmares of Lakers fans.
*  I think we think that when the Lakers fans think about the Lakers, that
*  they're thinking about the recently that they're thinking about magic
*  Johnson and Shaq and Kobe, they're really thinking about Robert Sockery.
*  They're thinking about those big shop.
*  Bob years.
*  They're thinking of those medium shot.
*  Those last years and how Jody Meeks, Jody Meeks, Andrew Goulock, like all,
*  all, like all of those guys, they're thinking about those years.
*  And if you push them, they'd rather be right where they are right now between
*  an eight and a six seat with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
*  They really rather have something dramatic in the illusion of hope.
*  Oh, we might get to John Tate Murray.
*  Oh, Jimmy Butler might come trade like Trey Young, whatever it is.
*  But that's the thing.
*  I think now they're better presented.
*  Sorry to jump you in, but like as we're talking all this out, we should have led
*  with there's still a really good opportunity with the assets now to make
*  some kind of impactful trade where it's like, why would we even think of breaking
*  this up? We added a real third piece beyond DeAngelo Russell, who again, was
*  terrific in the second half of the season.
*  So go ahead and off on the playoffs and off on the playoffs and the coach got
*  blamed for everything somehow, which we haven't talked to you, which we'll
*  get to that. But like there at least has to be a circus to go to.
*  There has to be a circus that happens.
*  There has to be a circus.
*  It feeds everything. It feeds the L.A.
*  media machine. It feeds what's happening on ESPN radio.
*  It feeds all of that when there's nothing to talk about with the Lakers.
*  We're talking about 14, 15, 20 wins.
*  The city is down too much. They don't want to go back to that.
*  And I think that part of what the management there is going to do is to make sure
*  that those days don't come around again.
*  So you're going to pay LeBron.
*  You're going to hope that Anthony Davis, who had fantastic season, can can stay
*  upright and you're going to build around him until he limps off the court.
*  That's what I think they're going to do.
*  I went back and read about LeBron's first Laker season, which I think.
*  Has been remembered a different way than what actually happened.
*  Huh? No, because I was I want to do a little research for the pod.
*  I was trying to figure out all the times the trade deadline fucked up their team.
*  Because it's been a recurring theme with the Lakers and it starts with 2019, his
*  first year, they were actually pretty, pretty good for the first part of that
*  year. Like they beat Golden State on Christmas.
*  They had a winning record.
*  He got hurt and he missed like a month.
*  And right around late January, as he's coming back, that was when Anthony Davis
*  made the trade request to New Orleans.
*  And that's when all the stuff started coming out about.
*  He's rich.
*  Paul is telling these teams like Boston, whoever, like if you trade for him, he's
*  leaving the year.
*  It was basically like, he's going to the Lakers.
*  So we can either do this now or we can do this later.
*  And if you remember, and you can go back and read all the articles, the team
*  imploded after that, because leading up to the trade deadline, everyone thought
*  they're going to be traded.
*  It came very close to being a trade.
*  Then it didn't happen.
*  And then it was the wreckage of the non-trade.
*  And the team fell apart.
*  LeBron played post trade deadline.
*  He played the rest of that season.
*  He wasn't like, oh, he got injured and he didn't come back.
*  He was playing.
*  They were, he was out there with Rondo and Kyle Kuzma and Caldwell Pope and, uh,
*  Lonzo Ball, all those dudes.
*  Um, but the trade deadline murdered the team.
*  And that's been like, when I think about LeBron, big picture, I'm always surprised
*  that after all these years, that he's been the best guy on a team and one of the
*  most famous athletes in the world, that he doesn't see the cause and effect of
*  stuff, right?
*  Like if, if you, if you're just every year, you're the trade rumor candidate or
*  one of the two or one of the three, and then it's going to affect how you play.
*  And if you think, oh, well, I'm dispensable, I could be out of there.
*  I just think this, when you talk about a circus fan, that's the part I don't
*  see getting better for the other guys.
*  How do you win if you're on this team?
*  No, I told you before the biggest criticism of LeBron's legacy isn't any
*  disappearing acts on the fourth quarter.
*  Isn't it?
*  Is that there's absolutely zero stability to me and playing with him or being a
*  part around, I've been around him.
*  Like you're constantly, if you're with some of these other guys, these true
*  alpha number ones that we've seen, there's coaching stability there.
*  They make coaches into legends.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They do.
*  You get four or five, six, seven, eight years or run of them with LeBron.
*  Doesn't matter what it is, how good he is as a coach.
*  You're always looking over your shoulder as a player.
*  You're always looking over your shoulder because he is so good that there's no
*  ownership that gets thrown on him for anything.
*  It must be the coach.
*  It must be the supporting cast.
*  So if you, if you come into that, if you opt into that, that's going to be a
*  part of your existence.
*  If you look at like, I just hate playing the nuggets because I hate watching
*  KCP just fucking succeed.
*  Like I just, I hate watching like you, you watch Malik Monk, you watch guys that
*  have come there and did the rest.
*  Malik Monk was, yeah, you, you, well, I mean, Caruso, that was an abomination
*  losing Caruso.
*  It was like a terrible situation for us.
*  But anyway, I won't drone on, but I'll say like for LeBron, that's a part of it.
*  He is such a gigantic presence.
*  And he is completely incapable from the fan base, sometimes from himself and
*  from management of taking any sort of responsibility for when things go wrong,
*  that it will fall on somebody else.
*  And it'll be either the coach or the supporting cast that didn't get it done
*  so that he could go on and succeed.
*  Yeah.
*  Rossello, like if we left that game five nugget series and LeBron gives an
*  interview after, and he goes, you know what?
*  I, we were really close to that team.
*  And I think we can beat that team.
*  And I actually liked the nucleus we have and I want them to bring back
*  Darwin Ham and you know what?
*  I missed a wide open three that could have won game five and that's on me.
*  But I think these guys deserve a chance.
*  I think we deserve a chance to run it back.
*  Everyone had been like, Whoa, where'd that come from?
*  It's just the moment the series is over is like, Oh, here comes Darwin Ham.
*  And then it's 50, 50 whether Polinka gets blamed too.
*  And then, you know, D-Low is either out or in a trade.
*  And it's just like the same rinse, rinse, lather, repeat cycle.
*  And I don't know.
*  I just don't think it works anymore.
*  I think it works when you're the best player in the, in the
*  world, but he's not anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing is the partnership was.
*  Well, I don't see, I think that's always been the thing is he's never really
*  been a partner, he's been like a subcontractor and when the results, when
*  the results got you an NBA finals appearance, you're like, I don't care.
*  I don't care if this guy's not a W two.
*  Like, what do I care?
*  But as it goes further and you go, so, so what do we have to do here?
*  We got to give you 160 million.
*  We got to draft your son.
*  You're going to pick out another coach and we got to trade all of our future
*  picks that were allowed to trade for probably a B minus guy.
*  Um, but I think the fans original point, they went six years
*  without sniffing the playoffs.
*  This is probably still a better option than what your assets are.
*  Like that's, that's just always, whenever I look at these teams, they're okay.
*  But these guys will spend hours and hours and hours on all these hypothetical
*  things, would you take this guy for that guy?
*  You know, that's like front office, just sit around constantly being like, you
*  think this guy's better, this guy, who'd you rather have now, who'd you rather
*  have in three years, they do it with like everybody in the league nonstop.
*  It's like the number one podcast.
*  I know.
*  I know they just hate it.
*  I want to be one of those offices, but there's just so many times where you go
*  like, I wouldn't do that.
*  I wouldn't do that.
*  I wouldn't do that.
*  I wouldn't do that.
*  You know?
*  And so, and with LeBron, I wouldn't want to give him the third year on all this
*  stuff.
*  I'd love for it to be a team option.
*  He's not, he's probably not going to agree to that unless it's less money and
*  it's a, it's a player option for the third.
*  I don't, I don't know, but it's probably better.
*  And also what kind of coach or van who.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  I did a joke on, on YouTube about, I thought that LeBron should be the
*  player coach that, that, that was a great move for Ray.
*  It's also illegal.
*  You can't do it in the click to bargain.
*  You're a minute, but it's a great move for so many reasons.
*  One of which was it would be if they somehow really did well with him as the
*  player coach, little feather in the cap and the, and the MJ argument, right?
*  MJ never coached himself.
*  Russell won two titles coaching himself.
*  This could be like, I think for LeBron, but like they mentioned some of the
*  names, like, oh, you could see this guy.
*  Maybe it's JJ Reddick.
*  It's like, JJ would have to be a lunatic to take the Lakers job.
*  I can't imagine.
*  You don't think that JJ, you don't think JJ would take the job in a second.
*  How much money?
*  I mean, is it like a crazy amount of money?
*  They, they could have wine and talk about, you know, Ram screen.
*  I think he's set up to fail with that job because he's got the preexisting
*  relationship with LeBron.
*  How are you going to coach him at that point?
*  And also what, who am I coaching?
*  What's my style going to be?
*  Like who, who is the right coach for this team?
*  I have no idea at this point.
*  We're so, who's the right coach for them?
*  How many coaches could actually take that Lakers roster and do well?
*  I thought Vogel did a good job in the bubble.
*  Within a year he was fucking out.
*  You know, I, Darvin Ham, I didn't think, I didn't think he was a very good coach.
*  I don't think he was better or worse than 20 guys.
*  I watched her in the season and he did some weird shit.
*  I thought some of his rotations were weird.
*  End of the games.
*  I wouldn't say he was Mr.
*  Adjustment, but I, I don't think he's the reason they under achieved.
*  I thought they properly achieved.
*  I found the Vogel one really frustrating because it was like, as soon
*  as things started going south, started hearing the, well, you know, we're starting
*  to learn Frank isn't that great of a coach.
*  You're like, all right.
*  Yeah.
*  Like serious.
*  You win the title.
*  Really?
*  And then it's like, okay, now we get Darvin Ham in here.
*  Now.
*  So it's not even about like what I thought about Ham this year, because I
*  think there's probably a lot of stuff you could point to with this rotations of
*  the timeline of like, Hey, you tried this guy too much, you went with this guy
*  too long, but it's also something to be said of like the front office.
*  Remember when Polinka signs all of these recognizable names, but there's a
*  reason why Jackson Hayes is on a minimum.
*  There's a reason why cam Reddish is available again.
*  Christian.
*  When there's right Christian would have all, it's like, Hey, he's on his eighth
*  team now, but no, he's going to be awesome here.
*  And when you have that many guys that all think they're supposed to play, but
*  they're all kind of minimum guys.
*  People were saying the Lakers won the off season when it's like, well, they
*  just added a bunch of people that everybody knows who they are.
*  I liked when they had, when they got Vincent and Prince, I was like, Oh, these
*  are two guys that could play in a playoffs series, and then they just kept
*  adding people and then by the time they got to Christian, I'm like, what is it?
*  Like 20 guys on the team.
*  That's it was never healthy.
*  So that's unfortunate.
*  And no, they bench Reeves who's their third best player.
*  They yanked him around for two months.
*  And then the Rui thing.
*  So I do think there's things you could point to for him.
*  I just had an issue of when all of a sudden overnight Vogel was bad and
*  Ham was the solution when I don't know that there's any, I don't think there's
*  anybody in a front office that would be like, we think Ham today is a better
*  head coach than Frank Vogel is even then, you know, for them to think that a new
*  coach is going to push them in a much better direction, I think is insane.
*  I just, but I think it's insane.
*  I think once again, though, when you look at it, if you just, if you, obviously
*  we watched the game, so we see the deficiency that Darwin Ham has, but if
*  you just took a step back and looked at it on paper, he went to the West finals
*  in his first year and then they made the playoffs in the second year, you'd say,
*  Hey, that's a guy that maybe we should give a little bit of rope to.
*  So to see whether or not he knows what it is he's doing.
*  But no, the reality is as soon as it starts going bad and soon as a narrative
*  builds in a town that is expert at creating narratives, some movie town.
*  So they create the narrative.
*  I'm not saying that Darwin Ham was, he was, I was very frustrated with him.
*  But what I'm saying is that's the type of situation that the
*  coach is going to walk into is going to walk into a, um, um, a spot where your
*  star player is in a lot of ways, infallible to where the roster is built to suit that
*  player and to where, when everything goes wrong is going to be your fault and what
*  you're not doing right and how you're not getting it right.
*  So as far as a coach that can handle that, um, the only reason why that I joke about
*  the JJ thing is because you'd almost need someone that didn't have much that
*  that had a lot of tread on the tires.
*  You need somebody that was, was, was invigorated enough by the
*  opportunity to take some shit.
*  Well, this was the case for Steve Nash and Brooklyn though.
*  I mean, that's that part where it's made.
*  I just like, I don't think people realize both in, in real life and in business and
*  pick an industry, but especially in sports, the whole concept of job preservation.
*  And like, you look at like an NBA GM who's with the owner all the time and
*  talking to the owner all the time.
*  Right.
*  And things aren't going as well as you thought.
*  You're spending a lot of money in this team.
*  You had all these free agent signings and it's just not going as great.
*  You're trying to keep your job.
*  What do you start doing the moment things aren't going that great?
*  Like, I don't know what the fuck ham's doing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  The rotations.
*  It's like, you know, I don't want to throw them under the bus, Jeannie, but God,
*  I don't know what he's doing with Rui.
*  And you're just, you're just planting the seeds left and right.
*  Then you're talking to pick a Lakers reporter.
*  Hey, what's going on at the Lakers?
*  What's happening there?
*  It's like, we're off the record, right?
*  I mean, ham's just been, and you just, you're just planting seeds all over the
*  place because then ham's the fall guy for if this goes badly, cause ham's now gone.
*  Vogel's gone.
*  But Poinque has been there the whole time for six years, you know, and basically
*  did the AD trade, the Reeves thing was great, but I think he made some real
*  mistakes in the last year, like most, the biggest one, Rossello for me is like, if
*  you know, you have an older team, like now that we know what Hockes is and that he
*  was a finished product, why would you take a 19 year old rookie point guard?
*  Who's clearly just a trade asset and that's it over somebody who could have
*  actually helped you.
*  Cause Hockes didn't shoot it well enough for three of the four years he was at UCLA.
*  That's why he lasted.
*  What about Podzemski?
*  Well, could you have gotten somebody with that pick who could actually play?
*  I don't like that game.
*  I don't like that game.
*  I don't like the game when somebody goes that late and then all of a sudden
*  everybody just goes, oh, this team should have taken him.
*  When it's like 20 teams passed.
*  I'm just talking mindset of what do you want from that pick when your
*  star player is 39 years old?
*  Do you want somebody who's going to be good three years from now or somebody
*  who could help you right away?
*  I get your point, but I mean, if you're sitting there at that pick with
*  Huchafino and you're like, Hey, this guy's got a lot of size, he's a combo
*  guard.
*  It's kind of what's prioritized.
*  Like, you know, there's a pretty good chance where every draft is going to play
*  anyway.
*  So yeah, I mean, everybody wants to get mad at everybody for not taking Hockes
*  and Hockes immediately.
*  You were like, okay, Miami did it again.
*  They figured it out when they don't even care about their draft picks.
*  Historically Hockes didn't shoot well enough.
*  And Podzemski was going to be a tough sell for different front offices.
*  Cause they're really like, wait, six, five.
*  And what's, what's the deal with this guy?
*  Like, is this real?
*  And explain Christian Wood then.
*  Uh, everybody falls for Christian Wood.
*  Christian Wood.
*  Everybody has to have a
*  Winona rider in the nineties.
*  It's like, it's, I'm going to be different.
*  It's gotta happen.
*  Winona took me home last night and this is serious.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I look forward to-
*  Go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  No, he's a pro typical player to fall in love with.
*  You put him in at 2k and then like you run him up and he's a pro.
*  He looks, he sells the story every single game.
*  I'm like, Oh my God, Christian Wood is going to figure it out for the Lakers.
*  And he just, he's Christian Wood on a bad plate.
*  Let's see.
*  He's a, he's a, everybody falls in love with him.
*  He looks like he's got everything he needs to be able to score and do the whole
*  nine and then it just kind of doesn't happen.
*  Whatever that extra thing is, he doesn't have it.
*  Scott once told me no team has been upset when he left.
*  It's a good one.
*  And my favorite thing with Christian Wood is when he's on the next new team
*  and he hits a bunch of threes, then the local beat guy starts writing about like,
*  look at these numbers, look at his board, look at his wind shares, look at his
*  spacing and look at all these different things.
*  And it's like, yeah, okay, cool.
*  Got it.
*  Awesome.
*  I don't know what the fix is.
*  And I think it's not a coach.
*  The coach isn't going to change any of this.
*  Yeah, it certainly seems like now there is no fix, but, but the fix could, no,
*  the fix could be raising their ceiling, doing something here.
*  They're probably going to package all the picks up if they do the LeBron signing,
*  which they're probably going to do.
*  Cause I do think he wants to go here, despite the flirtation with the other
*  places, unless he decides he's just going to play for less money, try to get a fifth
*  ring, but I think he really wants to be in LA still.
*  There's a lot of stuff that those guys are doing as a whole reason coming out
*  here in the first place.
*  And you know, if they're going to do that, then it probably means they're also
*  going to trade those picks and maybe they trade their picks and it gets worked in a
*  way with clutches power where all of a sudden it's like, holy shit, like they
*  got that guy, like they got the advantage because they talk one of the players that
*  they have a great relationship into the same way that AD ended up with the Lakers.
*  Like maybe there's this next piece that we're not even thinking about that makes
*  the Lakers like, Hey, the LeBron investment thing, just stay with it because that's a
*  hell of a lot better.
*  Maybe fighting for a best case scenario, five or six seed in a stacked West.
*  That's better than the unknown of getting aggressive with overhauling it and moving
*  on from him.
*  Is that's the fix.
*  The fix is a narrative change.
*  The fix is not Lakers.
*  The Lakers championship or bus team, the fix is Lakers.
*  Are we Sacramento?
*  Like that's like that.
*  That's the fix.
*  The fix is a new, the faces, the Lakers come out and have fun at crypto.
*  And it's LeBron.
*  That that's the fix.
*  The fix is a change in what you think.
*  Cause it's like you look at Denver and you look at Oklahoma City and you look at,
*  it's not going to happen.
*  It's over.
*  Denver, OKC, Minnesota and Boston with young, deep, awesome rosters and star
*  players in their prime whose errors are pointing up or are at the peak of their
*  powers.
*  It's over.
*  And it's going to be about three years that Wimby going to be putting in it.
*  It's so is that could be one year.
*  It's going to take at least three.
*  They got to be, it could be two years.
*  So you think you're saying the Lakers are basically like Yellowstone season 11.
*  Absolutely.
*  The Lakers are like everything else, everything else in LA, a lot of money, a
*  money grab.
*  Right.
*  It's like everything else in LA is a lot of fun, but the Lakers are the current
*  state of the MCU.
*  You just hope you get a good one, but you know, things aren't going the way you
*  want them to.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So just have fun watching basketball because I think the championship
*  aspirations of this iteration of the Los Angeles Lakers, I think they're, I think
*  they're pretty much over and just marvel at watching LeBron doing what he's doing
*  at his age.
*  But the whole town gets girded up over what could happen when this was
*  essentially this was a playing team.
*  We know they don't have their pick next year because I think New Orleans is
*  going to pass.
*  They have that pick between 24 and 25.
*  Yeah.
*  But that was the thing is once they knew what New Orleans was doing, then they
*  have the freedom.
*  So it wasn't so much of like, Hey, we have their trade.
*  They're trading that in there.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  They're not going to be tanking and be like, you know what?
*  It's a reboot.
*  Great draft.
*  We're trade everybody.
*  Most of these teams that, that we're talking about, like they actually can't
*  even tank on top of everything else.
*  Yeah.
*  They figured out, they figured out how to, uh, how to kill tanking by having
*  every team trade five of their next seven first round picks across the board.
*  Yeah.
*  I just, there's two things.
*  One, I don't know why somebody would want to coach this Lakers team unless it was
*  just an absurd amount of money.
*  There's no other reason.
*  And let's, let's just not rule out.
*  Like if you're throwing out the JJ Rettig thing, like a lot of athletes, like
*  the Lakers are asking you to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.
*  That's a tough thing to say no to.
*  That's a tough thing to say no to.
*  So everything that we just talked about, like all valid stuff, but that moment of
*  like getting off the phone and turning to your wife and being like, I have right
*  now, I can be the head coach of the fucking Lakers.
*  There's just a lot of people that.
*  Right.
*  I'm going to get fired in two and a half years.
*  By the way, the way some of these guys get fired now with the money,
*  you might as well just do it.
*  By the way, how, how bummed do you think my, I have not talked to him
*  about this, how bummed do you think my guy doc is?
*  Cause this would have been the job, right?
*  Do TV for a year, slide right into the Lakers, stay in LA would have been perfect.
*  Instead he goes to Milwaukee injuries galore.
*  I don't know.
*  Did not work.
*  But look, I'll say this being the coach of the Lakers.
*  It, it, it raises your profile for everything else.
*  Really?
*  Cause I saw Luke Walton on the Cavs bench.
*  He was like, cabs assistant number four with a sad look on his face.
*  So I don't know.
*  Not positive.
*  That's true.
*  Anywhere.
*  But if Luke Walton wanted to go do TV or if he wanted to, if there were other
*  interests that he had his time as Lakers coach would be a certainly an asset in
*  that other type of career.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Uh, you know, the only thing that success is what breach.
*  He also had a tough state up North.
*  So all of that stuff goes into it with Luke's career.
*  You brought up Luke.
*  That's Dan.
*  Can you?
*  Can you, um, give us a sense, big picture where LeBron stands in the Lakers fan
*  base, um, from a beloved Lakers standpoint, given some of the competition with the big
*  names, how do they feel about him?
*  Anecdotally, when you, you have a bunch of Laker fans in your life, including
*  a, our guy, Joe me, how are they feeling about LeBron as, as he heads into his
*  forties?
*  Um,
*  I can't really speak for them because I think once you put on the purple and
*  gold, a lot, uh, a lot of, they, I think the Laker fans fall in line.
*  Um, I do still think the specter of Kobe Bryant looms large over LeBron James's
*  legacy in Los Angeles.
*  And I think the title, uh, is a title, you know, it's NBA players playing against
*  NBA players, but at the same time, it is a bubble title.
*  It is kind of one of those things to where you'd argue LeBron James when a
*  ring in LA, but does it feel like he's achieved?
*  Right.
*  With no home games in LA.
*  Yeah.
*  No parade in LA.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like one of those kind of frustrating things to me.
*  And this is not, uh, me being super pithy or trying to throw out a name because
*  I'm not alleging anything.
*  I think LeBron is as much of a Laker as Alex Rodriguez was a Yankee.
*  Interesting.
*  So this, there's a, a DNA to the culture of these types of, of, of, uh, of
*  historic franchises and I think Rick Fox is more of a Laker than LeBron James is.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, I think, I think there is not, you can't fame your way into it.
*  There has to be something genuine about it.
*  And LeBron James to the Lakers.
*  It doesn't feel like very culturally authentic.
*  Well, you know, you know how he could flip that though?
*  How?
*  He just said, I'm ending my career in the Lakers.
*  I'm not going anywhere.
*  And I want to play here until I can't play anymore.
*  I love it here.
*  I love LA.
*  And if we want a fifth title for me, that would be ideal, but either way, I'm a Laker.
*  This is where I want to retire.
*  I love this franchise.
*  He's always kind of left the door open.
*  I don't know.
*  We'll see.
*  And I do think that's part of it.
*  You know, cause you kind of know if, if, if your, if your best player is one foot
*  out, out the door, which I don't think he does, but I don't think he has
*  both feet in the door either.
*  Well, when he signed a longer term contract, as soon as he left Cleveland
*  after doing one plus ones all the time, Cleveland was like, seriously, dude,
*  it's like, great.
*  So he was actually more committed to LA than he had been in the other
*  place the previous eight years.
*  So, uh, look, living out here and being somebody that's, that's not from here.
*  I've noticed there's Lakers fans that certainly are Kobe fans or Kobe fans
*  that are not Lakers fans.
*  And it's such a large group of like this Laker fandom where they're just kind
*  of insufferable Kobe people.
*  Like, here's an example.
*  Denver, LA the other night.
*  Uh, I think I had already watched, I don't know, seven hours after 10
*  hours the day before I was like, my man needs to get in the ocean.
*  I need to read about captain cook and I'm going to spend an hour at the beach.
*  Even though the Lakers and nuggets are tipping off right now, I will be able
*  to make it back up a little bit later.
*  I need a break.
*  I need to get out of the house for a little bit.
*  Walk down to the beach.
*  Beautiful day.
*  Kobe jerseys everywhere and the game's tipping off.
*  All right.
*  And then that's, and then that's the guy that wants to argue with you about
*  Kobe being better than LeBron.
*  I know some people are listening right now being local.
*  That's because he is.
*  I would disagree.
*  It's unfair for LeBron.
*  The a rod comp is great.
*  LeBron has never had anything close to as embarrassing as a rods run at the end of
*  his Yankees tenure, which was just, was just, and I know that's not what you're
*  saying, so I'm not even disagreeing with you, but Derek Jeter is there.
*  And that's right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But like a rod was also better than Derek Jeter Lakers fans got LeBron year 16.
*  So LeBron was never going to be as a non-homegrown guy with only one title and
*  nothing really to show for other than the Western conference finals last year.
*  Like you're just never going to be able to do it, but somehow these Kobe fans
*  look at year 16 on and they're like, yeah, my guy, Kobe was better than him.
*  It's like, well, I don't even know if you're at the, you're, you're playing
*  volleyball right now, not watching the Lakers against the nuggets, but you're
*  going to tell me you're the expert on who LeBron was before he showed up to LA.
*  That stuff to me is like, so unfair for the LeBron part of it.
*  And I think being here, I was at the gym and there was two guys and they're huge
*  Lakers fans and they were, they were, I was like, you guys upset, they'd just
*  been eliminated and they were like, Kobe would've never let that happen.
*  And I went, yeah, he might've been swept.
*  Like seriously guys, are you serious?
*  And that's, that's how those guys feel.
*  And again, my opinion is different.
*  I get it.
*  This is what I'd say though.
*  Number one, I don't think LeBron cares that much about where he falls into the
*  Lakers lore.
*  I think the move here was about, I don't think he cares at all.
*  I don't think he cares.
*  Yeah.
*  So the Kobe's unsolvable.
*  First of all, the Kobe, you want to talk about the Jordan LeBron thing?
*  The more decided factions are the Kobe LeBron.
*  Yeah, that he lost that early.
*  Is it, there's no way he wins it.
*  Like Kobe, like Kobe was at least able to make us feel like he desperately cared
*  about being a Laker and everything that came with being a Laker, even though he
*  flirted with going other places as well and strong arm the organization and the
*  whole nine LeBron's move out here was very calculated.
*  It was very calculated.
*  So the only thing that would endear him to Lakers fans would just be straight up
*  dominance.
*  It would just be straight.
*  What happens on the court?
*  Because he didn't come in, like you say, in the, in the, the middle of his prime
*  he came in at the end of it.
*  So it was like, okay, for LeBron to become a Laker, he's going to have to put up
*  wins and championships and do all of that stuff.
*  And the frustrating thing is he kind of did, but it doesn't feel like he did.
*  He is a Laker, but it doesn't feel like he's a Laker.
*  You got him year 16.
*  The season he just had the Western conference finals.
*  Yeah, there was a gap, but you also got a title and this, you know how much worse
*  this could have gone.
*  Do you know how bad and if LeBron doesn't come here, by the way, ad doesn't come
*  here.
*  So, right.
*  They couldn't get any free agents anymore.
*  I mean, they did give away all of their picks and assets for like 10 years,
*  basically for that credit.
*  But they got a title.
*  Was it too much?
*  No, we should revisit.
*  Lonzo.
*  They gave five first round picks.
*  Josh Hart.
*  Like, there was a lot of people in those trades.
*  Lonzo to be signing on to LeBron in 2018 and get this.
*  Step back and have more perspective on what this was.
*  This was a massive success.
*  And, you know, there's going to be people going like, it's not Kobe.
*  Like, all right, the COVID year took so many basketball victims from it.
*  Like I feel the same way with the Clippers.
*  Like we were headed.
*  Remember we were doing podcasts because we had just started picking up again.
*  And it felt like Lakers versus Clippers.
*  Finally, this is happening.
*  And that was probably the best, healthiest version of the Clippers that we've had.
*  The Lakers, they're both playing great.
*  They're probably the two best players in the league.
*  And it was just heading that way.
*  And then all of a sudden we're playing in a bubble and that's how we decided
*  this season, but I do feel like that was a piece of this because LeBron was
*  awesome that year.
*  You know, and the team was really good and they were fun to watch.
*  And I think he needed one season where the team was awesome and they win.
*  And then maybe he becomes a Laker in a different way.
*  I think he still is.
*  The scoring record helped.
*  But when I go to the games, I'm always surprised by the Kobe jerseys
*  compared to everybody else.
*  It's like, it's noticeable.
*  But once again, I don't know that I guess you could say the Cavs.
*  I don't know if I, LeBron James has almost transcended connection to a team.
*  Right.
*  He's his own team almost.
*  He's his own thing.
*  He's transcended that like LeBron James is a Cleveland Cavalier.
*  There's some stories.
*  LeBron James is a Heat.
*  There are some things there.
*  It's kind of a whole mercenary thing, the decision.
*  I don't think that the way he's mapped his career out and the way he's executed
*  it, that he could be a part of any team's culture.
*  He's probably too big for that.
*  Even the Lakers who have probably the biggest culture in the NBA.
*  I don't think he's a part of it.
*  I don't think he could be a part of any of those teams.
*  Cause maybe he's a little bit a part of all of them and not just
*  encompassed in all of them.
*  You're right.
*  Okay.
*  You're right.
*  Like if you wanted the Kobe love, if you wanted all that, then you stay in
*  Cleveland the entire time, but that's not the way he was going to operate.
*  But when I get into whatever disagreements I get with the random person that I
*  see every day, you know, that knows what I do and they're pissed off about the
*  Lakers and they're so pissed off about LeBron all the time.
*  And I'm getting back to my original point being like, do you know how bad this
*  could have been if he didn't come here?
*  Like, do you guys have bad you were doing with free agents?
*  Do we, do we have to go over the history of all this stuff?
*  And he picked you, right.
*  He picked you when you didn't really even have the support plan even in place.
*  And you still got a title out of this.
*  And I had a neighbor who was like, he's no Kobe.
*  And I went, I looked at the person and went, yeah, we agree.
*  He's not.
*  And the person was kind of like, wait, did we just agree or did he kind of just
*  quietly tell me to fuck off?
*  It's certainly a, it's a weird basketball situation in the sense that I can't
*  explain it to anybody who doesn't live here.
*  I would have never understood it.
*  I would have, I would be like, what?
*  Completely un-understandable.
*  You have to be in it every day and see how beloved Kobe is.
*  And LeBron just has felt like the hired gun for some reasons.
*  So then you see stuff like this week and people, you know, this was some of
*  the newspaper coverage about it, where people are like, this guy that now
*  there's another fall guy, like when is this guy going to have accountability?
*  Now we have to go through this whole dance again.
*  It's been six years of it.
*  And I think, I don't know, I'm feeling some fatigue van.
*  I get it.
*  Let me tell you how much the recognition of Kobe has meant to me in LA.
*  First of all, I've always been a Kobe guy, big time Kobe guy.
*  But when I first moved out here, it was 2006 and they were telling me about this
*  big black versus Mexican thing that was happening in the streets.
*  All right.
*  Eduardo Navarro?
*  It is in the streets.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  You know, I'm in the streets.
*  It was bad.
*  Snoop ended up making songs about it.
*  They had Snoop and B-Real had to come together and make records to get rid of.
*  And so, you know, I move out to Van Nuys and I'm living in the communities around
*  a lot of my Mexican Latino brothers and sisters, but I never know how it's going
*  to go.
*  I'm coming from Louisiana.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I don't know what's going to happen.
*  So, you know, some of the brothers, the Mexican brothers out there, they look
*  different tattoos and the whole nine and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And it's like all in the face and whatever.
*  I'm like, you know, I don't know if they're going to think I'm with somebody
*  and just going on.
*  I remember one specific time I'm walking down Sherman Way.
*  It's like nine thirty, ten o'clock at night.
*  And I see somebody and this dude is out of central casting for somebody that's
*  going to look for the beef.
*  This is one of those motherfuckers that's at the table with Lonzo and training
*  day. You know, it's one of those guys, one of the shit pusher inners type of.
*  And he's walking.
*  I'm getting all, what's going to have to happen?
*  I'm profiling the shit out of this motherfucker.
*  I think I'm so woke, but it happens.
*  And so like as he as he as he comes towards me, I see something.
*  This motherfucker has a Kobe jersey.
*  I'm fucking safe.
*  The love of Kobe transcends all cultural lines, all whatever everything.
*  When I see him with the Kobe jersey on, I know that there's something there that
*  me and him feel the same about.
*  He walks past me and I go black mamba.
*  He goes black fucking mamba and say walks down the street with dope.
*  That's how much Kobe meant to this town.
*  He is first of all, great story.
*  Second of all, I've been here 22 years.
*  And he is by far the most popular celebrity since I've been here.
*  It's not even close.
*  I don't even know who's to.
*  I always thought it was a magic town and Kobe just took it in a really crazy way.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Kobe has the shoes that definitely speak to a younger generation.
*  You know, I don't see people kicking LeBron's around as much.
*  I mean, the Kobe thing, when you turn on an NBA game, half the
*  players are wearing his shoes.
*  I mean, I think that's like a remarkable carryover for his legacy, but I
*  couldn't help but think about you, Bill.
*  I couldn't think about, I couldn't stop thinking about home in Massachusetts
*  where when I walked down to the beach minutes before Lakers playoff game is
*  about to tip and just Kobe jerseys everywhere and I went, you know what I
*  wouldn't see in the Charles River minutes before the guard was about to tip off a
*  bunch of bird jerseys and guys outside going like, yeah, I know I like the
*  Celts, but I'm going to miss tonight's playoff game and get some rowing in.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's weird because we've had some distance out of the Kobe thing.
*  I think part of it is just the journey the guy was on.
*  Um, just that the peaks and valleys were so severe and at some point, you
*  know, you see this happen more like in music than in sports really happens in
*  sports where it was like either you were a Kobe fan or you're a Kobe hater and
*  the Kobe fans kind of coalesced around the love of Kobe, right?
*  And then it was us against the world.
*  It was a little like what happened with the Pats was Spygate when, uh, not
*  Spygate, uh, deflate gate when the deflate gate happened and it turned into
*  like new England against everybody.
*  It was fucking awesome.
*  I remember seeing some of your tweets.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you were a lunatic.
*  Oh, everybody lost their minds.
*  I stay in my album.
*  I had a couple of times.
*  I read a couple of them.
*  I remember getting ready to do an ESPN show and be like, he thinks nothing
*  happened, nothing happened.
*  We've no evidence.
*  But that the Kobe thing, when he won those last two titles and got like his
*  like two non-shack titles, this is the, it was the craziest happiest I've ever
*  seen in this city was all anyone talked about the game seven.
*  Yeah.
*  I was in the middle of it.
*  Unfortunately I was there.
*  The, the, the game seven situation is outside of LSU 2003, which nothing
*  will ever top sports wise.
*  Don't care.
*  It's impossible to top it for me.
*  Nothing will ever top sports wise.
*  LSU 2003 national championship will never top it, never be top.
*  But the way the city went nuts, the, the, the, the magic title was one thing.
*  You know, that's getting over the hump again, but to beat the Celtics game
*  seven in staples, like the
*  And to survive an almost catastrophic Kobe game for three quarters.
*  That was the other piece of it where it was almost, almost seemed like he was
*  going to have this legacy killer.
*  Every time, every time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We do this.
*  It's true.
*  Every single time.
*  Like Bill won't like every single time, every single time I bring up
*  That's one of the memories of the game.
*  That amazing, sublime game.
*  Bill must shit on a six or 24 situation.
*  You, you do it every time.
*  I'm not shitting on the fourth quarter because he was one of the
*  reasons in the fourth quarter he started going in the basket.
*  He was rebounding and he, he just, you know, the will, but the first three
*  quarters was the reason they were in that mess in the first place.
*  He was bad.
*  He's trying to be the hero of the game.
*  Everyone was screaming on the streets.
*  The whole city was together.
*  And like, those are the type of moments that you deliver those.
*  And yeah, that's it.
*  The Lakers.
*  And that's the thing.
*  Unless you're Kurt Schoen.
*  Then, then, then, then, then you're set.
*  I remember the first year I moved here in the playoffs, it was that, so it
*  was the 2003 playoffs for my first playoffs and like around April driving
*  around and there, those Laker flags all of a sudden like, what the fuck?
*  What?
*  Where are these?
*  Why does everybody?
*  And it just like, all of a sudden it became like Boston cause the LA is such
*  like a disconnected town, there's all these different teams, but then in the
*  playoffs, you could really feel it.
*  And, uh, and then Kobe brought that back.
*  And I don't know.
*  I, there's just something different about LeBron.
*  I don't think it's his fault.
*  It's just the way it is.
*  It's the DNA thing you mentioned.
*  There's no way if it were reversed, if LeBron were drafted out of high school,
*  won three championships with another guy, then got his two solo ones.
*  And then he was no longer having, right.
*  Yeah.
*  And if cope, like no one would be making the ad argument, but there's.
*  Well, I think we've covered this.
*  Yeah, we have.
*  I can't imagine any other angle that we haven't touched on yet.
*  So.
