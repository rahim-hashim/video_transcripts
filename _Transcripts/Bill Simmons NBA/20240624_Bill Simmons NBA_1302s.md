# Paul George … To the Warriors? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyzazaKuns8)
*  The last time we potted, we were wondering if this Celtics,
*  we're gonna show up for game five of the finals.
*  It seems like a million years ago,
*  there's been a game five title win, a parade,
*  some really fun Celtics moments.
*  We're not gonna talk about this Celtics.
*  We're gonna look forward.
*  We're gonna talk about the draft,
*  some trade rumors we heard.
*  We have a bunch of fun topics.
*  We're gonna do a little Oilers Panthers game seven
*  near the end.
*  You finally caught up on the Karen Reed trial,
*  so I'm excited for this one.
*  We're gonna start with a zag.
*  Paul George.
*  Some smoke now, as we do this on a Sunday,
*  that maybe he's not gonna be on the Clippers next year.
*  And as always with this stuff,
*  I cannot tell what's real and not real.
*  I just know that there's a bunch of teams now
*  that feel like they might have a chance,
*  whether to sign him outright,
*  or to maybe trade for him or whatever,
*  and people are looking at the Clippers.
*  What are they thinking?
*  They've never made the finals with Paul George.
*  Are they gonna pay Kawhi and Harden
*  and Paul George all this money?
*  Paul George heading into year 15?
*  All this stuff we talked about in the past.
*  What's your shit detector level for this story?
*  Because it could always just be the posturing,
*  and it ends up he just signs with the Clippers.
*  He also has his own podcast.
*  He has CAA behind him.
*  They love to create some drama as we head into events.
*  So I'm cautious, but I do feel like
*  he's the biggest domino right now.
*  So what are you thinking about it?
*  Yeah, a lot to get to with this one.
*  I thought it was interesting that on his podcast,
*  he talked about how Harden told him
*  Darrell Moore is a liar in players talk.
*  And I was like, you realize you're hurting
*  your own leverage option here by saying like.
*  With the team that has the most leverage for you to use.
*  I know we're getting into this,
*  but there's been a lot of slip ups lately
*  with all of this access that we have to players.
*  I thought there was one that I sent you
*  where Rich Paul was doing this really front-facing
*  media thing about Bronnie James.
*  And like, well, maybe Minnesota who likes him,
*  but we don't know what the ownership's gonna be.
*  I'm like, I don't know if that's like the number one thing
*  for Bronnie at this stage.
*  It'd be like, is your ownership secure?
*  He talked about Toronto and Masai being an uncle
*  and all that stuff.
*  But I thought it was really interesting when he said,
*  hey, if this was about him playing with LeBron,
*  then we just forced the Lakers to take him at 17.
*  And I went, hmm, that's a slightly different tune
*  than when you tell us all the time LeBron has nothing
*  to do with front office stuff,
*  has nothing to do with the coach.
*  And it was a very straightforward,
*  we'd tell the Lakers to do this.
*  And I went, well, wait, that's the exact opposite tone
*  of everything you said.
*  So anyway, back to the Paul George thing.
*  I love all the access
*  because we get some different thoughts on it.
*  I think it's pretty clear, Bill, and you'd probably agree
*  that he's not been happy about this negotiation
*  for a long time.
*  Like I'm sure he and CAA felt like, okay,
*  I've got some different ideas,
*  but I think it's important to talk about
*  what you think is the right thing to do.
*  Because if you put it like the four year max,
*  like this is who I am, this is what I'm going to do.
*  I know Kawhi took a little bit less,
*  but I'm just supposed to get that.
*  It's polymer.
*  I'm just supposed to get that.
*  And clearly that's not what the Clippers want to do with him.
*  So this has been a long standing thing
*  because it could already been done.
*  And clearly the Clippers don't want to just hand
*  on the blank check that you're supposed to get
*  How much of it is, well, Kawhi Hardin, Paul George, second apron.
*  It's starting to get a little scary.
*  Let's see how this plays out for three years instead of four, or the
*  Quippers are looking at it going, you know, we kind of didn't win anything
*  with this nucleus, maybe we have a chance to turn the asset, the team that.
*  Has been floating around and I don't know how real it is, but I think there's
*  an equal sense of desperation on their side as Golden State because Golden State.
*  And this is it's been reported.
*  People know about it, but I actually feel like it's, it should be the top story.
*  Anytime we're talking trades, it should be the first thing mentioned.
*  Golden state with this situation with Chris Paul's contract.
*  So on June 28th, they either have to guarantee Chris Paul's contract for
*  next season, which is $30 million, or they have to buy it out for $5 million.
*  So it's still a trade asset.
*  The problem is you can't trade them this week.
*  And then the new team can say, oh, cool.
*  We'll just wave Chris Paul's contract and we'll wipe that 30 million off the books.
*  The contract has to be guaranteed by the new team, but the Clippers who are a
*  second apron team and it gets really hard to make trades with second apron teams.
*  The warriors would also be a second apron team if they kept clay Thompson, but if
*  they get rid of clay Thompson, all of a sudden they're not, which means that
*  there's two possible clipper trades that they could do for Paul George.
*  One is they could combine Chris Paul, that contract Clippers would have to
*  guarantee it next year with cominga with Gary Payton for Paul George.
*  The other one is you take Chris Paul with Draymond green, you trade them the
*  Clippers and they send back Paul George and PJ Tucker, and I think they could do that.
*  If they can't, then we only have the first option, but that is how the
*  warriors can get Paul George.
*  They would have to basically guarantee Chris Paul's contract next year.
*  And then they would have to make it work with like cominga and Payton and make it
*  so that it is almost exactly where Paul George's salary is and then it works.
*  Tell me if you agree with me.
*  If you're going state, like you have this once in a generation ticket with
*  Curry, are you really going to waste that?
*  Like, are you just going to say, ah, we had a good run.
*  We won in 22.
*  Now let's have the mid 2010s Kobe retirement tour for the rest of the decade.
*  Basically.
*  I don't think they want that.
*  I don't think he wants that.
*  So I'm watching them the most with, with trade week here.
*  How about you?
*  Yeah.
*  Look, you can not want a lot of things.
*  It doesn't mean you get those things.
*  And I'd agree with you that they probably owe it to Steph more than any
*  franchise owes a single player in the NBA of like, what you're still really good.
*  And there's a two year window.
*  That's its own topic of like, how's that going to look?
*  They just going to extend them and then go, we never want, you know, another
*  uniform, even though we know long-term, we might not even have enough around you.
*  And then maybe that leads all different stuff that we're speculating on.
*  Again, we've got time for that one, but it's funny because in the past, like Paul
*  George was offered for clay Thompson when he was still with the Pacers.
*  Richard was offering Paul George everywhere.
*  And even if you, at that time, I think the consensus would have been, okay, wait,
*  Paul George is better than clay Thompson.
*  Um, but what you're doing is you're trading your non-problem for the Paul George problem.
*  Well, fast forward a bunch of years.
*  And if you look at the warrior situation, like there's all these players, we could
*  talk about Jimmy Butler, we can talk about Paul George, there's some lesser people
*  like Levine or Kuzma or whatever.
*  It's like, well, how do we, if you're the warriors, how do we raise just our level
*  of talent doesn't guarantee us anything.
*  Paul George may not even fit our movement and all the stuff that we're doing, but
*  based on the options and what we'd have to actually invest in the player on top of
*  everything else, whether it's a Butler extension or a Paul George extension.
*  At this point, I think you're so desperate with where you are in the limitations you
*  have financially, the lack of assets around the people that you don't want to even
*  move where it probably starts to make a little bit more sense because now you're
*  not looking at yourself as some perfect engine where you don't want to non Golden
*  State warrior type basketball player disrupt what you're doing.
*  You're looking for anybody to be just way better than what your second or third
*  options have been.
*  And that leads to the clay decision that they're going to have to make.
*  Like when you mentioned Chris Paul and Draymond, I don't think you have to give
*  up that much because George is going to be able to say, look, much like the Chris
*  Paul scenario in 2017 with the Clippers going to the Rockets, you can either trade
*  me to this team, which I'll opt in and then get an extension later, or you're going
*  to lose me for nothing.
*  Well, we saw Philly had that with Hardin, right?
*  Hardin could opt it out for free.
*  Hc.
*  We didn't have the same kind of teams with cap space that we do this year, but he
*  opts in and then it's like, yeah, trade me.
*  And what does Philly end up with?
*  They end up with the tomb and Coventon and they get a couple of picks.
*  Now is it, I think they got less than maybe they were hoping.
*  I think the Paul George thing is a little different because there's more suitors
*  for him, right?
*  Like it's not just Golden State.
*  I think the Lakers, like what if, is there a possible LeBron, Paul George swap
*  a room?
*  Is that conceivable?
*  I don't know.
*  Like if you're Balmer, could you get super excited about that?
*  Cause you got the arena open up.
*  You didn't, and you just flip those guys.
*  Maybe you even give more assets for that.
*  If you're the Rockets, do you think the Lakers would want LeBron in a Clippers
*  uniform, even if it meant Paul George?
*  I don't know what they meant.
*  This is the same franchise that put out like a two sentence farewell to Jerry
*  West, who was one of the greatest Lakers of all time.
*  They're like Jerry was a very valuable person.
*  Thank you.
*  We're going to miss him.
*  Uh, Houston, I just think they're in play for anybody at anything because of all
*  the ads they're the most three for one type of team we've seen in a while.
*  And then Orlando and Philly just have the cap space to sign them.
*  And that's the scary part.
*  If you're the Clippers, cause unlike the hardened year with Philly, it was, it
*  was one of those, well, where are you going to go?
*  James, right?
*  Where are you getting that money?
*  Cause Dallas is resigning Kyrie.
*  Like we're going down, down the line.
*  Who, who has the cap space you're looking for Houston pivoted away from you.
*  Got Van Vliet and Brooks.
*  You don't have the team.
*  There are two teams in this case.
*  And then three, if he just wanted to get a lot of money from Detroit, which I
*  don't even know if Detroit would want to do that, but, um, the Golden State
*  scenario, I think is the most interesting to me.
*  Would you agree though that they probably don't have to do like,
*  like if you're getting Kaminga back in this, then maybe get off Dramon.
*  I mean, we were going to do a, what would you do later with Golden State?
*  We could just do it now.
*  Cause it's not that long.
*  There's three paths.
*  They could just get rid of Chris Paul, just not resign them.
*  They could let clay sign with somebody else.
*  They could package Chris Paul with Dramon and try to trade him for Paul George or
*  somebody like that, and just try to get rid of all three contracts and basically
*  just move into the next phase and just say, you know what we built our building.
*  We've won four titles.
*  We won in 22.
*  We're going to go with Steph and the young guys and we're bidding goodbye to
*  that era, or you go the other way and you say, we're going to use this Chris Paul
*  contract, we're going to keep paying this crazy luxury tax, second April thing
*  that, um, you know, that last year, I think they set the record for the, the
*  highest tax number anybody had paid.
*  And we're just going to keep doing that.
*  Cause we're the warriors and cause we have Steph.
*  And if that's the case, then then use the Chris Paul thing.
*  Cause otherwise you're paying him 30 million basically to be your ninth
*  man and to be a trade asset in February.
*  I don't see how they would do that.
*  Well, there's no way they're going to do that because they're at 174 with Chris
*  Paul and Looney where that option for eight plus million is tomorrow.
*  And then, uh, that's what Santos under contract.
*  So they're not even covering clay yet.
*  No, that's without clay.
*  So the cap next year is 141.
*  The tax is 171.3.
*  The first apron is 178.
*  So as soon as you do a deal with clay and the reported deal that he wasn't
*  interested in, what was two years and 48 million.
*  So I don't know if that's last year with Draymond where they're like, he's
*  going to leave son of money.
*  It's not not happening.
*  And then all of a sudden he was resigning for four years.
*  I don't trust any of the reports to you.
*  Not when the numbers like I.
*  I just feel like we're hit over the head with numbers.
*  I mean, it happens in media too, with guys that do our jobs where this
*  number just gets floated and everybody freaks out.
*  It's the Boris thing.
*  Just floated absurd number because like, remember with Draymond, you're going
*  wait, are you really going to go like four years, 160 for him?
*  And then it turns out to be like, Oh, three for a hundred, but you probably felt
*  better about Draymond a year ago than you feel about clay present day.
*  Correct.
*  Yes.
*  Listen, there's a scenario where they just let clay clay leave and they let
*  Chris Paul leave and they're just like, you know what we looked at the west.
*  We looked at the East.
*  Like we, we have no chance to compete against a team like Boston or wherever.
*  Um, okay.
*  C is going, um, Minnesota Dallas.
*  We just, we can't swim in that pool anymore.
*  And we're trying to be realistic about it.
*  We're not going to chase it.
*  We didn't even make the playoffs last year.
*  What's got, what's really going to be different for us?
*  What's, what could be different as if they made like a huge swing at Paul
*  George or, you know, you mentioned a couple of those names, right?
*  It's like Paul George and Jimmy Butler is tier a tier B is talking
*  yourself into Brandon Ingram, who I think has more value than Zach Levin.
*  But Steve Kerr coach Brandon Ingram on TV USA.
*  And by the end of the thing, Brandon Ingram is like, yeah, he's not going
*  to play in the last two games.
*  Um, and Zach Levin, where you could almost argue that's a negative asset.
*  And then the third tier would be, let's just rebuild them and just curry.
*  We'll sell out the arena and that's what we're going to do.
*  And we have no chance to win the title.
*  I, my guess is they're too competitive to do that, but that might be the smart move.
*  I don't know how different you'll be though.
*  Starting the rebuild now with Steph, the attraction, as opposed to worrying
*  about the Steph decision in two years.
*  Right.
*  See what I'm saying?
*  Like you're right.
*  Everything you said is right.
*  But if you're on the golden state side of it, you could probably talk
*  to yourself in a few things.
*  You say, Hey, last 50 games, there were 31 and 19 was the eighth
*  best record in the NBA from that stretch.
*  They were six on offense, 16th in defense.
*  Clay after the all-star break was a better player.
*  He was his splits.
*  His shooting splits were 45 41.
*  If you want to look at his total two years, he's kind of a net negative
*  and defensively he's just not the same.
*  But there was some good clay closing months from the season in a stretch
*  where he got benched and people were wondering like what he was even going
*  to be in the free agent market.
*  So you also, which is a big assumption, you go, it has to be a better
*  dream on year, right?
*  Does it?
*  It has to be.
*  Does it?
*  Do you think it's going to get worse?
*  I will be the same amount of drama that we had last year.
*  I don't know.
*  I wouldn't bet on it either way.
*  I, I can't say that I've seen a lot of signs that it's going to be less dramatic.
*  It just was so dramatic.
*  I just have a hard time believing like we're going to get the exact same thing.
*  I mean, the guy basically conned all of us into thinking that it was like,
*  I just going to step away from the game.
*  Like it was an unbelievable spin on all of this stuff.
*  It's like, Hey, just stop fucking punching people.
*  And it was like, I just have to figure out where I'm at right now.
*  Self aware in any conceivable way.
*  Well, and speaking of self aware, like one of the things they have to do with clay
*  leak monk, who I think if you're going to compare clay at an advancing age to
*  different scores in the league or a little up and down, or maybe they can't
*  guard anybody that well and they're more consistent offensively or whatever.
*  Malik Monk was 78 million for four years.
*  Is clay Thompson worth more than Malik Monk?
*  I would say no.
*  I would say that's right around his range, whether it's two years, three years or
*  four, it's probably between like 17 to 20 million a year for what he is at
*  this point of his career.
*  The question is, does he think that?
*  And I'm going to, I'm going to guess no.
*  By the way, have you been watching the English patient?
*  No.
*  Why?
*  Or the King's speech?
*  Why?
*  Just your work with Malik Monk.
*  You said his name right twice.
*  We're all trying to get better.
*  You know, it doesn't matter how old you are.
*  We're all trying to improve.
*  I can't say Wimbledon.
*  I still, I still call Wimbledon.
*  Get ready for that with the T instead of the D.
*  Robert Ori is probably, yeah.
*  Robert Ori is probably out there being like, why does he think I sleep around so much?
*  Robert, Robert, I have some bad ones.
*  I'll fully admit it.
*  All right.
*  So your Paul George prediction is what?
*  Hold on.
*  I want, I just want to stay like on the Golden State.
*  You're right about all of the rest of the West.
*  Like if they're being honest, I've done Levi and Kerr and Lakeup and they're all
*  talking to each other and going, Hey, like we're probably, we're not going to
*  be better than any of those teams.
*  But if you wanted to have a positive day, you would say all the things I said.
*  You go, okay, Pajemski will be better.
*  Jackson Davis was a hit.
*  Kaminga finally showed us some stretches of like being a real thing here.
*  So you may not even be in a hurry to be trading him for anybody else.
*  Less dramatic Draymond year.
*  Less dramatic Draymond year.
*  And I know what will happen if Chris Paul's waved and they don't get anybody.
*  You're just going to say like, I can't believe they wasted that asset.
*  And I'm just going to go, well, maybe, maybe Paul George can just force their
*  hand and that leads to a Wiggins deal and a couple picks and maybe it isn't even
*  Kaminga, maybe it's Looney because Jackson Davis feels like a better option there.
*  And that's how you start adding up some of the money for it.
*  Because when you look at the Chris Paul Houston thing, there's actually a couple
*  of decent pieces in there.
*  It's just a lot of stuff.
*  It was Pat Bev.
*  It was.
*  Couple, couple picks, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Montrez, Lou Will, Sam Decker, shout out, um, Kyle Wilcher for those that want to
*  keep track, John Dre Ligand, Liggins.
*  And there was a first that was Spelman.
*  So they actually like got a couple of things there, but that just depends on if
*  Paul George is going to say, Hey, look, you have to trade me here.
*  And it's not a perfect fit.
*  It doesn't make the warriors the favorites, although on TV for 24 hours,
*  somebody will probably say it.
*  And maybe that's the best case scenario of just going, we're raising our talent
*  level, even though Paul George at 34 years old, right?
*  Year 15 played the most games he's played in five years, the previous four years.
*  He never got north as 60 games in a season.
*  And for Paul George to thrive, he needs to be somebody that doesn't have all
*  the pressure on him and Steph would take some of that pressure away from.
*  I still think Philadelphia makes the most sense for him because there'll be
*  the maxi night, you know, and beads good for his 30, 15 or whatever.
*  Um, and Paul George can kind of just be a higher price Tobias Harris at times,
*  but knowing that he'll also have some games where he looks like one of the
*  10 best players in the league.
*  Cause I do think he's, I do feel more comfortable about him having some of
*  those high level playoff games.
*  I just don't expect to pencil them in for like six or seven in a row in a long
*  series, higher price Tobias Harris.
*  I'm trying to decide how insulting that was because Tobias was making
*  40 million last year.
*  I guess I just mean moving forward, how much he's going to make.
*  No, no, I'm not.
*  I'm, but you were right to like, the phrase is correct.
*  I'm like, Ooh, higher price Tobias Harris, who's probably the least like sixer
*  of the last, uh, since bed Simmons.
*  We just saw it though, right against Dow.
*  I mean, am I unfair in saying there were moments in there where you're looking
*  at Paul George going, Hey, call him the coin flip brother now.
*  I mean, it's year 15.
*  You're not going to change that much in year 15 as a basketball player.
*  But my guess he could never go anywhere right now.
*  Like that's why Orlando actually probably makes a little less sense.
*  Unless Powell just takes it up to another level, which I think is totally within
*  reason. I think Franz will just by default be a better shooter this year.
*  But if Paul George goes to a place where he has to be the one option all the time,
*  maxi and B take a ton of pressure off of him.
*  Steph would maybe if clay has some kind of bounce back that carries over, like
*  could he possibly be a little bit better than he was even after the All-Star break?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't, I don't think it's impossible or any of those things.
*  I think he'd like to fit for him on the Lakers the most.
*  If you just flipped him in LeBron, I like that fit for him.
*  Him playing with Davis and Rui and Austin Reeves, JJ coaching.
*  And I don't know.
*  I just think that would be, I think the most fun basketball trade would just be
*  flipping LeBron and Paul George and putting LeBron on the Clippers with
*  Kawhi and James Harden.
*  I would just enjoy that more as a basketball fan.
*  One last thing on Golden State.
*  The case for them doing something with that Chris Paul contract is that we just
*  got ringer top hundred last few days ago.
*  I'd curry seventh and it goes back to something I'm never going to waiver on.
*  If you have a top 10 guy in the league, somebody who has a chance to be a
*  first team, OMBA guy, somebody who has a chance, if you have the right team to
*  be an MVP candidate, you kind of have to go for it.
*  You know, this was the case for OKC with SGA last year when it was like, Hey
*  guys, you might be a one seed.
*  You have a guy who's one of the best four guys in the league.
*  Like he take, can you take this a little more seriously?
*  So if you're the Warriors, Steph is still at that level and maybe he's not going
*  to be at that level for more than a year or two years.
*  I don't know.
*  But if they can turn that Chris Paul thing into a better asset, you might have
*  to do it, especially with the way the lead, the values of the franchises are going
*  up and that's probably a $7 billion team at this point.
*  By the way, in the LeBron front, as soon as he opts out though, that's just not
*  an option.
*  Yeah.
*  Good point.
*  But couldn't they sign and trade him after he opts out though?
*  I thought they could.
*  I'm always confused by those rules.
*  I think they can.
*  Once it can be like the double, the double, uh, whatever.
