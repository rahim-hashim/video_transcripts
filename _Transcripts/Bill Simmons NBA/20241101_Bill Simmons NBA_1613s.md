# NBA OverUnders Update With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWJ1tZnG4Rg)
*  All right, house. We wanted to just quickly dive into over unders with the NBA again. It's been we're in day 10
*  We don't know what's gonna happen tonight, but there's already been some movement. There's been some regrets. There's been some self congratulations
*  One of the things that's really moved
*  Memphis the over under for them is dropped from I think was 47 and a half when we did the podcast with versillo a month ago
*  It's now 44 and a half. Oh, wow
*  And it's not looking great for them and we were wondering in that West carousel who was gonna be good
*  Who's not gonna be good was somebody gonna get nudged out that we weren't expecting
*  Memphis has had some injuries already verna was making just a ton of excuses
*  He's bringing up things that happened two years ago three or four or no poor bro
*  45 wins seems ambitious for this team, but that that one jumped out of me. What'd you think?
*  I
*  Still we all took the under I think didn't we all take the other?
*  Yeah, we know nobody locked it though because there's just too much variance we haven't really seen jaw get going
*  He hasn't been up to his level yet. We've seen it in you know fits and starts
*  But if when is the team gonna be healthy, but that's the thing we keep saying
*  Well, you know, let's see this team when they have all their guys
*  When is that gonna be when is you know triple J's back? Is he fizzy? Is he good? Like how good is he gonna be?
*  Canard still you know dinged like when are we going to see that that that team and with all of its strength where they're able
*  To get on a stretch and and run it on out
*  I mean also I play the under do they seem as special as they did three years ago just because the league's so much more
*  Talented like their nucleus which seemed really cool three years ago now
*  It's I look around the league pass and it feels like 15 teams
*  Have a cool nucleus and now I just don't see them from a talent standpoint swimming in the pool of some of these
*  Other teams so that that was one
*  We both had Atlanta
*  Over 36 and a half that's dropped to 35 and a half. You just watched them twice against all your wizards. What were your thoughts? I
*  Don't know what's going on if the idea is they're
*  Experimenting with lineups if there are injuries that I'm unaware of on Atlanta like I need I haven't gone deep into the
*  Hawks hive to see you read it. Yeah, I don't know what's going on
*  But David Roddy played 32 minutes last night and had the green light
*  He had the green light from from coach coach Snyder
*  They can't defend
*  Anyone Jonas Valen Judas
*  What a guy he already I'm ready to crown him. Yeah, trade him now
*  Like you trade him
*  He's an amazing
*  Stabilizing force he was openly coaching on the floor the young guy
*  So Washington played all three of the guys that they drafted in the first round this most recent draft
*  I mean SAR actually looked pretty good SAR had a couple moves. He knocked down a couple threes
*  But pretty good like he was able to run in a straight line back and forth or
*  No, he made he looked you know decent but this is the Hawks defense
*  Washington scored a hundred and thirty three points last night
*  Without really breaking a sweat. I don't know what the they had no answer for Valen Judas and
*  The Wizards, you know cut them to death. I I'm worried about the Hawks. I'm worried
*  I'm a little worried too because you shouldn't be losing to the Wizards not back to back games. Yeah, that's pretty rough
*  We like Brooklyn it was 18 and a half when we did it
*  It's now up to 20 and a half sure and it makes sense from what I'm watching they're super competitive in these games
*  Camp Thomas so we made fun of a week ago the guys scoring the guys scoring
*  You know defenses are like now gearing to stop him and he's still getting points. So Schroeder
*  I
*  Don't know what they're gonna do because they're the team's almost a little too confident whether they're gonna try to figure out how to
*  Sabotage that but they've jumped out at me as like they were in the running for a worst team in the league
*  I don't think they are
*  Right play they play hard and then you know
*  It could have beaten Denver by the way, too. Hey, they're record. They could have a winning record right now
*  Absolutely. No, they're they're they're they're alive that they keep playing this hard and and their guys are committed. They're on the same page
*  They're playing hard for Geordie
*  I think that you know Geordie at some point management might step in and say look look look look we need to take it and we'll
*  Start sharing some rotations out of that already. Here's some Alibaba stock. Can you just play Ben Simmons and crunch time?
*  And hope the other team fouls him
*  But but right now they're they're they're live. I like weird team like they bring Claxton off the bench
*  That the cam Thomas stuff some of the possessions with him he looks like a 30-point score and
*  You know, we made fun of him on the over-under pot about how he's a good good stats bad team guy
*  But he was making cry. I might have to usher an apology soon
*  Let's just let it play out a little bit
*  We're still in the weird season right now
*  The Bulls are up to 30 and a half which matches the eye test
*  Yeah, it was I think 28 and a half when we did it
*  but you know that it's a team that has a lot of professional basketball players on offense and
*  They're kind of a pain in the ass to play. I I've actually been pretty impressed by them
*  That's another team that's playing hard. They're not playing to tank and they're I don't know if they're playing hard
*  To tank and they're I don't even know that they're necessarily
*  Auditioning assets for the purposes of trading them
*  I think they're gonna try and play and I think they're gonna try and make the play in that's how they
*  That what we see so far and they do have talent
*  I mean part of the case that we discussed with Rossello at the over-under pod was like what's the rebound for giddy?
*  What what's good giddy look like he's got the keys to the car. He looks good to me
*  Yeah, they you know conversely like when like when you're watching Atlanta
*  And I still like that I'm not ready to give up on the Hawks yet
*  But they look like kind of a mess the both their interior not look like a mess
*  Yeah, right the interior defense for Atlanta is an abomination literally if they should trade for your this valentunis that they might win
*  You know 45 they there. I don't know if you know their defense
*  They just don't have a body
*  The calves
*  One of our great ones. Yeah, what do we have them before the year? That was like 48 and a half
*  It was the high 40s. Yeah, it was like 48 and a half
*  That is up to 52 and a half on fan duel and then if you go to the division
*  Which I am proud to say I am a calves division ticket holder because I was in Boston
*  Bet it making fan duel bets like a month ago. The calves are now minus 140 for the central the bucks are plus 270
*  The Pacers are plus
*  340 and I gotta be honest. I don't think those calves odds are I
*  Actually think those are pretty good odds. I think they should be like two to one favorites, right?
*  Sure. Sure the way that way that looks was the thing. This was the idea
*  Coming in and why we were so bullish on them. We were like, you know, let's see Kenny Atkinson with this team
*  Remember how Kenny Atkinson right had wings how he nurtured wings
*  Kenny Atkinson with like a healthy Garland and a Mitchell who knows he's gonna be there and a team that's been together for three years
*  It looks great Mowgli and Jared and him empowering Mowgli, especially like you and we you can't
*  Overstate how impactful his assertiveness has been thus far
*  What do you think a division parlay of OKC Cleveland and the Celtics is all three of those to win their revisions
*  What would your guess be for that is it okay see Cleveland Boston?
*  Can you get it to even odds a tiny bit better than even odds? What if I told you it was plus 268?
*  Oh, wow. What am I misunderstanding about this?
*  The Celtics odds they're still only minus 210 for the Atlantic because people still believe in the Knicks
*  And then okay see because of Minnesota's in there. They're only minus 220
*  Oh, I seem crazy to me. I agree with what would have to happen for okay
*  I see not to have the best record in that division
*  I had both of those teams winning their divisions in the minus 400 by like we've seen it
*  Yeah, like we've only seen five games, but that's enough for me. I totally I was really surprised by that
*  All right a couple more over unders because this is really fun
*  And we haven't even gotten to the super fun one yet, and I can't I can't wait to discuss it
*  Denver
*  Still holding tight at 49 and a half Oh
*  We when we did the pod
*  That seems they're gonna win 50 games. I don't see that at all
*  You're allowed to curse on the Bill Simmons podcast fuck. No, they're not with a 50 games
*  What do you have to happen? What's the have to be to have like a complete career resurgence?
*  There is they they have one of the worst benches in the NBA. Yeah walked in like this is disrespectful
*  honestly, it's disrespectful to Joker for this tension between
*  You know in the in the in the in the coach
*  Yes
*  the and then and the personnel decisions that have been made you can't use up the Joker three-time MVP and
*  We're gonna just waste away their opportunity to really compete because they gave Michael Porter jr. A giant goddamn
*  Contract and this is the thing that kills teams in the NBA you cannot pay
*  Shitty role good players like super effing stars, and that's what they did and now they're gonna pay the price for it
*  It almost sounds like you have personal experience as a fan with the team doing that
*  15 years worth
*  The most recent 15 years though of you know arenas
*  Who immediately
*  I mean that's my favorite
*  You guys this you guys amnesty andre blatch for his extension kicked in was my favorite NBA moment of the century
*  I was only a three-year contract that was
*  What was better than that ever in the history of front offices? I mean Jan Mahin me got a four-year 50 million dollar deal
*  Go back and look there. It's it's amazing Washington's the best. What was the trade when you traded the step curry pick?
*  It was for Randy Foy and Mike Miller. Yeah, that's what that's what it was
*  That was the trade because this could end up being you could have a choice of Ricky Rubio pre a CL and your step curry
*  True, that's true. Those were the choices. Yes, correct. That's right. Unbelievable
*  See people don't know the NBA history
*  They think the NBA started when Kobe won his last title in the Lakers in 2010 and LeBron went to Miami
*  That was the start of the NBA other shit happened including that
*  Clippers over under one of my locks was Clippers under thirty seven and a half now
*  They did lose to Portland last night. Yes, but they're over his jump to thirty eight and a half and
*  Nice I still feel okay with my position. I gotta be honest. Yeah, I look they they play hard and they play defense
*  That's the thing that that has impressed me the most with the Clippers. They're a thing
*  Well, I mean, you know there you're gonna get have bad spots
*  schedule wise throughout the NBA season and who knows what kind of
*  Mischief folks might have got into and there are always sub stories about losses, but I was so impressed by
*  The way that the Clippers played they had
*  State yeah, that was that was for some reason the Clippers have always played Golden State. Well, there's certain teams
*  Indian always always looks really good against Boston are really horrible
*  Like there's certain matchups that just seem to for whatever reason the Clippers do well against them
*  Lakers are up to forty four and a half
*  Which looked a lot more enticing until they lost by thirty against Cleveland. It's like yeah
*  This is what happens when you play young athletic teams. I
*  Still feel like they're gonna be around that number
*  I'm glad I don't have that as a lock either way and I guess it would depend on the ad help
*  Here's one though, Miami
*  When we did it, I think it was forty four and a half now. It's forty three and a half
*  They feel very trade-ish to me
*  I am on Jimmy Butler trade watch now like I'm just ready
*  Didn't they basically announce didn't pet Riley basically say what he publicly called out Butler
*  as the summer arrived that
*  He's essentially available
*  Golden State or Houston if you had to pick a team for him. Oh, wow just for being a basketball team
*  Basketball fan with no dog in the race
*  Well, who can Golden State give Miami that helps Miami situation in any way shape or form?
*  it's probably like a
*  It's like comingo Wiggins
*  One more contract and a couple picks. I mean those like oh we want Golden State's, you know
*  Afterthoughts, I don't know Houston is much more viable to me because they have like a bunch of young talent
*  And dying to do a three for one two. Yeah, I hit that last week. Okay, the Milwaukee Bucks. Oh
*  poor doc
*  Their overhunder is down to forty six and a half. It's still too high
*  I think when we did it was it was fifty and a half or fifty one and a half
*  It was the right around that fifty one fifty. It might have been high forty nines even
*  It was close
*  It was up for it. Where do you stand on the forty six and a half? I would still take the under I'm not hesitating
*  There's no
*  Reservations about it whatsoever. You know every other day and it turns out it's once a week day and
*  I know they met last week everybody or last year. Everyone made fun of me
*  He's good once a week and then he plays two other games
*  It's it's too much and honestly
*  You know, I kept giving you a hard time when we were doing the over under pod about talking about the idea of Yanis
*  Maybe you know looking to take it down somewhere else
*  That's what you did. You made me feel like a prick. I
*  They have continued to invest in him. They've given him every extension. He's been eligible for
*  Yeah, but that's not a that's not a competitive team. They have no answers
*  Their answers are to trade all of those guys. They need to start trading guys now
*  They can't wait like who wants our guys if there's any Brooke Lopez
*  Well, I mean Brooklyn like Brooke Lopez as a you know veteran like a three-point stabilizing like to New Orleans
*  Yeah, right, right, right, right do it now. Don't wait that you have no chance
*  That team is dead. That is a dead on arrival team
*  Well, it was fifty and a half when we did the pot so it's dropped four wins, which is a lot
*  yeah, that tells you all you need to know the
*  Oklahoma cities around the same Orlando is still the same at forty seven and a half, which I was really surprised by
*  Why?
*  Because they look like a 50-win team to me I thought that would have bumped up like a win
*  They like in on them with blocks for over forty seven and a half. So feeling good. Okay. This is another classic
*  so before the year
*  the Philadelphia 76ers
*  Over under fifty and a half
*  What do you think it is now?
*  47 and a half forty six and a half
*  God damn it. So the Bucks and the Sixers have both dropped four wins in ten days
*  It's the start of the season. And by the way, I think I'd like the under I
*  understand I
*  Went back to look at the sheet and I couldn't believe that I took their over. I don't know what I was
*  You were scared of the Embiid thing and I was telling you that there was stuff there were rumors about his knee in September
*  Well, I part of it for me. I'm sure
*  Was the fact that I thought that Paul George and maxi were gonna be enough
*  I thought Paul George would be playing basketball by now. He's not
*  I don't know where his name when we did the podcast to be yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a three-week injury
*  And that had just happened. It happened. Yeah in the 24 hours before we sat down
*  You fucked up. It was a fuck-up. I did it is a fuck-up. I'm just saying, you know, I imagine
*  What else is a fuck-up pretending that Embiid was on a rest program when he's fucking hurt
*  Also a mistake. It's so weird. Why did they do that? Why say anything?
*  What they didn't want to be embarrassed because they gave him an extension fucking hurt
*  What was their choice?
*  How about this that they let him play in the Olympics and it's like well, that's not their job. It's a player
*  It's free will the players get to do and being in Kawago in the Olympics is one of the biggest jokes of this decade
*  That either those guys thought that was a good idea and that their teams
*  Had to pretend publicly that it was a good idea to go along with it. Yeah, I know it'll be good
*  I'll be good for you. It's good for your brand and be it should have been in a fucking hyperbaric chamber for six months
*  Literally getting training at altitude like yeah, what were we doing? Well, here's the things were big
*  Yes, it's a it's bad for and bead in the sense of
*  Performing for the team that pays him and performing in the league that is, you know the
*  True way that he's gonna be compensated but for his he played great in some of those games
*  Yeah, he did and and there were some like genuine and bead moments and he has that
*  metal now and I do think that there was
*  You know, we've we've talked about this in the past with these international competitions some of that winning dust might have rubbed off on him
*  Being around those guys and watching how they did it like he hasn't been around very much winning dust in his career
*  And and seeing him why you know, he's on the floor when Steph goes off. Yeah, he's on the floor with LeBron
*  I that that all could ultimately pay off because really it won't matter until April but for the purposes of over under this is a dead
*  Under and I'm gonna lose my money
*  You and I have been following basketball a long time a
*  Long time too long we remember too many things
*  I I don't know what to do with a lot of the information in my brain at this point
*  It's he's had so many injuries that yeah, we've just seen this before. Yeah when
*  It we saw it with Blake Griffin a few years ago
*  It's like you just start counting all the injuries and it's like oh man. This isn't gonna go great
*  There's been too many now and I just wonder if he's at that point and they wouldn't even tell us what the knee injury is
*  Now we don't even know what it is
*  But he's had problems with both knees and he's gigantic
*  Right and at some point you pass the point of no return
*  Which is why it's so nuts that a they gave me extension and B
*  It made a ton of sense why he would have wanted the extension because maybe he knew he wasn't a hundred percent. It's like fine
*  I'll take one more giant, you know couple extra years him wanting the extension makes makes perfect sense
*  I just don't understand enough about the the dynamics for them to say one word about
*  Like what his health situation is or where when he's gonna come out they were embarrassed
*  I really feel like they thought they could kind of slide around this and have nobody notice and they do to do
*  rest management and have
*  People go. Oh, yeah, they're doing risk management and people getting mad at that instead of getting mad at the fact that and beat is fucking injured
*  So stupid it's so I I hold the brain trust for the six years perhaps in too high regard that's that's that's maybe the thing
*  Sacramento is down to 44 and a half. Actually that might be where it was
*  I don't have an opinion on that st. Antonio who we went under on is the same at 35 and a half
*  No, you talk like the under which I went under on and
*  You
*  What did you I went under I definitely went under on yeah
*  We are I think we all made it gone under that poor kid Hendrix what happened to his leg over. Oh, no for you
*  It's all 27 and a half. It's now 24 and a half shit that poor kid Hendrix. I hope he gets back
*  I hope that his leg that was awful. I've never seen that. I've never seen that injury before the way he did it
*  Yeah, yeah, cuz it wasn't contact. He didn't come down on somebody's foot. That's what you expect to see in basketball
*  It was almost like when you're watching injury. Yeah when you're watching Instagram reels and
*  Somebody's going to get their mail and it's icy out and their leg right away
*  I've never seen just a basketball player. It was just so such a fluke. Yeah, I felt bad for that. I'm rude
*  last but not least
*  You're washed in Wizards
*  Over 20 and a half, you know, I'm so pissed
*  Here's the thing
*  This is the team that I thought they might have last season
*  I this is like some professionals mixed with kids the professionals set sort of the the
*  expectation they they lead the kids into you know, the possibility of just just compete just compete
*  Yeah, the number was low last season. They they added
*  in the form of
*  Yeah, balance units I'm telling you he was on the floor coaching Bob Carrington and and and coaching
*  County George and and it was amazing to see his pushing star
*  Where he needs to go that's our and and balance units were on the floor very much at the same time
*  But like you could see him. It was such a beauty. See the unit retire number
*  I'm ready to I look if you when you put him next to the biggie and Bobby Dandridge
*  He bought all in on they said we're gonna pay you come come be this guy for this team and he bought all in
*  On it and I just was now I'll tell you it was very quiet in the stadium and I was sitting, you know
*  Thank thank big. Thanks to our good friends at FanDuel for the seats
*  Close enough to hear some of the the actual dialogue
*  But man, I was so impressed by that guy
*  So you're thinking I went under as a lock at 20 and a half
*  They could win 21 games they're still gonna be one of the three worst teams with if they win 21 games
*  Yeah, it's irresponsible if they don't trade balance units before the trade deadline because they got to play off teams actually need that dude
*  I could think of four teams right now that could you know, you know, it could use them the pelicans. Holy right shit
*  What is going on? They're probably not allowed to trade for him, you know last thing
*  Celtics Pacers last night
*  You know the cells say no poor zingas like you can get to the rim on them, right?
*  So they started playing Kada in the second half to try to change some of that and the Pacers were playing great
*  So this couldn't into three and it just seemed like one of those games and Joe Maz who I don't think I've done a
*  Harder 180 on out of any coach or manager I've ever had like I fucking love Joe Maz
*  You see his thing about Katie bakes and Beck wrote about it today for the rigor that he thinks they should have basketball fighting
*  Oh, yeah
*  I agree with him
*  But Joe Maz was feeling out the game the same way I was watching it where I was like, I know we're down 18
*  but I feel like we can come back and
*  Just kind of stuck with this lineup stuck with Kada and the Celts came came back and all of a sudden they had a little
*  You know, we're the fucking champs
*  Last three minutes huge comeback Tatum hit a big three
*  Send it to OT and then the Pacers just made a couple
*  I mean it came down to like Siakam at a 29 footer at the top of the key
*  Yeah, which I will give him a hundred times out of a hundred sure made it
*  Sometimes you'll get a wide open shot from Jalen who sucked the whole night and he missed it but
*  It was weirdly a great loss. It was like a let's defend our turf kind of loss and the fact that they looked this good without
*  poor zingas
*  I just I like everything I'm seeing from them. It's it's really like this team is good
*  Well, they're really really really good as a defending champ the sub story that I like also though is is the Pacers as a potential
*  thorn in the side for Boston because that
*  That playoff series was closer than what was three is going to show they were competitive and their style of offense does give
*  Boston there are a rare team that can give Boston a little bit of trouble because of how
*  Carlisle schemes up, but you know what's interesting about them and it's been the whole year like they didn't have math or in the playoffs last
*  Right matter and if you watch them knowing nothing like if you woke up from a coma after five years
*  And you just watch the Pacers game you would think math or and was like their alpha sure
*  It's like clear out of her fucking score here, right? The Pacers are good, man. I good. I think you could make a case Orlando
*  Cleveland and the Pacers
*  You know over Milwaukee and Philly I think I would take all three of those as regular season teams
*  I don't think there's any question, but it was a really good game. Yeah, they're all gonna finish ahead of Philly
*  I'm super happy with the Celtics season then you watch okay see same thing like just they have depth
*  They're athletic. They're fucking competitive as hell like Chet just loves going against Wemby. That game was awesome. It was awesome
*  I love I love so far what we've seen out of Oklahoma City in terms of a tiny click of
*  Fraternity I see a patience in them that I don't know that I saw last year
*  It's because Jalen Williams is a little bit better. He might be yeah
*  Wiggins is a little bit better and Wallace second year and then Chet
*  You know he made a little bit of a leap like not not quite the same leap that Palo has been hinting at
*  I saw some on the bench with Hardenstein talking to Chet. They clearly have a nice rapport
*  I wonder if those guys in their you know training camp before Hardenstein got hurt like if there's like a mentor thing going on
*  There because because Hardenstein. He's a big mother f for a big physical guy
*  I wonder if he's imparting some stuff to Chet that's gonna be an absolute bitch of a team to play in the playoffs
*  Like I have nothing we like them as the one seed division champ all record like I've seen nothing that makes me think
*  We were off on that. I saw like when they do the post games and the whole team is in the post game interview
*  It's great. It's a little 2001
*  2001 paths ish, but yeah from everything I've seen the Celtics and the Thunder just seem like they're up here
*  It's a drop night tonight. It could be five six seven other
*  Other teams than that. Yeah
