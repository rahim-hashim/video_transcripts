# The Wolves Sweep! What Now for the Phoenix Suns? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0)
*  What a night for Rossella and I. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=0.0s)]
*  This is great. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=3.34s)]
*  It's just like, if we had a basketball child together, it would be Anthony Edwards. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=4.36s)]
*  And just watching him blossom. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=9.32s)]
*  I just feel like I'm watching our kid go through high school and get a four [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=10.94s)]
*  row senior year and letter jackets and win the state championship. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=16.6s)]
*  This is just really special. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=21.0s)]
*  This is the first time I really felt like this guy might be the guy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=23.46s)]
*  Like a year or two years from now in the league, like in, in a real way, like [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  final level face of the league, best guy in the league, he's just hitting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=33.56s)]
*  every checkpoint, Rossella. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=39.08s)]
*  He isn't. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  It feels like it's ahead of schedule and like a concerned parent, because I get it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=41.88s)]
*  I still get it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=47.08s)]
*  I was afraid for him in a way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=49.24s)]
*  Like I was afraid. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=53.64s)]
*  I go, what if everybody loads up defensively on him and no one else is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=54.6s)]
*  scoring and Conley or McDaniels can't get anything going on and Rudy's not an [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=58.44s)]
*  option and who knows what to expect with Kat. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=62.04s)]
*  I was like, it's not going to be his fault. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=65.28s)]
*  It's not going to be his fault. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=66.56s)]
*  And the beauty of this team through this series, at least was we know the defense [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=68.44s)]
*  was going to travel for every game, but there was these little pockets where, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=73.56s)]
*  I don't know if Conley was bad tonight, but Conley got Grayson Allen for like a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=77.56s)]
*  half straight, you know, towns. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=80.4s)]
*  When you looked at his numbers now, you're like, wow, he scored a ton. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  McDaniels had a huge night in there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Alexander Walker seems to hit all sorts of shots. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=87.12s)]
*  If you leave Rudy, you know, look, we know he's not on offensive side. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=89.48s)]
*  The point of this is then Ant would just say, okay, you know what though? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=92.56s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=95.76s)]
*  Thank you to everyone. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=96.68s)]
*  Thanks for the help. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=98.48s)]
*  But this quarter is mine. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=99.68s)]
*  Well, and you know, when it's about to happen, like when it's in progress, it's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  like when you go to the movies and they start showing the previews and you're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  like, oh, the lights are dimming. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=111.68s)]
*  The movie's going to start now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=112.76s)]
*  And he hits like that first shot and you're like, is it, is this, are we, are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=114.68s)]
*  we going to have a little run here? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=119.28s)]
*  And then, then it happens. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  It's like an alert. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=122.64s)]
*  And he hits it going on both ends. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=124.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  Like Marty Fish, a tennis player, I guess, just an unbelievable golfer as well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=125.36s)]
*  Tough life. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=133.16s)]
*  But anytime something's happening during the regular season, we just have a code. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=134.36s)]
*  Now he's a huge Timberwolves fan, so he's just texting me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=137.72s)]
*  We have this alert code for Ant and it's probably like in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=141.04s)]
*  beginning of the Golden State thing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=145.12s)]
*  We're like, do you see what's happening tonight? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=146.6s)]
*  Like, have you paid attention where everybody who's just a league pass [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=148.36s)]
*  junkie, like this is what it's supposed to be like, but we're so hard on the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=151.2s)]
*  superstars because we kind of want it to happen all the time, like Ant's first [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=155.4s)]
*  half, you know, like, oh, what's going on with him, what's good, but with him, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=159.4s)]
*  I'm like, whatever, it doesn't matter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=162.12s)]
*  And then he and Booker go toe to toe for the third quarter. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=164.8s)]
*  And then to see Ant, like, I don't know that I've had a playoff game. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  There was 141 left, Bill, and it was 117, 113, and it was the least drama I felt. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=171.44s)]
*  It was just like, whatever. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Like, the sun's mistakenly fouled because they thought there was 20 seconds left. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=182.44s)]
*  They said, now you guys have a hundred seconds left. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=185.92s)]
*  Ant hit a 28 footer with 534 left to make the score 105, 101 Minnesota. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  And it was a bomb. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=194.04s)]
*  And that was the official Ant alert. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=195.92s)]
*  It was like, uh, oh, here we go. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=197.84s)]
*  And then he just kept making chats. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=199.4s)]
*  He basically turned Beal into a summer meme over the course of the fourth [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  quarter, Bill, I just could not have been worse tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=208.16s)]
*  I mean, it was an iconic, awful game. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  It was such a bad game that we were texting about what a bad game he was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=213.68s)]
*  having before the end of the game. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=217.12s)]
*  When he had two straight turnovers, gave up the monster dunk to Ant and then [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=219.2s)]
*  fouled out 50 feet from the basket. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  He, it just like Ant and, uh, just ruined him tonight, but 40 points, 31 in the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=226.08s)]
*  second half, and it was the same thing as game three, which we didn't talk about. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=232.4s)]
*  And part one, there was a, like an alpha thing going on in the game where a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=236.32s)]
*  control of the surroundings that I got to say it, it reminded me a little Jordan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=242.84s)]
*  I don't think it's like, I don't feel like that's like a crazy thing to say. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=249.84s)]
*  Something about the superior athleticism combined with the moment combined with [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=254.12s)]
*  him really just wanting to kill the other team, he said in the interview after he [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=260.96s)]
*  was like, I just want to kill, but he said it tonight to the TNT guys at the end. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=264.84s)]
*  He's like, I told you all, I just want to, I just want to kill everybody [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=268.72s)]
*  and get them out of my way. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=272.16s)]
*  Like that's how he's wired that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=273.08s)]
*  And this is the stuff that we love. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=275.0s)]
*  So we'll see where it goes, but age 22, this is pretty good. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=276.88s)]
*  Cause I was trying to think of like who it's one round, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=280.84s)]
*  But it's like, who comes into the league where it's already understood? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=284.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=291.76s)]
*  This is his team. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  And I'm not talking about like Jaylen Green sophomore season with the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  Rockets where they're not good and he's taking 20 shots a game. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=297.4s)]
*  And again, to update the Jaylen Green stuff, we felt really good about him at [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=300.2s)]
*  the close of this year. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  So there's younger players that are really talented that we've seen put up [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=304.96s)]
*  huge numbers and you're like, okay, well, this guy's the number one option. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  You're like, okay, but what does it really mean? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=311.24s)]
*  Like this team has a chance to do something really special this year. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=313.04s)]
*  I don't know what to make of these teams in the West. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Like I got to pick somebody, but I don't know. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=318.6s)]
*  It feels more wide open than it did two weeks ago for them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  But, but in a, yeah, but I think in a, in a way of like, yeah, in a good way. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  And you know, the offense, there was just a lot of times it was like, okay, if [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=330.48s)]
*  they have their one Achilles heel, like what could it possibly be? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=334.56s)]
*  But then I start thinking about how they have enough size with Jokic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, but with this Murray situation, is there going to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=339.56s)]
*  be enough wing scoring if you're going to have a third guy kind of step up [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  offensively for Minnesota, then that changes the landscape of like what I [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  even think is possible for them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=350.24s)]
*  But back to the end point, of course there's LeBron where it was fairly [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  apparent this minute he suited up that it was going to be his team. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=355.8s)]
*  And then he started doing some really cool stuff early on. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=359.12s)]
*  And that was oh seven against the Pistons was the moment. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  And I don't know if this, I don't know if this is the right time to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  this, I'm not ready to say this was the moment for Ant, but it was, it only [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=366.64s)]
*  reminded me of like watching TV going. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=371.84s)]
*  That was the Eastern Conference finals. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=374.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=374.92s)]
*  It was 25 straight points and it was a much tougher opponent. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=375.16s)]
*  But he had a couple of checkpoints leading up to that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=380.16s)]
*  And the point is that Ant's hitting those checkpoints leading up to that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=383.2s)]
*  And now to me it's conceivable that he could go against Denver and knock out [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=386.4s)]
*  Jokic, it's conceivable. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=390.76s)]
*  I wouldn't predict it, but it's conceivable. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=392.32s)]
*  And by the way, Rossello, this starts with the team USA last summer, which [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=394.92s)]
*  he goes in and they don't realize that it's going to become his team. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=401.24s)]
*  But over the course of whatever they slowly realized like, oh shit, we [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=405.6s)]
*  can't keep this guy off the court. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=409.96s)]
*  And then it spreads to the season and it just keeps going, kept climbing the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=411.92s)]
*  ladder and then he's going against his hero in this series, which he talked [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=416.28s)]
*  about in all the right ways, like with the right amount of respect, but also [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=419.52s)]
*  like, I also want to beat this guy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=423.24s)]
*  He said that the interview after it's like, I can't wait to play with him this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=424.56s)]
*  summer for team USA and give him shit that I, that I sent him home, you know? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=428.12s)]
*  Hey, it's just, there's a spirit to him that I think the league really needs. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=432.6s)]
*  That's the part that is scary about like how big of a deal he can be as far as a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=437.72s)]
*  superstar, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=442.36s)]
*  Wade, I think is another good comparison. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=443.32s)]
*  At least Wade was in his third year when they won that title and he was the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  reason why it happened. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  I think more so than any single player on the heat team. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=450.36s)]
*  I don't think that's really even debatable, but you know, the beginning of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=452.28s)]
*  the year when, well, maybe it wasn't the beginning of the year when he had the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=455.44s)]
*  John Collins dunk, I had like, I think I've had three monologues on Ant. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=458.28s)]
*  So if this was sports illustrated cover, like keeping track of him this season, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=461.88s)]
*  I've had more monologues on Ant than probably any other player in the NBA. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=466.23999999999995s)]
*  And I had this one where I was talking about like, look, his game is the most [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  aesthetically pleasing. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=475.08s)]
*  Like this is what you want every awesome basketball player to be able to do. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=476.28s)]
*  Like hit all the shots, show supreme athleticism and a floor full of the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=479.72s)]
*  world's best athletes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  And then also just have these Sean Kemp, like I want to insult your family type [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  dunks mixed into all of these other things that he does. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=488.72s)]
*  But then the personality, yeah. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=491.48s)]
*  And the defense where he has moments where I'd be like, wait, is that McDaniel's? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God, Ant, no, Ant picked him up over half court. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=497.76s)]
*  And now he's like, I'm going to take you apart. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=500.8s)]
*  And then he's also like fun. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=503.12s)]
*  He feels a hundred percent real in this world where you're just so aware of your [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=505.52s)]
*  surroundings at such a young age when you have any kind of profile. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=509.92s)]
*  He doesn't, it doesn't seem like any of that bothers them whatsoever. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=513.24s)]
*  And I was just raving and raving and raving about him. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=515.92s)]
*  And they actually put my quote up at the Minneapolis airport. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=517.92s)]
*  Oh, and yeah, I know. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  And then he had the dunk against Collins where I did another open of just like he [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=525.08s)]
*  makes me feel like a kid again when I'm watching him do all these things. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=528.4s)]
*  But like, look, the dunks, the athleticism, the attitude, the quotes, all [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  the growth of his game is what should scare the rest of the league. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=535.92s)]
*  The fact that he, you know, this year when I was watching these drives and it [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  wasn't like, all right, maybe I'll get fouled and get some free throws. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=545.68s)]
*  And he actually doesn't get much of a superstar whistle at all. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=548.12s)]
*  But these kick outs, the trust that he still has with his teammates. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=551.12s)]
*  He had a play late tonight where he got bottled up. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  He grabbed the offensive rebound when no one thought he could get it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=558.16s)]
*  He got trapped in the corner and he got out of the trap and still made a pass. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=561.16s)]
*  And then Minnesota kind of screwed it up, but there's, there's an understanding [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=564.84s)]
*  of the game that he seems to have also that combines with this personality where [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=569.52s)]
*  all these older players are totally cool with him being the alpha, like he laughs [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=573.76s)]
*  at Katz jokes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=578.72s)]
*  Well, and he also, he shouts out the teammates in every interview, which I was [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=580.96s)]
*  love. I told you, I went to that game, the Laker game a couple of weeks ago, and I [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=584.28s)]
*  was so impressed with the patience that he had offensively, but then just seeing [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=588.4s)]
*  it in person, how he deals, how he deals with everyone on his team and what a [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=593.0s)]
*  force he is around the hat. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=599.04s)]
*  Everything feeds off him, like everything. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=600.84s)]
*  And you just know it when you see it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=602.88s)]
*  I think it's been the best thing that ever happened to Towns. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=605.0s)]
*  Towns was great tonight. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, and Towns is somebody that there's an alternate universe where he just [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=608.76s)]
*  never has an important playoff moment in his career, you know, and he just becomes [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  your typical frustrating, talented, but guy who let you down in the NBA playoffs [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=616.04s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=621.16s)]
*  I thought he was really good tonight. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=621.92s)]
*  And since he's come back, I've noticed his passing, not saying it wasn't there [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=624.08s)]
*  before, but he's a more willing passer. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=629.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=631.92s)]
*  I mean, look, no one's, you're not going to love him. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=632.44s)]
*  I mean, you had a tweet the other day about his, his bad fouls. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=634.32s)]
*  He had three terrible fouls helped him in the bonus. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=637.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=640.36s)]
*  He had a foul that was in the bonus at 3 41 when Phoenix couldn't score him. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=640.68s)]
*  Once Rudy got back in and you were just like, what, what are you doing? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=644.12s)]
*  I also think Towns leads the league in weirdness per 36, but he is, you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=647.44s)]
*  gotta keep scrolling over, but Towns was awesome. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=654.2800000000001s)]
*  And if you think about the player that like would be the prototypical roster fit, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  they're like, okay, well, and can kind of score all these different levels, but you [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=664.6s)]
*  need some spacing, but it's like, wait, they have Rudy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=667.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, they have to have a stretch four. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=670.08s)]
*  It's just that Towns at one point probably thought he was going to be in the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=671.76s)]
*  hall of fame and who knows the basketball hall of fame and probably still get in. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=674.0s)]
*  But you know, Towns, okay, we could have go back to do what you want to do and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=676.8s)]
*  take 20 shots game last time. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=681.32s)]
*  We're not really going to win, you know, defensively Towns is always a mess. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=682.72s)]
*  And now it's like everything, this, this rising tide thing of this entire team [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=686.6s)]
*  has been incredible and the offensive concerns I would have late against another [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=691.6s)]
*  really good team type in the playoffs. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=695.32s)]
*  It was never even an issue here. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=696.68s)]
*  Phoenix felt helpless against them. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=698.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=701.28s)]
*  That this was Towns really first, really good playoff game of the series. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=702.64s)]
*  Now they didn't totally need them before, but I am just so upset that I, I'm [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=706.8399999999999s)]
*  never doing this again. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=713.64s)]
*  Just remind me next year when we're doing podcasts in the last 10 days of the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=714.68s)]
*  season, I'm never overreacting to the last week of the season again. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=717.76s)]
*  I'm not doing it because watching, watching the sons beat this team nine days [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  apart at the end of the year really messed me up. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=726.28s)]
*  I really liked the T Wolves. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=729.3199999999999s)]
*  I bet on them 16 to one to make the finals against the Celtics like two weeks [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=730.88s)]
*  before the end of the season. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=736.08s)]
*  And by the time the playoffs are starting, I'm like, yeah, Phoenix is going [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=737.56s)]
*  to beat him, just a bad matchup, like no thought at all put into it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=740.04s)]
*  And then you watch these games and it's like, they're way bigger. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=743.12s)]
*  Ant's the best part on the floor. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=746.56s)]
*  Phoenix's depth and the bail issue, which we'll talk about a little later, like [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=748.84s)]
*  just kind of mushroomed into this awful thing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=753.36s)]
*  Their body language was awful. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=756.16s)]
*  You could see it today. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=758.16s)]
*  They were dying to fall apart in that game today. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=759.16s)]
*  You could feel it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=761.76s)]
*  I thought this was way more like the way you're talking about it though. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=762.76s)]
*  I thought Phoenix was way more impressive than my expectations for this game down [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=766.4s)]
*  three Oh yeah, that well, cause it, cause who was impressive. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=770.16s)]
*  It was Booker and KD. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=775.28s)]
*  Both of those guys were at least like, we're not going down this way. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=775.68s)]
*  Nobody else showed up, but those two guys were great. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, Bill, Bill had one of the worst backs to the walls games. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=782.8s)]
*  I don't, it's just, it's always going to be mentioned when we were going to be [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=787.64s)]
*  talking about him this summer and we were calling a Bradley Beals, not expiring [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=791.16s)]
*  contract, and we're just going to mention this game. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=794.52s)]
*  What did he end with? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  Did he even get to 10 points? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=797.96s)]
*  So he got to nine, which is shocking. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  He had nine points, two assists, one rebound. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=801.76s)]
*  He was four for 13. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=804.24s)]
*  He had six turnovers and he fouled out and had an incident with Vogel where he ran [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=805.72s)]
*  by him and kind of like stiffed him on a handshake that went viral on Twitter. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=810.72s)]
*  Other than that, a pretty good game. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=814.8s)]
*  The numbers don't do it justice. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=817.24s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=819.0s)]
*  This is one of the special, terrible games of anyone with a profile. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=819.76s)]
*  At one point I wrote down his line. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=825.7199999999999s)]
*  He had two personal fouls, zero points, zero rebounds, zero assists, two turnovers. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=827.4s)]
*  And I was like, okay, it looks like he's going for the Tony Snell tonight. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=831.92s)]
*  And because of the fouls, you know, they ended up having to go to the bench a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=837.24s)]
*  little bit earlier because Nurkic had two fouls and then he went to the bench. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  And then Phoenix was just like, look, we're going to go small. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=844.32s)]
*  I think they were going to try to go small at some point anyway. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  But the problem is when you go that small, even though it was a really tight [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=849.0s)]
*  whistle, I think throughout most of the game, when you're small, you're just [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=852.0s)]
*  going to end up, you're just going to end up fouling in a bunch of spots you [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  don't normally want to because there's just nothing you can do physically. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=860.0s)]
*  And so like, it's like, okay, well, Beale will come in. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=862.44s)]
*  He can't be this bad in the second half. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=866.7600000000001s)]
*  And he was, and you know, you mentioned those turnovers. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=869.44s)]
*  They were, they were like super turnovers. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=874.5200000000001s)]
*  They weren't just your typical NBA turnovers. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  They were, they were like truly horrible. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=879.08s)]
*  And it was still 110-109. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=881.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=885.4000000000001s)]
*  So it's 110-109 and Beale goes to throw it cross court to KD. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=885.6400000000001s)]
*  Who's not even looking at it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=892.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=894.08s)]
*  He nails him in the shoulder. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=894.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=896.72s)]
*  So it turns into a turnover, but then Conley can't corral the ball. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=896.9200000000001s)]
*  Phoenix goes back to the other way. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=900.84s)]
*  He had two other turnovers after that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=902.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=905.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=905.4s)]
*  So then during this, this melee of getting the ball, Phoenix brings it [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=906.04s)]
*  across and because of the scramble, Beale's wide open at the top of the key. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=910.8399999999999s)]
*  And I always like, every time a shot goes up, it's pretty nauseating [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  to do it as often as I do. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=922.52s)]
*  I'll just make myself say whether or not I think it's going in or not. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=923.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=927.7199999999999s)]
*  And sometimes like I'll look at the guy's feet or his hands. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=928.4s)]
*  I'll just be like, no, yep. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=930.72s)]
*  Nope. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=931.88s)]
*  Yep. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=932.24s)]
*  When he, when he caught it, I was like, out loud by myself. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=933.64s)]
*  I'm like, there's no fucking, there is no shot attempted this weekend. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=938.32s)]
*  I have been less confident in than this one. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  And maybe a precious at shoot a 15 footer and game 15 footer, two three. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=947.1600000000001s)]
*  Uh, the, the handshake thing with Vogel, although look, Beale during the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=952.96s)]
*  wizard's years had some real like all NBA pout team where it's like, Hey man, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=958.08s)]
*  I know you put up huge numbers and you're really talented at everything, but [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=965.5600000000001s)]
*  like the team always kinds of kind of stinks in, and it's a little on you. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  I know they had the run in 17 and then the flirtation with the playoffs there [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=972.6s)]
*  with the Westbrook year when Westbrook put a big numbers, but there was always [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=975.64s)]
*  this element of Beale where you were like, who are you mad at? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=978.9200000000001s)]
*  Like what, what, what are you up to? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=982.72s)]
*  And you did the extension too. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=985.12s)]
*  You got the extra money. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=986.48s)]
*  You got the extra year, which is what everybody kind of saying, like deep [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=987.5600000000001s)]
*  down, he wanted to do all these things. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=989.96s)]
*  So then when he comes off the court though, with Vogel to be fair to him, I [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=991.4000000000001s)]
*  think he's so incredibly frustrated with himself because nothing's working out. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=995.0s)]
*  And he's picking up a foul like every two or three minutes. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=998.6400000000001s)]
*  I think it was almost like Vogel going, Hey, give me five. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1001.5200000000001s)]
*  And anyone with any pride is like, I don't want a five right now. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1005.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1008.8800000000001s)]
*  Like I don't want one. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1009.08s)]
*  So I'm gonna go to my room and put on pink Floyd. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1010.12s)]
*  Um, he was, he was singularly atrocious tonight. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1013.32s)]
*  It was really rough. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1020.7600000000001s)]
*  Um, it's kind of our job to never forget. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1021.7600000000001s)]
*  Listen, I said last year when they made the trade, I thought it was a dumb trade. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1026.72s)]
*  I didn't think it would make much of a difference for them long-term. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1031.8400000000001s)]
*  And I said, if they had had Beale instead of Shamett against Ember last year, I [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1035.4s)]
*  still think they lose this year. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1039.64s)]
*  If they had Shamett instead of Beale, maybe this goes five. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1042.28s)]
*  I didn't even been able to sneak it to six. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1048.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1050.84s)]
*  I did the Shamett face make a difference? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1051.6s)]
*  Look, I don't love Beale, but he was for, he was free. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1054.84s)]
*  He was, he was free. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1060.28s)]
*  But he wasn't totally free though, because they, it was the Chris Paul [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1062.24s)]
*  expiring, which they could have used in February to try to get a better asset [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1065.12s)]
*  than this Bradley Beale contract that now is almost 54 million. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1070.04s)]
*  Maybe, but the biggest headliner for this trade deadline was Bogdanovich wasn't [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1075.72s)]
*  even part of the closing group for the Knicks. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, fair. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1082.1200000000001s)]
*  But maybe they could have gotten Zach Levine in November. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1082.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1085.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1085.44s)]
*  Yeah, that would have fixed everything. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1086.08s)]
*  Would you want Zach Levine? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1086.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1087.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'd rather have Beale. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1088.4s)]
*  Well, they might, they might find out next year. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1093.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1096.08s)]
*  So Minnesota, Denver, and Denver still needs to win game five. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1096.32s)]
*  Murray will see if he plays, but do you feel differently about a Minnesota [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1102.36s)]
*  Denver series than you did two weeks ago? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1106.9199999999998s)]
*  Because I feel at least mildly different. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1110.24s)]
*  I would still pick Denver, but I'm hesitating now. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1114.76s)]
*  I don't want to get caught up in this because I also think Phoenix is a mess. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1120.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1124.8s)]
*  And you could even see it in the beginning, like some of the stuff they were doing, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1125.44s)]
*  like Nurkic came over with cat that said, or excuse me, Nurkic came over with Rudy [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1128.32s)]
*  to set a screen for Katie and Katie's like, get out of here. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1133.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1136.44s)]
*  I don't want to switch into Rudy. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1136.64s)]
*  I've got cat on me. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1138.56s)]
*  Then there was another play where Booker didn't have McDaniels on him. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1139.52s)]
*  And then O'Neill came over to set the screen where then he'd be switching to [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1143.24s)]
*  McDaniels and Booker's like, no, get, get away. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1147.04s)]
*  And I'm watching this to start a game four. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1149.52s)]
*  It was like two of the first five plays they ran. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm thinking like, are you guys still this screwed up? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1154.08s)]
*  And there's a bunch of examples of that, of just like, we, there was another play [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1157.76s)]
*  too, where Booker took his guy into the corner and then Gordon had Conley on him. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1161.44s)]
*  And Katie had a better defender on him. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1168.1599999999999s)]
*  And Booker had to be like, Hey, set a screen for Katie at the break because [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  they're going to get a switch into Conley. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1173.84s)]
*  It was like, Oh yeah, great idea. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1175.56s)]
*  So anyway. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1177.08s)]
*  Well, the reason I asked that question is because two years ago, a team built [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1178.2s)]
*  around some young stars that thought they're going to be in a dogfight in round [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1182.68s)]
*  one against a team that they allegedly didn't match up that great against was [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  the Boston Celtics playing Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets stole game one at [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1190.72s)]
*  the end, sweeps them, goes on to make the finals. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1196.04s)]
*  And at some point over that series. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1200.48s)]
*  Passed some invisible point and rounded into some different better version [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1205.3600000000001s)]
*  of themselves, and I'm wondering if that happened with Minnesota. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it's a really good comp too, because Brooklyn was messed up. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1213.52s)]
*  And they also Kevin Durant. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1217.6000000000001s)]
*  Can we just before we get into the Minnesota Denver thing, spend some time on Durant? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1219.72s)]
*  Cause we haven't really done it yet. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1225.8s)]
*  Yeah, it hurts, but I'm ready to do it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1228.0800000000002s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1230.92s)]
*  Cause he got swept this year, last year lost, forced his way out of Brooklyn, ends [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1231.2s)]
*  up losing in round one year before it gets swept. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  Year before foot on the line against Milwaukee year before no playoffs. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1242.8s)]
*  You made it to the finals. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1247.48s)]
*  Round two. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1249.5600000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, yeah, I mean, when you think of where he was in 2019 before here at his calf, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1250.92s)]
*  um, when he was averaging 35 a game, the first series and a half he was in that [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1258.1200000000001s)]
*  Houston series and he just was unequivocally the best player in the world. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1261.92s)]
*  And since then he's been one of the best 10 to 12 players in the world, but has [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1266.48s)]
*  not been at that same level and, um, now he's gonna be 36 years old next year. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1270.88s)]
*  I don't love the situation is in. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1276.88s)]
*  I don't know how they improve the team and we'll see if he stays. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1278.4s)]
*  Not great though. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1282.64s)]
*  Not, not, not a great, uh, not a great last five years for Silla. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1283.5200000000002s)]
*  I don't feel good about it to answer your question. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1291.68s)]
*  The whole thing feels pretty ugly. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1294.92s)]
*  Cause last year they got the scare from LA Clippers, but then, you know, George [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1296.24s)]
*  isn't playing for why it gets hurt. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1302.16s)]
*  And then they're basically like, Hey, Westbrook, like let's go. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1303.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1306.2s)]
*  See Westbrook. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1306.52s)]
*  You get all this possessions Westbrook puts up big numbers. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  It still ends up only being a five game series. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1310.24s)]
*  And then they get two, two with Denver. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1313.24s)]
*  And if you remember, like Booker was going crazy. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1315.76s)]
*  One of those games, what did they average? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1319.6000000000001s)]
*  They scored like a hundred points combined or like 90 points combined [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1321.28s)]
*  at game three with some crazy number. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1325.8s)]
*  No, it's a, it's, it's an absurd number. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1328.8s)]
*  So it's 86, 86 Booker went 20, a 25 for 47 points and nine assists. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1330.68s)]
*  Three turnovers. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1339.36s)]
*  And then just turned it on the next day. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1340.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1342.96s)]
*  And then in that series, cause you're kind of like, all right, well, they got [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1343.28s)]
*  it to six with the eventual champs. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1345.64s)]
*  It's like, I can't believe they got blasted in three of those games, but you [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1347.24s)]
*  don't think that this is happening. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1350.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1352.52s)]
*  And then you're probably thinking, all right, well, the Randall have been here [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1352.76s)]
*  longer, they'll figure it all out. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1356.12s)]
*  We'll have these three guys that are really good scores. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1357.8s)]
*  Like that's what really matters in the playoffs. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1360.72s)]
*  And I can't help, but think of like this, whatever this chapter is wrong with the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1363.4s)]
*  rant, like it's got to count for something because I thought he was really good [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1369.96s)]
*  tonight, but man, you know, watching aunt just take over these quarters. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1375.72s)]
*  And you're going, shouldn't Duran have like a couple of these quarters? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1381.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1384.8799999999999s)]
*  And it's not so much even about the sweep. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1385.4s)]
*  Now I don't know if I'm missing something because the overall numbers, like, look, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1387.08s)]
*  when you're, when you're a one or two option, you're still going to get your 20 [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1391.28s)]
*  plus points. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1394.04s)]
*  But this was the case of the Boston series two years ago. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1395.28s)]
*  I remember Tatum was just better than him for a week and a half. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1397.68s)]
*  Stout played him. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1402.92s)]
*  The last time he was really at the level you're talking about was that Buck series. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1404.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1408.28s)]
*  And that was in 2021, which is three years ago, but you know, he's 2007 draft. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1409.48s)]
*  He's been in the league. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  Is this his 17th season? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1416.76s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1418.96s)]
*  So that the guy that we have in our heads, just because it's this weird thing that [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1420.32s)]
*  happens sometimes in sports where the guy gets older, but he looks exactly like. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1425.0s)]
*  I remember this happened with Jerry Weiss where it wasn't really Jerry Rice [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1429.68s)]
*  anymore, but it still looked like Jerry Rice. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1432.44s)]
*  So you're like, Oh, it's still Jerry Wright when he was on the Raiders, but it [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1434.16s)]
*  wasn't really Jerry Rice anymore. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1436.36s)]
*  Um, I don't think that's the case with Katie because Katie is still [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1437.56s)]
*  statistically was awesome. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1440.2s)]
*  But what you're talking about is there's like a five, 6%. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1442.52s)]
*  I declined the wrong word, but he's just not, he can't match baskets with somebody [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1447.72s)]
*  like Ant in the same way when he had feeling like that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1453.96s)]
*  It's like, Durant's not like, okay, now I'm going to throw some punches. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  We don't see that in the same way. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1460.1599999999999s)]
*  And maybe it's part of like, it's part of Booker's he's on Booker's team too. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1461.6s)]
*  And maybe he, maybe there's stuff he doesn't want to like do from a [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1465.52s)]
*  takeover standpoint, I don't know. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1468.48s)]
*  Maybe he's just older, but I'm with you. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  They it's, there's something slightly disappointing about it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1473.84s)]
*  And he went for 30 twice. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1477.8s)]
*  Game two was bad. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1480.44s)]
*  You know, he ends up with 25 for the shooting numbers are fine, except for three. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1482.76s)]
*  But I mean, his shooting splits are still exactly what you'd expect him to be. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1487.4s)]
*  55, 42 gets to the free throw line a bunch. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1490.32s)]
*  My idea of what he is, the idea of what Ishby thought he was doing when he makes [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1493.88s)]
*  this trade, because I don't blame an owner for being like, if I just say yes right now, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1498.6000000000001s)]
*  I get Kevin Durant on my basketball team. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1503.0s)]
*  But to watch it feel like it's like, oh, okay. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1506.44s)]
*  He got some, he got some numbers, but like, when was, when was it so clear [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1510.3200000000002s)]
*  he was the best player? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1513.88s)]
*  When did it seem like he was completely in control that the other [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  team had no answer for him? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  And it just doesn't feel like that enough with him. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1519.48s)]
*  And it just doesn't feel like that enough with him, especially when there's a guy [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1521.72s)]
*  on the other team that's doing those things. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1525.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1527.96s)]
*  Well, and there's also more good offensive players now. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1529.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1532.36s)]
*  You know, that might be a small piece of it, but they never figured out. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1533.12s)]
*  One of the things I thought the sons is they never figured out what their best [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1537.6399999999999s)]
*  five was and what that looked like. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1540.48s)]
*  And sometimes I almost thought in my head, maybe it was Durene at the five, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1541.9199999999998s)]
*  which is the matchup. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1545.56s)]
*  That was the lineup I thought they were going to go at. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1546.96s)]
*  In this, uh, Minnesota series to try to like turn it on Minnesota a little [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1549.8400000000001s)]
*  bit, a little smaller, little golden state 2017 ish, but it just didn't work. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1554.4s)]
*  Um, this game, this game was so bad for everybody that, I mean, nobody [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1561.0s)]
*  else had double figures and nobody could hang onto the basketball. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1563.88s)]
*  There's just so many moments in these games. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1568.0s)]
*  You're like, what are you guys doing? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1569.64s)]
*  And then guys get scared to shoot on top of everything else. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1570.72s)]
*  I mean, I'm really, I'm surprised. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  Can I say something that's really important? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1574.7600000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to listen. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1577.64s)]
*  Cause this happened with the 2011 heat too. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1579.8400000000001s)]
*  And every once in a while, these teams, they load up with the two or the three [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1582.24s)]
*  expensive guys, and then they're like, no, we're going to be able to build around [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1587.8000000000002s)]
*  these guys and we're, we're, we're smarter than everybody else. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1592.64s)]
*  We're going to be able to build, you know, we'll find, we'll find eight. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1595.6000000000001s)]
*  You only need like four or five more role players and we're going to be great. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1598.44s)]
*  And then we get to a situation like this and it's like, yeah, we, we just [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1603.2800000000002s)]
*  didn't have enough around those guys. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1606.48s)]
*  We got to really build around. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1607.84s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, this is what happens when you spend $150 million on three guys. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1609.0s)]
*  You end up with like Josh Okogi in big spots, you know, you end up with no [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1615.1999999999998s)]
*  point card, you just don't have a point card. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1619.9199999999998s)]
*  I do think they miss Grayson and I'm not, maybe he would have swung one game and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1621.9599999999998s)]
*  they lucked out with the fact that Grayson was so good this year, considering [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1625.9599999999998s)]
*  where I think all of us were on him heading into that trade. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1629.36s)]
*  But when you go all in on guys, I've been saying this with the Lakers, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  too, like you, you know, you're going to spend 105 million on Davis and LeBron. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1637.72s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1642.0s)]
*  You got to roll the dice with D'Angelo Russell. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1642.48s)]
*  You know, you got to roll the dice with Rui Hachimora. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1645.2s)]
*  That's how it goes. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1647.44s)]
*  You're not just going to be able to build a super team. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1648.28s)]
*  So I think people forget that over and over again. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1650.88s)]
*  It's, it's really with the situation you want to be in is like where [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1653.6s)]
*  Minnesota was where they at least were able to draft a couple of the guys they [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1658.6s)]
*  had, that's where, where Boston was, where Denver was, where you have some of [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1662.68s)]
*  these guys on your team already when you're, then you're building around that [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1665.92s)]
*  versus where Phoenix is, where the only guy that's, you know, as a homegrown [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1670.24s)]
*  guy is, is Booker. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1674.4s)]
*  Everyone else is gone or the traded or like, do you think about like that [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1676.52s)]
*  Jalen Smith that could have been Hal Burton, all of these moments that they [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1679.92s)]
*  had to build the team around, they just didn't have it. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1683.3600000000001s)]
*  No, and especially getting rid of Bridges and, you know, Cam and then, you [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1686.76s)]
*  know, the Durant trade, or I don't know if we're doing any of this now, but [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1691.92s)]
*  or you bring up that Miami comparison, at least they were losing to Dallas [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1696.88s)]
*  in the NBA finals. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1699.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1701.0s)]
*  And you still, if you're Riley, you're like, what can we do? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1701.44s)]
*  Like, okay, we'll, we'll put those three guys together and we'll figure out the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1704.68s)]
*  rest of it a little bit later on. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1708.76s)]
*  But they really had the five cause they also had Mike Miller and they had [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1710.52s)]
*  Haslam and they had Chalmers like on paper that made more sense than that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1714.0s)]
*  But then when it actually got into it, they didn't have Dallas had more depth [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1720.0s)]
*  and LeBron sucked in the finals and that was good. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1724.04s)]
*  And, but once they added Ray Allen, it, you know, I don't, you know, when I [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1727.04s)]
*  looked at that team and you go like, oh, they could have done it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1732.96s)]
*  I mean, you made it to the four straight finals. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1735.16s)]
*  Um, we're talking about a team that just got swept. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1736.8s)]
*  And I was thinking about one, right. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1739.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1741.44s)]
*  And I was thinking about the story cause you and I were both doing, you know, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1741.68s)]
*  it's not the Vegas Superbowl. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1745.76s)]
*  I was in Phoenix for that one, cause it was a trade deadline. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1747.4s)]
*  You were texting being like, I think this is happening. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1750.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1753.84s)]
*  And then we tape the pod and you're kind of like, I know I just can't help myself [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1754.0s)]
*  in that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1758.52s)]
*  I'm like, okay, well you just added Kevin Durant, but then when the stories started [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1758.76s)]
*  coming out a little bit more about how it went down, it's like, well, Durant was [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1762.8799999999999s)]
*  adamant that he didn't want to turn it into some open market thing. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1766.28s)]
*  And I'm like, well, if I'm the nets, I'm going, well, we just, your four year [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1769.56s)]
*  extension just kicked in. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1773.8799999999999s)]
*  You wanted the coach. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1775.28s)]
*  You wanted me fired. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1776.16s)]
*  So, you know, Apologies if we don't want to fucking acquiesce to every one of your [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1777.2s)]
*  demands here because you're burning us with a four year extension left on this [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1781.92s)]
*  thing. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1785.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1786.28s)]
*  So we knew that part of it, or at least the part that was told. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1786.52s)]
*  And then you think of what was given up and you go, okay, so then it's all these [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1790.04s)]
*  firsts because it just feels like anybody of this magnitude is like the four first [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1793.44s)]
*  and maybe a swap on top of everything else. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, but it's also Cam Johnson, who's a nice role player. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1799.8400000000001s)]
*  And then it's Mikael who, you know, felt better about last year. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1804.1200000000001s)]
*  I'd still think there's a lot of stock in, in bridges. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1807.88s)]
*  And you're like, but who are you bidding against if the rant was saying that I [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1811.0800000000002s)]
*  only wanted to do this way? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1814.44s)]
*  I mean, did you just get worked? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1816.48s)]
*  Well, when we, when we did the pot after, I think we both said, yeah, you kind of [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1818.76s)]
*  have to do it. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1823.52s)]
*  You have to get Kevin. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1824.1200000000001s)]
*  I know I said it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1824.92s)]
*  I know I said it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1825.88s)]
*  So we both said it, but we also said, that's a lot and you don't have a lot of [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1826.64s)]
*  outs now, like if this doesn't a hundred percent work, there's not a lot of moves [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1832.8s)]
*  left. If these two guys don't work with Aiden and Paul, what's your next move? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1838.52s)]
*  And then when they did the bill thing, that was the, I did not, I was out on the [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1843.76s)]
*  bill trade. I did not like it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1847.24s)]
*  And I thought they, all their outs. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1848.6s)]
*  Because like Durant leaves you less out. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1851.24s)]
*  So it's like, okay, we may as well add somebody in deal from a talent standpoint [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1853.08s)]
*  that is going to be better than the transaction for Nurkic and Grayson. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1856.68s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1861.28s)]
*  I just, I've done with eight and they were just, I get it. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1862.08s)]
*  But once they did all those moves, they had nothing left. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1864.76s)]
*  There were no other moves. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1867.44s)]
*  That's your team. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1868.8000000000002s)]
*  And now, and we're going to do the playoff panic draft that in our next break, but. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1870.0s)]
*  You know, we never answered the question. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1874.44s)]
*  I never answered the Minnesota Denver thing. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1875.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1878.0400000000002s)]
*  I know, I know what Minnesota will want to do, you know, with Rudy on Gordon to try [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1878.2800000000002s)]
*  to take away the lob threat. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1883.2800000000002s)]
*  And that can screw up Denver a little bit by having Gordon spaced as opposed to [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1884.68s)]
*  that dunker threat that destroys all these other teams. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1888.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1891.16s)]
*  Um, you know, ant like, is he going to do something really, really special here [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1891.44s)]
*  and take out the defending champs in the second round? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1897.8s)]
*  Like who are they going to have defend them? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1900.88s)]
*  Peyton Watson? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1902.8s)]
*  You know, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1904.52s)]
*  It'll be Pope, but it doesn't matter. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1906.16s)]
*  Like it was some of these guys. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1908.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1909.8s)]
*  It doesn't, um, it doesn't mean he's going to be shut down. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1911.28s)]
*  It just means things are going to be a little bit harder for him. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1913.6000000000001s)]
*  The same way they were harder for Booker's out this entire series until he could get [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  free in game four, but it was too late. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1918.0s)]
*  And that big third quarters, cause Rudy had foul trouble. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1919.52s)]
*  So Booker could drive the at will in this one. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1922.36s)]
*  So, yeah, so if I gave you Minnesota, Denver, OKC, Dallas, Boston, Orlando, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1925.72s)]
*  and Knicks, Indiana, it's pretty clear what series we're going to be the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1936.76s)]
*  most focused on out of those four. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1941.72s)]
*  Easily. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1943.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1944.16s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1946.56s)]
*  Minnesota, Denver will be the marquee series around too. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iXxwe0N_0&t=1947.52s)]
