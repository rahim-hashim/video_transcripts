# Are the Rockets For Real? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQlfmQ58ytU)
*  We got to talk about Houston because I mean, you love coaching.
*  You're a coach.
*  Your coach is coach.
*  You're one of the deans of the coaches.
*  So email goes in.
*  We don't have to talk about what happened in Boston, but goes to Houston.
*  Houston was a train wreck last year.
*  Like I'm sure.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sure when you're playing them, you're like, Hey guys, enjoy today.
*  They don't play defense and whoever gets the ball and the rockets over half
*  court just gets to shoot.
*  That's the rule.
*  And that's it.
*  It was, it was an AAU game.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a game.
*  And within three weeks, they look like a professional basketball team.
*  They're playing defense.
*  He's doing all that.
*  Like I love DMA when he was a Celtics coach.
*  I thought he did an awesome job because that was not an easy team to coach.
*  And he treated the dudes like men.
*  He yelled at them.
*  He got pissed.
*  Like he was just, he did a great job.
*  And I can already see it.
*  Like Jaylen green the other night, they still win Jaylen greens one in 13.
*  And there was a couple of times when he just pulls Jaylen green and he's like,
*  trying to motivate him, keep them focused, but he'll also chew them out if he has to.
*  Um, and then everything's running through Shangoon who grew two inches and now
*  it looks like discount yolkage, but I actually think this Houston team's kind of real.
*  I don't know.
*  I think they're at least a plan team, right?
*  Yeah, they are.
*  And, uh, listen, uh, Bring an email in and paying him.
*  Uh, and I know that sounds nuts, but it's very important, uh, and paying him and
*  giving them a five year deal told every player that not only there's a new
*  sheriff in town, but this year has two guns, uh, you know, he has two guns and
*  it's so important, uh, the messaging that, that franchises and organizations give.
*  Um, when you don't do that, let's say they, uh, you know, Steven Silas, who I
*  think could have been an excellent coach, didn't pay them a lot, never backed them.
*  Um, you know, came in with the new GM, but the new players, no chance, but he
*  had no chance in that situation.
*  And what it's like the Washington coach right now, like talk about a tough job.
*  Weston so junior.
*  Good luck on that team.
*  Yeah.
*  You got Jordan pool throwing towels already and, you know, um, and West, I'm
*  telling you, West is actually coach, but he's got to deal with this stuff.
*  And so he may comes in and he does two things.
*  Number one, the players knows he has two guns and number two, the organization
*  had, it looks like has gotten out of his way and said, you're going to be the
*  culture driver and you can tell, like he went out and got just ballers,
*  toughness and pros Jeff Green.
*  Now, no one talks about that.
*  It's a good sign.
*  Just an excellent guy in the locker room.
*  Um, right.
*  You know, um, this is, couldn't be a more perfect place for Brooks.
*  Brooks is nuts.
*  I love because he's nuts, but what he is, he's deadly serious about competition.
*  He's deadly serious bill about competition and these young players.
*  And this is something I'm telling you, we're going to have to talk about in
*  another show is these young American players better watch out because the
*  European players are better players coming into the league, they're better
*  prepared coming into the league and they're, they're competitors.
*  And a lot of our young guys are not, they play six games in a day.
*  You know, they come to the league and it's, they want to put on a show.
*  Uh, Kevin Garnett always told my story in the locker room.
*  Cause I would walk in every time we played in LA every single time.
*  All right.
*  This is not a show.
*  This is a competition.
*  Anybody here that wants to put on the show, Paul Hollywood actors,
*  you're not playing tonight.
*  This is going to be a competition.
*  And I think that's what Brooks brings.
*  That's what, that's what he made brains.
*  Uh, that's what Ben Fleet brains.
*  That's what Jeff Green brings.
*  And now these young guys are playing in games to compete.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're different.
*  They're just watching them.
*  Even the first week, they're like, man, they're different.
*  They have a different walk and they're playing right.
*  I don't know how good they can be out deep.
*  They are, but it's just great to see.
*  And, and Jalen green, I'm honest.
*  I didn't know if he could be this guy.
*  I didn't know.
*  I, I, the jury was out for me.
*  I'm like, can he ever turn into a serious basketball player or is his image and
*  doing all the other stuff more important watching him?
*  I think, I think he's going to turn into what we wanted him to turn into.
*  Oh, well he's lucky because he met EMA at the crucial point in his career.
*  I think there's another version where he's a good stats, bad team guy, but I
*  actually, I really like, I really like watching the Rockets.
*  I think that's one of my three or four favorite league past teams.
*  And I like what I've seen from him.
*  I he's doing stuff.
*  He can have a bad game and still impact the game, which I just don't think he
*  would have known how to do last year.
*  I'm glad you mentioned the competitive thing in the foreign.
*  I actually talked to Austin about the foreign player versus the culture
*  that we've created thing.
*  And, and even if you looked at team USA, like the guys on that team that stood
*  out, they all had these unconventional backgrounds.
*  They weren't like that typical.
*  I was in a use since age nine.
*  And then you see these foreign guys come in and I don't know.
*  I think there's something to it.
*  When we even somebody like Shen gun, these guys are tough.
*  They're competitive and it's, it's kind of the opposite of when you were playing.
*  We were like, ah, the foreign guys are soft.
*  Yeah, they all were soft.
*  Uh, most of you saw a foreign guy.
*  You had a good day.
*  That's a, you know, it's funny.
*  It's like the Larry Bird thing.
*  Are you going to put this guy on me?
*  This is embarrassing, you know, but, but you think about it and, uh, in our
*  conversation, I didn't even know this, but in our conversation yesterday, uh, it
*  was me and coach K, uh, uh, Nico Harrison, um, uh, Troy Weaver, uh, I mean,
*  there's a bunch of people on this thing.
*  And the one guy who charts the game says that the American players in the summer
*  high school kids play six games a week.
*  And they have one practice that you're playing.
*  Being players have one game a week and they have six practice.
*  I mean, that's, and then the second part is because you have all these games,
*  you stop being competitive.
*  I watched Austin play and you know, growing up and it hurt him.
*  Number one, this stupid ranking stuff.
*  You're the number one player in the country.
*  Who knows where you're at?
*  Uh, number two, you play three or four games in a day.
*  I used to drive me crazy because Austin would not even have time.
*  It wouldn't take a shot.
*  We just sit and I remember walking across the court one day and I
*  was not that type of barren.
*  I said, Hey, um, you're going to like, she's a free throw.
*  You're going to warm up.
*  You said that I got five more games today.
*  Right.
*  I'm going to play.
*  And that's the other thing I'm going to play 48 minutes because the
*  stars in the, you never come out.
*  They could be a 40.
*  They're not coming out.
*  And so it drove me nuts watching this and, and it's, it's even worse now.
*  And so it has to be fixed because we have the talent.
*  Um, what we've lost, the players are far more talented than we ever were.
*  It's not even close, but they don't know how to play.
*  They don't know how to play team basketball.
*  Everyone has these individual coaches.
*  Um, and in Europe, they have team coaches.
*  They do three on three stuff.
*  And we got to get back to that or I'm telling you American players,
*  you're going to lose jobs.
*  Who's the last five MVP?
*  You're off.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, my old guy, my old guy thing looks at it and goes, all right, well, part of
*  this is the season's too long.
*  And I know some people have, have said this where like talk to Steve Kerr about it.
*  When you have 82 games over six months and you're just moving from place to place,
*  you have no time to practice.
*  Right?
*  So you're kind of stuck with the team you have in November.
*  How are you going to change it?
*  There's no way to change it.
*  Now they fixed a couple of the things about it, but they haven't really fixed it.
*  And if they really gave a shit, the NBA, I think the schedule would be 70 games and
*  they would cut 12 out and it would just be a better product.
*  Yeah.
*  70 games would be great.
*  Uh, you know, the practice I'm talking more high school.
*  I know, but I'm saying even in the NBA, like you're still not practicing,
*  you're still not practicing enough.
*  Um, and when you do, you know, especially now, uh, and this is every coach I talk
*  to now, it's the same frustration.
*  You, you have a, you look at your schedule and you have three days off.
*  All right, man, we're gonna have great practice.
*  We're gonna have two great practice.
*  You show up for practice and then you see walking across the court.
*  Your medical team walk into your office.
*  If I could, if I could close and lock my door, you want to do it because you know,
*  then they're coming to say hi.
*  Yeah.
*  They're coming to give you a list.
*  All right, doc today.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Yeah.
*  Or, or, or their loads are too high.
*  And, uh, we feel like today would be another off day and I would say, well, we
*  had yesterday off, you know, and, and so a lot of that is going on.
*  So you have no practice at the NBA level.
*  You have no practice with the youth players because they're just playing games.
*  And then the other thing it's just to me, like, it's a spiritual thing.
*  The AAU just teaches people to jump around and just hop on the next best team
*  and, oh, those, and you go over there and then that's kind of who you become
*  as a, as a professional athlete, right?
*  You're just used to bouncing around from the time you're age 10.
*  And it's so much harder to have a team concept.
*  And I think it's interesting that like the guys, like the curry types are the
*  anomalies now, the curry dream on clay.
*  Like that might be the last stand for people like that.
*  But you think about all the winning teams have.
*  Yeah.
*  So, and I keep going back, the potion hasn't changed since Larry, since
*  Kuzy, the potion is still the same as what Red Allbot taught.
*  You have to play team ball.
*  You have to sacrifice.
*  You have to play together.
*  And you need continuity.
*  And you need continuity.
*  And so we don't teach that enough and we have to get back to doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're in on Houston as a, as a plan team.
*  I am.
