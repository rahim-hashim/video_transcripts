*  Coming up an absolutely incredible day for TV watching in sports. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=34.56s)]
*  It's all next. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=39.04s)]
*  We're also brought to you by the Ringer podcast network. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=39.76s)]
*  I have a new rewatchables coming for you on Monday night. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=42.4s)]
*  We did a movie from the late nineties. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  That's a very light fluffy movie that you'll probably be surprised we did. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=48.32s)]
*  But it was a request by Julian Robinson who came in to LA for a couple months [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=52.72s)]
*  and did a bunch of great stuff with us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=58.48s)]
*  So I let her pick a rewatchables. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=60.32s)]
*  And it's a good one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=63.04s)]
*  And I was excited she picked the one she picked. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what it is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=65.52s)]
*  That's coming up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=67.28s)]
*  Prestige TV is not covering The Last of Us, but we will be covering it on the House of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  R podcast and on the Midnight Boys as well on the Ring of Earth. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=72.64s)]
*  So you can check out both of those. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=75.92s)]
*  Celtic City episode seven, which basically tackles everything after Bird with the nineties, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  which was really grim. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=84.56s)]
*  And I was living in Boston for a lot of it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=85.84s)]
*  But there's no basketball tomorrow night. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=87.6s)]
*  So there's no better chance to catch up with Celtic City. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  It's on HBO 9 p.m. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=92.08s)]
*  Or you can catch up on all the episodes so far on Max. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  Coming up on this podcast, Russel and I, we recorded right after Rory McIlroy won the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=98.88s)]
*  Masters and we thought it was going to be an NBA podcast. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  But we ended up talking about golf for the first 30 minutes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=106.8s)]
*  And then we went right into Game 82, Clips Warriors, all the playoff matchups, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=108.88s)]
*  things we've noticed, some award stuff we're trying to figure out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  And it's a really good podcast. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=117.6s)]
*  First, our friends from Pearl Jam. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=119.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=142.16s)]
*  We are recording in his 430 Pacific time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=142.48s)]
*  Just watch the playoff hole of the Masters. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  We're going to talk a lot of basketball later, but that was one of the most emotional Masters [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=147.04s)]
*  of all time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  And I was trying to think, Russel, how many times have you seen a guy just pull the monkey [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  office back like that in your lifetime that you can remember? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Because we've had different versions of it, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=163.28s)]
*  Like we had LeBron in 2016, like bringing Cleveland the title. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  You have John Elway and Denver in 97. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=169.76s)]
*  There's just not a lot of those. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=173.04s)]
*  I'm kind of choked up. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=176.56s)]
*  You sound a little off, but in a good way. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=177.36s)]
*  It was an emotional thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=181.76s)]
*  I really thought not only did he blow it, it's one of those things that just hangs with you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=182.88s)]
*  for the rest of your career and becomes one of the first things mentioned. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=187.68s)]
*  That's the point where we were hitting some sort of crossroads with his career [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=190.48s)]
*  that I don't know if you can come back from. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=194.56s)]
*  And the weight of that is almost, it's worse than actually just winning the Masters and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=196.8s)]
*  getting that off, you know, because you have to live with that the rest of your life, basically. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=202.08s)]
*  Well, there was the Steve Young one, remember when he won the Super Bowl, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=207.28s)]
*  and they actually were on the sideline. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=210.16s)]
*  He was like, get the monkey off my back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=211.6s)]
*  And they were pretending they were pulling a monkey off of his back because it was the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=213.04s)]
*  post Montana thing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=216.4s)]
*  But for golf, I'm not educated enough to run through all of this until it brings back [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=218.08s)]
*  memories of Royal Troon or anything. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=223.12s)]
*  But I know that I was always frustrated with golf fans because they'd be like, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=224.56s)]
*  who do you root against? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=229.52s)]
*  You root for good golf. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=230.4s)]
*  I'm like, come on, there's going to be a couple of guys you hate. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=231.52s)]
*  And Bryson, ironically, was kind of that guy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=234.08s)]
*  He filled this villain void. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=236.88s)]
*  But then once you start to understand how golfers feel about the sport, they don't really [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=239.12s)]
*  want anyone to have that moment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=243.76s)]
*  They really don't. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=245.36s)]
*  I think we enjoy it with the NBA and NFL. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=246.8s)]
*  You're like, all right, good. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=249.68s)]
*  I'm glad this guy choked because he's just not my favorite. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=250.56s)]
*  It backs up all my arguments as we get to hard and awesome game later today. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=252.8s)]
*  But golfers just don't look at the sport that way. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=258.88s)]
*  So you're absolutely right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=261.6s)]
*  I mean, if he ends up after the shot on 17, that's going to become something of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=262.56s)]
*  master's lore and then missing a putt, which looked like it really never had a chance on 18. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not like it was the easiest part. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=271.6s)]
*  So it's not like he missed like a two or three footer and he's this choke artist. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, it was the second shot on 18 that starts it, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=276.24s)]
*  All he has to do is basically do it in the playoff hole. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=280.24s)]
*  Just get in to putt. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=282.96s)]
*  You win the Masters. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=284.24s)]
*  He's in the trap. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=285.28s)]
*  Then the hit out of the trap, just not quite close enough. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=286.8s)]
*  He's got some work left. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=290.72s)]
*  And that's golf. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=292.56s)]
*  You need a four. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=294.08s)]
*  He gets a five. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=294.72s)]
*  It seemed like Rose was hot in the betting market heading into the playoff. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=295.68s)]
*  I think Rory was still favored, which I was really surprised by because [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=300.32s)]
*  sometimes you watch those and you're like, how is this guy going to bounce back from this? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=303.84s)]
*  But he bounced back. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=308.16s)]
*  One of the great shots, I was thinking of watching him today. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=310.72s)]
*  He's like one of those basketball players that just gets hot and cold during the same game. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=313.68s)]
*  Steph's a little bit like this, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=319.28s)]
*  Steph today was one for five in that Quipper game. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=320.88s)]
*  Then all of a sudden he gets hot and he's just making everything for about eight minutes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=323.12s)]
*  And that's a little what the roller coaster rider Rory is like during these tournaments. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=326.96s)]
*  He looks amazing, amazing, amazing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=331.84s)]
*  Then all of a sudden it falls back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=333.6s)]
*  Then he comes back the other way and it's just the swings of golf. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=335.12s)]
*  But I think the one thing that's different this time around is people wanted it so badly for him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=339.04s)]
*  You could feel it when we're on the course on Tuesday and Wednesday. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=343.92s)]
*  He's clearly the most popular guy at the tournament. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=346.64s)]
*  He's taken the Tiger spot. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=350.24s)]
*  But people, when you have that, when you have the emotion of all the people with you, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=352.64s)]
*  they had that cut, did you see that cutaway when the people on 18 who were just waiting, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=357.76s)]
*  the scoreboard changed and reflected that his score had gone back, that he got in the double. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=361.76s)]
*  And people were, you know, they're holding their hands in their heads. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=367.76s)]
*  Like something like really horrible had just happened. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=371.2s)]
*  That's how badly everybody wanted it for him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=373.6s)]
*  So to come through with the pressure you have on yourself, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=375.52s)]
*  but also all of these people you don't want to let down. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=379.52s)]
*  Like I don't even know if there's a comparison to that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=382.0s)]
*  Basketball, you only have 18,000 people in the arena. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=384.88s)]
*  This is like, you know, tens and tens of thousands of people all clustered around. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=387.12s)]
*  But that's the difference with the sport. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  Like basketball doesn't really give you a chance to sit there and mope. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=393.68s)]
*  Like you kind of have to get back to it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=396.64s)]
*  I mean, most of the sports that we talk about all the time, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=398.32s)]
*  there's very little time to sit there and kind of think about what you're going through. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  And for him to double one, and then you send me a text, you go, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=403.76s)]
*  hey, we may have to lead with this if he falls apart. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=408.8s)]
*  And it's almost this anticipation that he's going to fall apart [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=411.36s)]
*  because he's played so well the first three rounds. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=414.24s)]
*  And then I look it up and like, oh, but then he's like four under the next 10 holes. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=416.48s)]
*  So I think it's kind of the sport and even him, you know, going into the bunker, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=420.08s)]
*  which you're right is the bigger part of him missing the putt on 18, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=424.64s)]
*  is that he actually kind of cracked a smile. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=428.24s)]
*  He almost laughed at himself. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=432.32s)]
*  Like you're going to be fucking kidding me. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=433.92s)]
*  So that there was some emotion that he was showing I thought was a better sign. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=436.16s)]
*  And I also think it helps probably playing 18 again all over to start the playoff, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=440.32s)]
*  knowing like, okay, in my second shot, like I can't do that again. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=444.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=448.16s)]
*  So I also think a lot of people in attendance too, based on, you know, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=448.8s)]
*  what we're talking about, just the patrons, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=452.8s)]
*  And their minds that have just wanted great things to happen and not terrible things to happen. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=455.12s)]
*  It's a very positive group. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=458.8s)]
*  There's also something too, which it's not, I shouldn't say selfish, but they want to see [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=459.84s)]
*  him complete the slam. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=465.84s)]
*  So now he's got to ever do it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=466.88s)]
*  You get to say that you were there in 25 at Augusta to see this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=468.64s)]
*  This is one of those, it's not Tiger's win, but it's one of the more memorable ones because [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  he completes this career Odyssey. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=475.84s)]
*  Because if you think about the start of his career, it was like, oh my God, like what, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=477.44s)]
*  what can't this guy do? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to talk about like, is he going to win 10 majors or something like that? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=482.64s)]
*  I remember when I was in college, I was in the first year of college. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=486.08s)]
*  One of the debate shows at ESPN, like after he got married, it was like, well, he is married. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=489.68s)]
*  It's like, so he's the only pro athlete who's married and this is why he's playing bad. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=493.2s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, like, I understand, I understand time constraints can change as [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=496.24s)]
*  the non-married guy. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=499.6s)]
*  Like I'm aware that your schedule is a little tighter, but it just, it drove me crazy because [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=500.32s)]
*  he wasn't playing as well. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=505.44s)]
*  Then there had to be a reason. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=506.64s)]
*  It was like the only thing that anybody could point to. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=507.6s)]
*  But he's never really been somebody that, I mean, his, his game itself is so enjoyable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=510.0s)]
*  I think he had a shot yesterday where I was watching. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=515.12s)]
*  He's like 209 out hits a six iron and he smokes it into the air too. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=518.8s)]
*  He throws it like a dart and you're like, how did you get it that far at that angle? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=523.12s)]
*  So he's also probably as much fun as everybody or anyone on the, on the tour on top of everybody [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=527.68s)]
*  rooting for somebody him for like, like him to complete this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=538.08s)]
*  There's a fearlessness to him with some of the shots he hits. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=538.24s)]
*  He had a couple today where he's in front of trees and you know, branches, all kinds of things. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=540.8s)]
*  You're like, wait, is he going for this? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=546.8s)]
*  Well, there's the tower shot. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=548.32s)]
*  There's the one on the left side on the drive where he gets a decent enough bounce. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=550.1600000000001s)]
*  And then you're like, he's going to go through that or over it or what, you know, it's like the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=553.44s)]
*  guy that never gives in to just go, let me save the hole. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  He's constantly thinking like, what's the best score can I get on? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  He plays the game the way no one should ever play it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=563.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=566.72s)]
*  We did a thing on my pod this week about the people that the gallery responded to the most [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=567.44s)]
*  because tiger is basically done and there was two different tournaments when tiger played. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=571.5200000000001s)]
*  It was basically the tiger tournament was happening and the gallery is just following him. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=575.12s)]
*  And then everybody else is playing now tiger's gone and Rory had become the guy, but Bryson was [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=578.8s)]
*  kind of, you know, gaining on it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=584.4s)]
*  And you could feel like those two had separated themselves from everybody else who put who was [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  at the masters basically with the fans, with the reactions, with the interest, everything. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=591.36s)]
*  So then the fact that they're teamed up head to head for this last one, he double bogeys the first [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=595.44s)]
*  hole. And it just seemed like Bryson was going to run over him like a freight train. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=600.4s)]
*  The opposite happens. Then it seems like he has it. Then all of a sudden he doesn't. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=605.12s)]
*  Then Rose makes that crazy putt on 18, right? As like, you know, we're already starting to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=609.36s)]
*  maybe waiver a tiny bit, but it's. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  I can't, I, the, the five masters that probably remember the most. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  And I don't remember golf the same way. I remember basketball where I can tell you like every single [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=622.88s)]
*  finals and all in the Western finals this happened, but the masters is the one that, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=627.12s)]
*  you know, I've cared about the most my whole life. 86 Nicklaus, the Faldo Norman masters, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=631.04s)]
*  the, uh, the tiger in 2019. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=637.68s)]
*  And then this one, I think we're at least four of the best. I'm sure there there's a bunch of [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=641.84s)]
*  others, but those are the four that the Faldo Norman master, I don't remember anybody [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=646.24s)]
*  not talking about that for like four days after that just felt like this life altering [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=651.52s)]
*  just never seen an athlete fall apart like that. Have you? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  It's an all time example of an athlete just completely falling apart. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  It might be the only time I watched golf and care during college like that round. Right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  Right. I mean, sports are hard to find a way to, to fit into the, we didn't have cable, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=670.6400000000001s)]
*  I think in our house for like two or three years to on top of everything else. So it's like, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  all right, network TV, even have a ton of options. I just remember not being super dialed into 160 [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=678.48s)]
*  Red Sox games during college. And I just remember that afternoon, you know, it's a, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=682.88s)]
*  it's a hungover, whatever it's kind of a, is it muddy out or sunny out in Vermont? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=687.92s)]
*  And then you realize like that really is one of those results. You'll never forget where you were [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=693.12s)]
*  and the Faldo hugging him at the end. I don't ever remember anything like that either. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=697.12s)]
*  Faldo felt worse about winning than probably anybody who's ever won a golf tournament. But [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=701.36s)]
*  you know, God, we were talking about it. We were in there. You've team sports, you have a sport, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=707.68s)]
*  like the Clippers, where's game that we're going to talk about, you know, a little bit later and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=711.92s)]
*  guys can affect the games. Draymond has that terrible put where he just should have gone up [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=716.16s)]
*  with it. He's trying to draw a foul and he screwed that play up. It's not the entire reason they lost. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  That's the thing you would think too. Golf, you're just by yourself. There's nobody else. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=724.88s)]
*  There's no other reason you're going to win or lose. It's all you. You can't blame anybody. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=729.36s)]
*  You're there with, with your thoughts. You're there with the momentum of it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=733.68s)]
*  You're there with all of a sudden, I just don't feel great about this drive, but I have to hit [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=737.28s)]
*  it anyway. All these little moments that you're just battling. We were saying it's the only sport [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=744.0s)]
*  where you have to be like insanely competitive, but also completely calm. Is there any other sport [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=748.4s)]
*  like that? You, like you have two emotions that are direct. I was talking to my wife about this [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=755.12s)]
*  yesterday because I was explaining her the whole Roy thing. And I was like, here's the sport where [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=760.0s)]
*  you just have these two things that don't make sense together. I have to be like a driven [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=764.0s)]
*  competitive maniac, but I also have to be completely calm at the worst possible moments of whatever [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=768.56s)]
*  I'm competing in or the scariest or the hairiest, whatever you want to say. And that's why there's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=774.72s)]
*  so few great golfers. You can't juggle that, you know? No, it's really great way of putting it [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=779.44s)]
*  because I remember when the Sloan paper came out about there's no such thing as clutch. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=785.36s)]
*  And I thought, okay, you know, there's all sorts of great basketball players. Like if we want to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=791.2s)]
*  just shave it down to down one score tied, takes the shot. And then you look at the field goal [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=796.8000000000001s)]
*  makes versus field goal attempts. Like your favorite players have awful stats on those. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=804.24s)]
*  Like there's all sorts of guys you can go through and be like, this guy's a killer. And then you're [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=809.44s)]
*  like, he's two for 30 in these situations. And then if people hate one of those guys, they'll put [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  that up. And it's like, okay. I mean, it feels a little like politics would be like, what's your [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=818.72s)]
*  guy doing? You know, what's your guy shooting in that situation, which completely eliminates [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=822.24s)]
*  like the shot down three with 58 seconds left to go that ties it. It's like, that's a really [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=827.2s)]
*  clutch shot that matters, but it gets lost in the filtering with a lot of the stuff. Right? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=833.12s)]
*  So when that paper came out, it wasn't like, I didn't do a nerds thing. You know, like some [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=837.28s)]
*  of the Sloan papers that had come out early on, where it talked about like the ways to block shots [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=843.44s)]
*  because it wasn't always gaining the possession. But I just felt like, okay, if there's math that [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=847.6s)]
*  can't prove that this thing is true, can't we prove it in another way? And that there are people- [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't mean it's not true. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=859.76s)]
*  Right. Doesn't it, like, do we believe that there are people that are really tight in big spots? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=860.96s)]
*  And the sport of golf, like probably that shows up more than any other sport. You know, I don't know [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=866.88s)]
*  if it's somebody throwing an interception. I don't know if it's, maybe it's missing a free throw is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=872.96s)]
*  the closest thing we have to a putt in the other sports. Maybe it's an error, but you know, again, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=876.08s)]
*  that's not going to happen. You're not going to have enough chances or the math would make any [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=881.2s)]
*  sense. So if we sit here and we agree that there are people that can choke, that are just not [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  comfortable, then we should be able to figure out a way. Maybe there isn't math that backs it up, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=890.0s)]
*  but there are people that are just a little bit more comfortable coming back from that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=895.2s)]
*  And golf presents like this reset where you open with a double for Rory and it's like, here we go. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=898.72s)]
*  And everybody sitting around watching just knows what would happen to them. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=905.12s)]
*  Like, it's just going to fall apart. It's like, well, again, this is why these guys are the best [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  in the world. There's nothing in the other sports. Like, I don't watch a receiver get open going. I [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=912.64s)]
*  can do that. I don't watch somebody get a shot off in basketball thinking, oh, that, you know, I would [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=917.04s)]
*  like, we just, we've accepted the gap, but with golf, because there are moments where even the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=921.84s)]
*  worst golfer can have like this great shot and everybody like kids around or your friends are [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=927.28s)]
*  asking you like, what would you do on 18 right now? There's that disconnect where I don't know [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=931.12s)]
*  that we appreciate the mental reset hole, the hole that these guys have to do to keep themselves [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=937.68s)]
*  in it. And then ultimately win a major. It's the biggest disconnect between fans and the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=944.16s)]
*  people covering whatever sport you're going to pick and the people who actually do it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=949.28s)]
*  Like even, did you see UFC last night? I didn't. So Lopez who ends up losing and he just seemed tight [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=952.72s)]
*  in the first, in the first couple of rounds against Vogue. And then as the, as it went along [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=960.16s)]
*  in the last couple of rounds, he kind of became who he was. And it's like, even stuff like that, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=966.4s)]
*  you think, yeah, I can see it. I can see why you get tight. Like what, like, what was the most nervous [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=970.4s)]
*  you've ever been professionally doing anything? Not to compare us to athletes, but it's just an [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=976.0s)]
*  interesting side track. I look, I probably the first time I ever called a baseball game. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=981.52s)]
*  Because it was the first time I was ever on the air. You know, the nervousness went away [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=990.16s)]
*  pretty quickly. I was definitely a little like tuned up to host them, but. Well, how about when, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=994.48s)]
*  when you were actually like established professionally, but there was still a moment [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  where you had nerves. The only thing I can think of is, is anchoring when I had to anchor because [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  it wasn't something, it wasn't something it was, everybody told me I couldn't do it. So I was like, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1011.12s)]
*  all right. You know, what were you anchoring? The combine. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Cause then I [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1014.8s)]
*  actually had to like pay attention to all the cues and the directors and all this stuff. I, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1020.4s)]
*  we're pretty close to being called absolute losers for comparing anchoring the combine [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1023.68s)]
*  to winning the masters. But I, I'm just talking about when you feel something that you feel like [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1027.6s)]
*  you can do, but then your heart starts pounding and the pressure comes in. Cause it could be [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1032.56s)]
*  anything. Right. I remember the first time I hosted PTI, like 10 minutes before and you kind [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1038.32s)]
*  of sit down, you're getting in and they hook you in. And I was just like, I'm fucking terrified. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1046.8s)]
*  I'm like, literally I'm terrified. And I wonder like in sports, you're not going to be like that [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1051.12s)]
*  because it's repetition and you've done so many things, but I'm sure there's moments [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1056.24s)]
*  where you're like, I'm good. I've done this a million kajillion times, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1060.6399999999999s)]
*  but I'm still kind of terrified. And golf has to be the number one for that. I think tennis is a [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1064.64s)]
*  good one where it's like, Oh, I got to get this servant. I'm down 30, 40. I've got to get this [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1068.96s)]
*  first servant. And that's just a different, once you start thinking about it, it's different [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1074.64s)]
*  basketball. Like I remember the scariest free throws. I've talked about this scary, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1078.5600000000002s)]
*  scariest free throws I ever saw were the Ray Allen shot game when it looked like the game was over. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1082.5600000000002s)]
*  And then Miami hit the three and they filed Kawhi and they were, San Antonio was up two and they [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1091.2s)]
*  came to our side where our set was. And the crowd was just so loud and things were shaking. And [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  Kawhi was like, what 22. He had to make these two free throws basically to clinch the game. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  And I was just watching going, this seems too hard. I don't know how he's going to make this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1108.16s)]
*  And he missed the first one. He made the second. But when you're, when you're in the vicinity of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1112.24s)]
*  something like that and you can actually feel the pressure and you're just a bystander, it's, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1117.84s)]
*  it's, it's unreal. I've been lucky enough to been to a lot of different games and events where you've [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1121.6799999999998s)]
*  had that feeling. And it's just, there's no way you can't feel it. Even if you're a player, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  like even like Clippers rockets, when the Clippers collapsed in 2015, like you could feel that in the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1131.12s)]
*  arena, you could feel the energy shifting. So I'm sure you feel it in golf too, not to mention the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1137.28s)]
*  nerves. The benefit of all these other sports that we're talking about for the most part, I mean, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1142.56s)]
*  not so much baseball, but you know, basketball, I think once you're out there and the physical [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1146.72s)]
*  part of the game takes over, you know, it's, it just, it's kind of a wake up. Like even if you're [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1152.24s)]
*  nervous, like it's those moments where you have time to think in football, like most people will [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1158.72s)]
*  tell you, they don't really feel like they're ready to go until they get absolutely blasted. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1163.2s)]
*  And then once they get blasted, it's like, okay, you know, let's, let's, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1166.5600000000002s)]
*  yeah, banging bodies probably helps with the nervous energy a little bit with golf to sit there [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1169.44s)]
*  and to think. And you have the guy in front of their group screwing up. So everybody's kind of [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1174.56s)]
*  delayed on 18. So now you have even more time to think, but Rory's great off the tee, you know, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1180.16s)]
*  it's, it's that second shot that we would have thought about a lot differently and would have [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1185.92s)]
*  remembered forever. Now we'll just forget it within a week, which is great, which is, which is good [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1190.24s)]
*  for Rory. But yeah, they're just, there's probably, you know, you always wonder like there's, there's [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1195.2s)]
*  like, it's not the G league guy, but if you ask NBA players, but like, Hey, was there somebody that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1199.44s)]
*  you grew up with or somebody who played and be like, you know, this guy was nasty. Like he just [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1203.84s)]
*  gave it to us all the time. And you're like, Oh, what happened to him? Like, Oh, coach fucked him [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1208.1599999999999s)]
*  transfer and all these different things. You just wonder how many great golfers there are that can't [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  handle any of this stuff. Like if no one's around and they're just playing another guy, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1216.56s)]
*  they're just as good as them. But once they're on this kind of platform or, you know, at this, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1222.32s)]
*  this level, I just imagine it's a massive separator that we don't even think about [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1229.68s)]
*  compared to the physical skills of these guys. Well, my buddy, Nathan Hubbard, who cohost the [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
*  fairway rolling podcast with, with house and his brothers on the tour, Mark, and he's talked about [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1238.64s)]
*  this on the podcast. So I'm not talking about a school Mark, Mark got to like 63 one year, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1242.88s)]
*  right? He was really close and Nathan's dream as his brother is for him to crack and crack it and [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1248.24s)]
*  make the masters and have his brother be at the masters. That's like the dream. And he's come close [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1255.2s)]
*  and it's what you're talking about. He's, he's got 95% of it and he can't just put together the four [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1260.32s)]
*  straight days in a row or the nine holes when he really needs it in a big tournament or whatever, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1266.8s)]
*  the one thing you need to get in the top 10 to get some exemption. And it's always like, it's always [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1271.68s)]
*  like one shot, one hole where it can't happen. And there's probably like dozens of guys like him, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1277.44s)]
*  right? They're almost there. And it's just like, you know, I even look at the NBA, we, we, some of [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1281.76s)]
*  the guys that we talk about that we like watching and you think like, is Kim Whitmore sitting on the [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1288.24s)]
*  Rockets bench going, if I just got playing time, I would, I could potentially be an all star. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1294.72s)]
*  There's gotta be like 50 guys in the league right that, right? Tari Isen's like, I'm a second team [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1299.28s)]
*  all defense guy. I just don't get enough minutes. So yeah, it's a razor thin margin. I think the one [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1304.08s)]
*  thing with Rory and I just think in general authenticity is making a big kind of comeback [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1309.92s)]
*  push in the mid 2020s. And we've had, we had this whole era with sports with the guys being told to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1316.48s)]
*  fall down when they went to tennis tournament and you know, every, you could see way cut to the coach [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1322.88s)]
*  waving for, what was it? Agassi go down, go down after he won. And people trying to manipulate [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1328.16s)]
*  certain moments and watching Rory just collapse and just be that overcome by winning. That to me [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1334.8s)]
*  was the most authentic thing we're probably going to see this year, I would guess. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1342.08s)]
*  Yeah. And you look, I give Rory a lot of credit for that because [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1347.68s)]
*  you know, there's just, everything's covered, right? And this has been for a long time. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1352.24s)]
*  And so, you know, there's certain athletes like I'll just use LeBron, for example, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1356.3999999999999s)]
*  like I don't know how you could be famous this long and have everybody like you. Like we could [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1361.2s)]
*  get into some of the criticism of the personality, like overall, I mean, come on, it's not, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1365.04s)]
*  it's not that, you know, like nobody thinks he's a dick. Yeah, 23 years. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1369.12s)]
*  But he comes up as a, as what, junior high age awareness and then cover sports illustrated [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1374.1599999999999s)]
*  mid teens and the whole thing. And you can see with certain guys that they become famous. So now I'm [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1381.84s)]
*  not just on LeBron. I'm talking generally here is it's kind of like the high school kid. You see [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1387.68s)]
*  like an interview on some recruiting site and he's like, I'm all about winning. All I care about is [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1393.92s)]
*  winning. I think it might be. And it's like, you don't, you don't even care about it. You probably [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1397.92s)]
*  don't like maybe some of you might, but you've all watched what is the highest approval response [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1402.64s)]
*  or explanation of yourself. So it, a lot of it feels disingenuous. You're pandering to whatever [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1410.72s)]
*  you think people want to hear you say. You know what you're supposed to say, you know, you're [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1416.48s)]
*  younger. You haven't really formed a ton of your own opinions on things. I mean, it's kind of [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1420.4s)]
*  impossible without more life experience to begin with. So, so it feels like so much of what we've [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1423.44s)]
*  seen over the last few years is rehearsed. And I'm not sure that I entirely blame athletes, especially [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1427.84s)]
*  a younger generation kind of coming up this way, feeling like there's no escape from any of it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1434.32s)]
*  Like I'm constantly, everything I do is consumed in some way. So yeah, I may play it safe or, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1438.4s)]
*  I guess it's, it's kind of like the Russell Wilson thing where I know exactly once he does the post [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1445.36s)]
*  game, he's going to think the offensive line he's going to, he's going out of his way to go over [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1449.1999999999998s)]
*  this mental checkbox to just make it seem like he is the most team first dude that you've ever come [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1453.6799999999998s)]
*  across your entire life. But then you lose that connection because you already know what's coming. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1459.6s)]
*  You've heard the same shit for years and years and years. So there's got to be some kind of piece, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1463.04s)]
*  especially for somebody like Rory later on, or any of these other guys that get a little bit older [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  and you just feel totally comfortable. And it's great if your default is also like a likable [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1472.72s)]
*  personality on top of everything else. Well, it's one of the reasons I think you and I have [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  gravitated to Edwards, Anthony Edwards in, in basketball, cause he's just authentic all the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  time. Almost sometimes to his detriment. Did you see what happened the other night with him? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1488.88s)]
*  Tell me. The crowd was chanting child support when he was at the free throw line and he started [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1494.32s)]
*  laughing. Oh my God. What crowd was that? It was two nights ago, I think. Oh, they, uh, yeah. One of [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1499.6s)]
*  the latter. Oh my God. I'm not, I'm not like suggesting I'm, I'm, you know, but he knows, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1508.0s)]
*  he knows he's going to take shit for certain things and he's pretty open about it. And he'll [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1517.76s)]
*  talk about it. Yeah, that's one. Um, well, we'll see when he plays the Lakers. Yeah. But the, uh, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1521.52s)]
*  now that Rory has this off his back, I don't, I don't know who the next guy is. I guess it's [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1527.92s)]
*  it's almost best rounds at the masters last year. Well, I was, I was going to say, uh, Lamar, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1533.76s)]
*  Josh Allen, maybe James Harden. I'm trying to think of guys in different sports who monkey on [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1539.92s)]
*  the back guys. Um, Lamar's not old enough yet. Like Rory, we have some, we had some, some real [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1545.6000000000001s)]
*  years here and then we had us open last year and we've had some suffering and, and time spent [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1552.48s)]
*  invested in him getting over the hump for forever. So it almost has to be Lamar's almost too young. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1558.48s)]
*  We don't have enough losses yet. Josh Allen's too young. Like Harden would be an interesting one. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1564.56s)]
*  Because I think there'd have to be Harden with four straight routes. Yeah. Cause I don't think [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1570.56s)]
*  Allen's had bad playoff games. I think Lamar has had worse playoff games, but I think we all feel [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1576.96s)]
*  better about him as a quarterback now. Uh, Harden has a long resume of this stuff and I'll, I'll [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1583.28s)]
*  admit as I was watching today, I mean, I know we're going to get into this game, but he was so good. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1589.92s)]
*  And I've even joked, I think there probably been a couple of seasons going into it. I was like, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1593.76s)]
*  you think he's just be due to have kind of a baseline. Like I need your floor to be higher [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1599.04s)]
*  than some of those just disastrous floor games from him. That might be the pick because it would [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1604.16s)]
*  have to be. There's some guys, there's some guys that I think of like, look, I just think there's [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1609.68s)]
*  different ways to talk about different players and their failures and their successes. And sometimes [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1616.0s)]
*  we just want to label everyone that's failed a failure and it's all for the exact same reasons. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1619.76s)]
*  And it's like, okay, well sometimes Josh Allen's going up against Patrick Mahomes, you know? So [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1623.36s)]
*  like, are we going to shit on Josh Allen for it? I mean, I guess you will, if you want to do that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1627.2s)]
*  on TV, cause I've seen it, but it has to be some of your own undoing as well. And Rory's had that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1631.04s)]
*  So I think Harden's like, if we want to spend more time on it, I mean, and Bede's probably not [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1639.68s)]
*  at top of mind right now, cause he's been hurt, but he's probably in the, but it's just not as long. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1644.48s)]
*  Well, but here's a good example. Harden's made the playoffs every year. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1648.48s)]
*  Ray Boric is a good example. Cause anything that happened to him was not by his doing. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1651.84s)]
*  He was fucking awesome on the Bruins. I loved the Bruins back then. And it really came down [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1656.6399999999999s)]
*  to they were always like a third line center, two short or, you know, one defenseman short. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1660.56s)]
*  They never spent quite enough money around him, but he was awesome and nobody ever blamed Ray [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1666.08s)]
*  Boric. So then when he finally went to Colorado and he won, and I was living in Boston back then, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1670.56s)]
*  I think you were too, everyone went to bars to root for Colorado so that Ray Boric could finally [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1675.52s)]
*  get one. Cause we love Ray Boric. We wanted him to get one that he didn't have the kind of tragedy [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1682.56s)]
*  and the ups and downs of somebody like Rory. So I don't know. I don't know who it is. Rory was [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1688.56s)]
*  clearly the most popular. It could be Alcares. Well, Alcares has already won. I don't know. I [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1693.2s)]
*  don't know who it is. I was, I was still in Vermont and I remember because he was traded [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1698.32s)]
*  and he was teammates with one of my friends and he told this awesome Ray Boric story, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1703.2s)]
*  which is pretty minor. So I'm not going to build it up too much, but it's too late. But [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1708.1599999999999s)]
*  like he had, he was on the team. It's Ray fucking Boric, you know, one of the guys, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1712.0s)]
*  one of the younger guys was like, Ray, can I get your cell or do you get a number? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1715.92s)]
*  And he was like, why? So you and your buddies can call me drunk in the middle of the night. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1720.16s)]
*  That was his answer. But he knew he was like, it was in a funny way. It wasn't being a jerk about it. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1725.1200000000001s)]
*  That's great. Cause you know, they, he knew based on the way the guy was asking him, it was like, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1732.3200000000002s)]
*  it was still this hockey God in the locker room with him being like, Hey man, you know, like, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1739.2800000000002s)]
*  maybe I'll get your number or something. And then he just, he shot it down. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1746.72s)]
*  Ray Boric was in one of the great authentic Boston sports moments ever when he gave the jersey to [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1750.64s)]
*  ESPO, when they were retiring Esposito's Jersey and Ray Boric was wearing number seven because [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1755.2s)]
*  they traded Esposito to the Rangers and they, there was a little bit of bad blood. So then Boric came [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1761.6000000000001s)]
*  in and he was the rookie and he was awesome. And then at some point in the eighties, they had [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1766.48s)]
*  Espo night and Boric came in and took the, took the, his Jersey off and he had the 77 underneath [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1770.56s)]
*  and he just gave Espo his Jersey. It's fucking amazing. Amazing sports moment. You ever interview [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1777.28s)]
*  Esposito? No, I've always heard he was kind of, kind of, kind of lit. It was letting it fly. Yeah. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1783.28s)]
*  You had him on the radio show. Yeah. Back in the early days. I mean, we were thrilled. We're like, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1790.96s)]
*  man, we get Esposito for eight minutes. This fucking week is made. It's like a crazy Italian guy. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1794.48s)]
*  But just the second he's on the air with you, it's just on. Yeah. He was great. Let's take a break. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1799.68s)]
*  And then we have a lot of basketball to hit because today, nothing, the little Simmons [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1805.2s)]
*  masters moment, fresh Augusta, you know, you got anything for us? Well, I'll tell you this on, on [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1809.28s)]
*  Wednesday, I split up with the group I was with and I was with Nathan and I think [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1815.84s)]
*  Chang and we just ended up on the fifth pole watching them putt and it was Rory. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1820.56s)]
*  It was Lowry. It was John Rom and it was Fleetwood. And in the practice round, you can kind of like, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1826.8s)]
*  you just fucking around. You can basically hit with whoever. I think they let them decide a little [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1833.28s)]
*  bit. So the four of them were playing, they were all gambling and they were clear. They were buddies. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1837.36s)]
*  And we were right there when they were all teeing off on the sixth hole and we felt like Lowry and [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1841.52s)]
*  Rory were betting. So we were all excited. Like, Oh, I wonder what they're betting. Like getting [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1845.28s)]
*  there, kind of keeping track and just, they seem loose. And it was one of the reasons I picked [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1849.52s)]
*  Rory to win because I was like, Roy seems loose. He's like betting with Lowry. This seems good. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1853.52s)]
*  Fast forward to when he wins today. Lowry was one of the guys waiting for him. Like almost like he [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1859.04s)]
*  was a family member. I don't know if you saw that. Rory comes off the course and he's hugging [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  different things. He sees Lowry like huge long hug and like high fives and then Fleetwood, same [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1867.92s)]
*  thing. And I was like, Oh, those must be like, that's like his Ryder Cup crew. You know, all his [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1873.6s)]
*  dudes. But anyway, it's just, it stuck out because we had that moment on Wednesday. We were like, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1879.1999999999998s)]
*  wow, Roy seems loose. This is a good sign because coming off last, last summer, who knows? All right, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1882.7199999999998s)]
*  we're gonna take a break. We'll talk, we'll talk a little Warriors clips and some playoffs and some [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1889.9199999999998s)]
*  all NBA. All right. Game of the day, game 82, which I think was a lot more fun last year. This year, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1895.28s)]
*  we knew a lot of the matchups and the records, but we did have this incredible Clippers Warriors [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1901.52s)]
*  game that it's, it's tough. Every time there's a great game, you want to do the game of the year. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1905.76s)]
*  But I think that actually might've been the game of the year because they were real stakes and both [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1912.4s)]
*  teams really wanted it. And I think both teams wanted the rest. I don't even think it was about [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1916.4s)]
*  the matchups as much as can we get five, six days off here? The Warriors definitely wanted it because [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1920.24s)]
*  they have an older team and the Clippers are playing this, you know, they're the, they have [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1925.84s)]
*  Kawaii Jenga and the game, the game was fascinating for a whole bunch of different reasons. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1930.32s)]
*  The Clippers win. And I'm going to start here because I felt that way before the game. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1936.24s)]
*  I think the Clippers are the second best team in the West. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1940.72s)]
*  Okay. Counter any counter. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1946.0s)]
*  Well, the only thing that I would counter is just all the stuff that all of us would say about, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1951.84s)]
*  okay, well in the playoffs, like, are they a riskier bet than these other teams? But as far as who [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1955.6s)]
*  is playing the best basketball right now, they're the second best team in the West. So I'm not going [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1959.44s)]
*  to argue with you. Yeah. Last 15 going into today, number one offense, number one defense. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1963.3600000000001s)]
*  The Kawaii thing is real. March, April, he's playing 36 minutes a game. He's shooting it like crazy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1968.96s)]
*  Zou is one of the most underrated players in the NBA. And on top of everything else, like you can [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1975.28s)]
*  just see the difference against some of these teams that may want to go small because I still [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1979.92s)]
*  think there's like three or four teams that would prefer to go small. Okay. So you can do whatever [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1983.52s)]
*  they want. Houston actually wants to play big. Golden State definitely wants to play small. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1988.0s)]
*  The Lakers definitely want to play small. And so now that you have this first round matchup, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1991.92s)]
*  four or five, like, so it's not like they're going to be, you know, I don't know. I mean, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=1996.24s)]
*  some weird stuff would have to happen. And again, looking at the seating and all things. So it's [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2000.32s)]
*  not like they're just going to run through all these small teams. But if you want to go small [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2003.2s)]
*  against the Clippers, it's going to be a big problem because Zou is such a huge part of their [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2007.12s)]
*  offense. They trust him more and he just beats the hell out of you. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2011.52s)]
*  What's, what's, what's talk Zou because I think it ties into a bigger thing with the Clippers. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2016.72s)]
*  I think he's going to be on the 13th All-MBA for me and I'll make the case for it later. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2023.04s)]
*  But I can't believe, and I've been watching him really carefully the last month because it was [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2029.28s)]
*  jumping out at me during games. Started looking at the stats, started talking to some people, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2034.0s)]
*  um, asking like, am I crazy or is Zou bots like incredibly important in this team? And is he kind [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2039.28s)]
*  of better than people realize you watch the game today. He was awesome in that game. I mean, I, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2044.32s)]
*  I don't know how many times he defended the rim against somebody and either thwarted or drive or [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2050.96s)]
*  changed somebody's direction on a drive, but it was between 15 and 20, not to mention the alley [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2055.84s)]
*  hoop stuff, not to mention the rebounds. And he plays plays big minutes every game. And I think [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2060.72s)]
*  he's played 79 games this year. He's like 32, 33 minutes a game and he hasn't gotten foul trouble. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2067.44s)]
*  So like the thing I was thinking with all NBA was I've had Jaren Jackson in there all year [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2072.64s)]
*  and I just watching Zou bots going, this guy plays all the time. He stays on the court. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2078.16s)]
*  He's gotten better as the year goes along. And to me, like the guy that he really reminds me of is [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2082.8s)]
*  Gasol on the Grizzlies that 2013, 14, 15 era Gasol. He's not the pastor Gasol was, but his big, how [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2088.16s)]
*  he's always in the right positions with his hands up players and the other team are always afraid of [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2096.8s)]
*  him protecting the rim. He grabs, he's a better rebounder than Gasol was. And if you watch what [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2101.28s)]
*  the Warriors today, when they were, when they were posting up Zou bots, the Warriors were reacting [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2106.5600000000004s)]
*  and sending a double every time. And the Quippers, when they need baskets, sometimes they run stuff [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2110.96s)]
*  through him. So to set up the other guys, I just think, I think he's the third best center in [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2115.04s)]
*  basketball right now behind towns and Yokech. Obviously Yokech is number one, but I think he's [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2120.0800000000004s)]
*  third. I really do. Well, if you want to run your offense through him, you can, you can trust him [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2124.4s)]
*  now to catch depending on where you want to set them up because, you know, we saw, I mean, there's [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2130.56s)]
*  a few different things, obviously that happened in the length of an overtime game, but early on [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2134.88s)]
*  it's like, let's make sure we get some touches and let's see how Golden State wants to defend this. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  And so if you double him, he'll get it right out and he can swing it. So you can trust him to do [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2142.64s)]
*  that. If you let him get deeper off of a drive, like Harden plays it brilliantly. I mean, the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2146.96s)]
*  best thing Harden's ever done his entire career, I think is off that high ball screen. And then you [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2151.36s)]
*  have the, you have almost basically the big shadowing you, but with Zou, he doesn't even need to [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2156.48s)]
*  necessarily roll off the high screen. He can be just in the dunker spot. And then that guy comes [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2161.76s)]
*  over to help on the Harden drive because Harden's just so good on that kind of stuff. And then Harden [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2166.4s)]
*  finds these passing lanes. That wraparound that he made going to his left side with his left hand, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2170.0s)]
*  where it looked like the angle was completely shut off is great. And if you run through the numbers, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2174.08s)]
*  Golden State was forcing turnovers, really good on ball defense. They got up 36-25, 10-52, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2178.48s)]
*  the second quarter, they bring Zou back in and they close the half 35-22. There's all sorts of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2184.16s)]
*  numbers that just point to his impact. And then if you look at the best- [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2188.56s)]
*  No, it's got to the point where they, you almost feel like they have to hold on when he's out. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2191.44s)]
*  That's how I felt in the fourth quarter. You have these Ben Simmons minutes and you're like, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2195.6s)]
*  they just got to make sure they don't fall down eight before Zou Bach comes in. Like that's how [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2199.12s)]
*  important he's become for them. And all the Clipper fans, that's all they talk about. They [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2202.88s)]
*  think he's like the most underrated guy in the league. They're like Scientologists about it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2206.32s)]
*  I agree with them. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2209.6800000000003s)]
*  But there was this Ben Simmons stretch. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2213.52s)]
*  If you could come speak, Bill, at our Zou Bach thing. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2215.76s)]
*  Is there a Zou Bach festival? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2219.36s)]
*  We have a medal for you. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2221.1200000000003s)]
*  There was a Ben Simmons stretch where the Warriors were like, you know what, fuck this, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2222.32s)]
*  we're going zone. Ben Simmons, knock yourself out at the foul line, try to make some plays. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2226.32s)]
*  And it was, it was brutal, like legit brutal. And then he finally made one pass and got an assist. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2231.68s)]
*  But I don't know if that's sustainable for them in the playoffs, any Ben Simmons minutes. Now, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2237.2s)]
*  they didn't have Batum today and I think Batum is really important for them. And actually they can, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2241.9199999999996s)]
*  as crazy as it sounds against the right team, even go super small with them and maybe not [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2247.04s)]
*  play Ben Simmons at all. But I just think the way Kawhi's playing, you mentioned that, was he 24 [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2251.7599999999998s)]
*  and seven since the All-Star break and getting shots, getting to his spots defensively, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2258.48s)]
*  he's starting to look not a hundred percent like San Antonio Kawhi, but he's like, you know, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2263.44s)]
*  it's, it's reminiscent. He could turn it on. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2269.04s)]
*  I don't know that it's ever going to be that again. So you're being totally fair about that [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2271.52s)]
*  because you're just talking about a level of intensity. Maybe they didn't even want him to [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2274.72s)]
*  play that intensely, but you're right on the Simmons thing. I'm glad you brought up a tomb, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2279.68s)]
*  not being available. Cause I was thinking the exact same thing. They go zone. It was kind of [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2282.48s)]
*  working except they weren't corral on the basketball. So they're giving up offensive [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2286.4s)]
*  rebounds, which is one of the problems of the zone anyway, especially if you're small and Simmons [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2289.6s)]
*  just doesn't really, I don't, I mean, this isn't breaking news, but it's not playable when he has [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2294.32s)]
*  to think about what he's doing. It's over. So he was good enough on tapping a couple of balls out. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2300.56s)]
*  He did have that one assist, but he had two other passes on the right side where he tried to throw [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2306.8s)]
*  like a no look at one point and you're just going like, what, what are you doing right now? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2311.92s)]
*  But you're, that's fouling them intentionally either. Cause that's the other piece you can do [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2317.28s)]
*  in the playoffs. Just try and take them out. Maybe teams wouldn't want to do that because they want [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2321.36s)]
*  them to stay on the court to have seen it that way. Cause I felt the same way. It's like the [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2324.64s)]
*  Clippers have to survive these non-Zubach minutes, especially because Simmons is in there and the [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2327.92s)]
*  more possessions they probably roll with Simmons, the more it's just guys screaming from the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2332.8s)]
*  Golden State bench. Like don't even worry about it. Like if he sets a screen too, with the ball, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2336.72s)]
*  he cuts through, don't worry about it. Like if he's not going to catch it in the post and then turn [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2341.6s)]
*  around and work us in a mismatch or something, we'll be fine. It's just, they really struggled [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  to rebound during that stretch. It's like that Pats, the second Pats giant Superbowl when Chad, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2351.4399999999996s)]
*  Chad Ocho-Sinko was the second receiver for the Pats. And I was at the game and you could see the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2357.2799999999997s)]
*  entire Giants coverage was like, we don't have to worry about that side of the field. We could [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2363.28s)]
*  just cover him with one guy. The safety doesn't even have to shade over. That's Ben Simmons on [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2367.44s)]
*  offense. You don't have to shade over. It's like, what's he going to do? Can't shoot, doesn't want [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2371.6800000000003s)]
*  to shoot. He's not going to drive to the basket because he's the one getting fouled. So they're [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2375.52s)]
*  just trying to survive five minutes game back to Zubach. So he's plus 9.2 net heading into the game [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2379.76s)]
*  today. By far the best Clipper. He's played 2,600 plus minutes. He leads the league in offensive [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2385.6000000000004s)]
*  rebounds for the year. He's 17 and 13 since the All-Star break. He's 20 and 13. I think he's had [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2391.04s)]
*  15 double doubles in a row. He's shooting 65% since the All-Star break. And he stays on the court. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2396.64s)]
*  That's the thing like, like Jaren Jackson, I just feel like if I like, would you be shocked in the [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2404.24s)]
*  playing game? If Jaren Jackson has five fouls with 10 minutes to go in the fourth quarter of the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2409.52s)]
*  playing game, you wouldn't be because he can't stay on the court. Zubach contests all the time [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2414.08s)]
*  with his hands up, but he stays in the court. So I don't know. I just think with him and Leonard [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2418.48s)]
*  and Harden, that's not the best big three of the 16 playoff teams, but it's a legitimate big three [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2422.64s)]
*  if Kawhi is going to play this way, I think. Look, I'm on your side on this one. So I know [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2427.52s)]
*  it'd be better if we were to disagree about the whole thing. I mean, clearly Jaren Jackson has a [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2434.2400000000002s)]
*  much better offensive game than Zubach does, but he's asked to do two different things. I mean, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2438.0s)]
*  his skillset, I wouldn't even compare the two things. If I were with Memphis, I'd be like, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2441.36s)]
*  hey, Jaren, you know when the other team gets the ball and they're bringing it up the court, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2445.92s)]
*  run away from the guy with the ball in his hands. Like stop. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2450.2400000000002s)]
*  And maybe grab, grab like one more rebound a quarter would be awesome. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2453.44s)]
*  Couple more rebounds would be nice. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2457.2000000000003s)]
*  Maybe get to like nine. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2458.48s)]
*  Yeah. But Zuh, if you look at the rim protection stuff, like Chet's off the charts, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2460.2400000000002s)]
*  Perzingis' numbers are incredible, but Zuh's are really good there as well. So, you know, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2464.8s)]
*  maybe the downside of Zuh was maybe you can't play five out. You know, does it impact some [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2470.48s)]
*  of the driving lane stuff that you want to do if you want to have a norm Kawhi Harden group out [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2476.2400000000002s)]
*  there? Because I still feel like that's my favorite default of having any kind of big that can stretch [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2482.32s)]
*  a defense a little bit. So you have to worry about the shooting, but to have Harden not have a center [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2488.08s)]
*  as much as it's going to open up some space, like those two guys are just locked in right now. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2494.4s)]
*  And Kawhi doesn't really need to drive. It's a lot of pull up stuff with him. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2499.2s)]
*  And even Jimmy Butler, who's changed the story for the Warriors this season, like you saw when [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2503.12s)]
*  they got one-on-one, he was too big for Butler. He's too big for him. And it's not like Butler's [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2508.16s)]
*  small or like a guy you would question his strength or toughness, but Kawhi would get him in some [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2512.3999999999996s)]
*  spots like 12 feet in and you're like, he's going to have a chance. They had to put Draymond back [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2517.04s)]
*  on him. I was, I noted it because it was weird to see, I don't want to use the word bullied, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2521.12s)]
*  but basketball bullied where he just was too strong for Butler. And you always assume Butler [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2526.96s)]
*  in your head, he's like six, nine, two 40. And he's just not- [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2532.16s)]
*  It gives you a chance. Well, yes, six, seven, maybe, but a chance. You're thinking, okay, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2534.56s)]
*  at least I'm matching some of this. Kawhi is like, oh, this is great. Jimmy Butler's on me. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2538.4s)]
*  He's not afraid of him. He's not going to get in an alpha battle with him. He's just going to do his, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2542.0s)]
*  his machine thing. The other piece was Zubats and Harden together. Harden's had this before, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2545.76s)]
*  because he had it on the Rockets with Dwight during the last kind of stages of Dwight's Prime [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2552.72s)]
*  and then Capella too. But I mean, I'm talking big physical centers that are around the rim [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2557.2s)]
*  and he really used Dwight. I mean, they made the 2015 West finals. That team was good. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2562.3999999999996s)]
*  I think what he's established with Zubats is pretty great. Like that, like they're really attuned. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2568.08s)]
*  They'll run that high screen at the very top and then Zubats will roll down and he's almost like [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2575.12s)]
*  a left tackle. He's just like, he's kind of barreling into guys, knocking guys over and [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2580.32s)]
*  Harden always seems to know exactly where he is. I think they're really good. I was talking to a [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2584.7200000000003s)]
*  bunch of Clipper fans over the last couple of days and they were kind of deep down wondering [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2590.8s)]
*  if they were better off going to the seventh seed and winning the playing game and then playing [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2595.6800000000003s)]
*  Houston. But the rub on that is you don't get the six days of rest for Kawhi. So this worked out [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2599.6800000000003s)]
*  perfectly. I will say, I don't think it would have been a disaster for them if they fell to [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2606.0s)]
*  seven. I think this is worse for the Warriors because I don't think they want to put miles on [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2610.08s)]
*  these dudes. And I think it's, it's creaky to begin with. We've seen some games like they had that [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2615.04s)]
*  third and four last week and that Sunday game where Houston just annihilated them athletically [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2620.24s)]
*  and just seemed like they were 10 years younger than them. So now you're putting miles on them [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2625.6s)]
*  in the Tuesday game with Memphis. Now you're starting the playoffs. You just don't, it's just, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2629.68s)]
*  you're, you're adding miles to a team that doesn't need miles. Curry already looks, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2634.16s)]
*  you know, I don't know how many injuries he's nursing at this point, but it's at least three. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2638.64s)]
*  They needed this bad for everything you just said. And to see what stuff looked like after that time [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2643.68s)]
*  off, it's a bit like that Kyrie stuff that we used to talk about a couple of years ago when Kyrie was [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2650.24s)]
*  going off because he wasn't playing that much. It was like, I can't believe Kyrie's doing this. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2654.64s)]
*  He's barely even playing. And you're like, no, the whole point is this fresh. Like, can you imagine? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2661.9199999999996s)]
*  You only have to play like once a week. And I'm not even turning into the Kyrie conversation, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2666.8799999999997s)]
*  but I think it's just something to remember when somebody's not available all the time, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2670.64s)]
*  it actually can be an advantage as opposed to losing your rhythm. So in the games or Steph came [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2673.2s)]
*  back in that Memphis game, I was watching, like, holy shit, like he is flying around. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2678.16s)]
*  And I don't know that, you know, I'm necessarily like looking at it, being like worried. He had a [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2684.0s)]
*  really slow start. Then he has 18 to send it to overtime in the fourth quarter. So it's like, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2689.4399999999996s)]
*  okay, it's fine. He's relocating the way he should be. And, you know, I look at some of [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2694.24s)]
*  the Butler stuff because the record's so absurd. They're a completely different team since that [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2698.72s)]
*  trade in every statistical category, but maybe going to that game live against the Lakers where [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2703.12s)]
*  he decided to start playing like 14 minutes into the game. I'm like, you know, dude, these are, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2708.4799999999996s)]
*  these are great. They won that game and stuff was brilliant, but you're like, you're going to need [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2715.2s)]
*  to not be as, as passive. And he, and he wasn't, I don't think at the start of tonight at all, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2719.84s)]
*  like he got it going, I think when they needed him, but overall Butler still only taking 10 [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2726.6400000000003s)]
*  shots a game. He was taking 10 shots a game of Miami. The metric story was great for him because [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2731.52s)]
*  the free throw rate is so absurd, but they may, I don't know if it's a, hey, it's playoff Jimmy. So [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2736.1600000000003s)]
*  none of it really matters, but there's probably still, even with this great turnaround, probably [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2743.28s)]
*  moments for him where it's like, you need to be looking for your stuff a little bit more. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2748.08s)]
*  Cause I thought there were drives. It felt like he was taking over the game and then he just [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2752.48s)]
*  shoot again for a while. Yeah. He, he'll go through these spells where I would just think that in the, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2756.88s)]
*  the post season and his, his, his work over the last few years tells us that he's going to be that [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2763.92s)]
*  guy again. But I think it gets lost in this turnaround because he still is really pacing [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2769.84s)]
*  himself at times offensively. But the fact that he's even there has made Steph's life better [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2775.92s)]
*  because when they were, when they were up, just falling apart, it's like, dude, you're asking [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2781.44s)]
*  Steph to run around for 20 seconds and get free and nobody cares. Like nobody cares about any of [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2786.08s)]
*  these other guys. The free throws are huge. They stop the game. They put pressure on the other team. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2790.64s)]
*  He's so competitive. The Clippers are a bad matchup for them. They've been a bad matchup for them for [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2796.32s)]
*  a couple of years. I've been to games where I was like, how are there, how are the Clippers [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2801.36s)]
*  winning this? They would just be able to turn it on. I don't know. I, I, I wonder in a weird way [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2805.44s)]
*  if this Memphis playing game is easy for the Warriors and they get the two seven with Houston [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2812.96s)]
*  and they can somehow from a health standpoint be okay. This probably worked out. I know the, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2819.04s)]
*  I know not getting the rest sucks, but playing a Houston team that has no playoff pedigree at all, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2823.6800000000003s)]
*  that's like a really, really young playoff team going against Steph and Jimmy and Draymond. Right. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2829.84s)]
*  And you can take that one and then round two, you know, potentially the Lakers or the, or [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2834.96s)]
*  Minnesota. But if it's the Lakers, I think that Warriors match up really well with the Lakers. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2842.1600000000003s)]
*  They're just going to play small against the Lakers. It's small ball against small ball. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2846.8s)]
*  And I think they're going to be really comfortable against them. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2850.4s)]
*  Yeah. I think you're right about that. I don't know if the Lakers who want to play small [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2853.04s)]
*  played in the golden States hands of that last regular season game a couple of weeks ago. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2857.68s)]
*  Well, clearly the Warriors would rather go small, even though they're playing post, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2862.56s)]
*  but he's kind of that five out guy that we're talking about here a little bit. They don't want [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2867.2799999999997s)]
*  to play Jackson Hayes. I don't know if that'll be a match specific thing for the playoffs, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2870.16s)]
*  but clearly their preference is Ruy at center. And it's not that they're small, right? Because [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2873.6s)]
*  they're big at all their positions other than Vincent or if good, when we're getting any minutes, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2877.7599999999998s)]
*  like they're actually a really big team. But if they want to, they're bulky, they're a bulky team. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2882.56s)]
*  You like their girth? Yeah, they got a lot of girth. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2887.12s)]
*  I was trying to figure all this stuff out this morning. Like I was going through the regular [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2890.3199999999997s)]
*  season series and then who missed how many games and that ends up. It's the worst ever. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2893.68s)]
*  I did it again this year. I hate myself. It's a nightmare. Because even this game with [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2899.12s)]
*  the Clippers and Golden State, it's the first time everybody was ready to go. I mean, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2903.7599999999998s)]
*  Kawhi and some of the other matchups hasn't even played against any of these teams [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2907.52s)]
*  because he came back so much later. And sometimes the schedule works out. It's like, all right, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2911.8399999999997s)]
*  they've already played each other four times, but the fourth game was in December. So then you go, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2915.28s)]
*  okay, what does that even mean as you get ready for the playoffs here? But that Houston game, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2919.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up because I was thinking, all right, is there a good part of this? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2923.76s)]
*  I would think the Warriors would rather play the Lakers just because there's not a size thing [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2927.76s)]
*  that's looming like Zubach. Granted, he wasn't going to be in the matchup in the first round. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2934.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, in this case, it'd be a Shungun. Like, what do we do? Do we keep loony out? Because did you [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2939.36s)]
*  notice in that Cooper game, the Warriors were playing really well with about four minutes left [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2944.56s)]
*  and Draymond wasn't out there. And it was loony because they needed him for Zubach and Draymond [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2948.7999999999997s)]
*  was on the bench and the Warriors, the ball was moving and looked good. And it got to the point [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2953.36s)]
*  where I was like, I wonder if they could bring Draymond in. And then obviously they went to [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2956.64s)]
*  commercial came back, they brought him in. But you know, that's not that that's when, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2959.36s)]
*  when he's not out there sometimes, I'm not saying they're better without him, but there's [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2964.7999999999997s)]
*  lineups without him that I kind of like, especially when Podziemski and Butler are [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2969.36s)]
*  flying around. I think Moody, Moody's turned into a guy that I really feel like is a guy now. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2974.7200000000003s)]
*  Like defensively, he's really, really high level. Don't you think? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2980.7200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. And he deserves a ton of credit for turning himself into this. But I mean, he had [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2984.6400000000003s)]
*  plays where he stripped Norm just one on one at the top of it as they were trying to get another [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2989.6800000000003s)]
*  offense. He had the block on the left side and it's just Moody's definitely, you're right. Like [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2995.04s)]
*  he's turned himself into somebody that Kirk can probably trust depending on what the perimeter [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=2999.36s)]
*  matchups are there. But I think that Houston win in Golden State going back not that long ago, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3002.56s)]
*  just a few days ago, it was definitely a week ago. Yeah. He's won a 10. Like that's one of [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3008.0s)]
*  those Butler games where I'm like, does, does he need to take more than seven shots in 33 minutes? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3014.0s)]
*  And sometimes the shot attempts get lost in the free throws, but they only took four free throws [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3019.84s)]
*  in that one. And you had 42 shot attempts between Pajemski, Heald and Payton where they shot it well, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3022.88s)]
*  but that's probably not what you want. And they sold out. I mean, Houston did a terrific job [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3029.92s)]
*  of not only a men being on him, but making sure that wherever he was going, there was going to be [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3035.76s)]
*  a second defender there. So yeah, it's kind of your point. Is it better to be against them because [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3039.36s)]
*  they don't have the big that scares you or is it, we're going to throw a million athletes with a [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3046.08s)]
*  ton of length at Steph. And so when we're done with a man, then it's going to be Tari. And then [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3051.92s)]
*  we're going to have Brooks beat them up for a little bit here. Like that's where Butler, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3055.6s)]
*  you're probably going, we need you to take 16 shots tonight in these games. Yeah. That, I mean, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3058.8s)]
*  that game they played Thursday, Friday, and again, older team, and they just seem like they had no [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3063.04s)]
*  legs for that Houston game. But that's also the fear if you're playing Houston, because that team [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3068.32s)]
*  is always going to have energy. They're a really tough team. One of the things I love is- They had a day off though. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3071.76s)]
*  They had a day off in between there. Yeah, I know. But I'm saying the Thursday, Friday, those were [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3077.2000000000003s)]
*  two tough ones in a row because they're playing, you know, contenders. But- No, you're right. Those [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3081.68s)]
*  were big time games. Eme will definitely, he's proven he is not, he does not kowtow to the super [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3086.3999999999996s)]
*  duper stars in the league. He likes to start ship to them, talk to them, likes to get his guys fired [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3093.2s)]
*  up to go against them. And they have a bunch of pit bulls to throw at Curry. They have a low post [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3098.16s)]
*  guy that's going to either force Draymond to have to guard a center or, you know, they could go that [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3103.12s)]
*  double big lineup, which I think is not going to be easy for the Warriors. I don't love the matchup [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3108.88s)]
*  for them, but man, that Warriors, I mean that Rockets playoff and experience you saw today, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3114.88s)]
*  I kind of feel like they wanted that Nuggets game. I watched, did you watch the first half of that? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3119.84s)]
*  You have that on? Yeah. I mean, you could look at, say they waved the white flag, but it's because [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3124.32s)]
*  they were getting beat. They were down 20. They were getting their ass kicked. They played everybody [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3128.0s)]
*  and they were trying, they were playing hard. They wanted the game. I think, you know, knowing a little [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3132.08s)]
*  bit about EMA, I think he was like, look, this is a playoff game for us. Let's treat it like a [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3137.04s)]
*  playoff game. Let's see what we got. And they sucked. So not awesome for them. And conversely, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3140.56s)]
*  that was the best game I've seen Denver play in a while. And maybe this new coach thing, if you read [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3145.68s)]
*  about all the dysfunction that was going on behind the scenes, maybe there's something to it. It's [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3152.24s)]
*  like, it's like peeling off, you know, peeling off a huge bandaid and just being like, fuck it. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3156.88s)]
*  I hate that we, I don't think it'll happen this time around, but we've lost Steph in the playoffs [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3162.8s)]
*  twice because of the play-in setup. What do you mean? Oh, for LA. Oh, I know. No, he's, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3168.56s)]
*  he's 0-3 in play-in games. Is that true? Oh my God, you're right. He lost to the Lakers. And then [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3175.92s)]
*  because they lost the Lakers, they had to play Memphis and he had 37 and 39 in those games and [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3184.4s)]
*  they lost. And then in 24, he lost to Sacramento last year. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3189.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, the good news is, uh, I think Memphis just looks awful. I mean, you're not catching [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3196.7999999999997s)]
*  a team at a better time than this, whatever is happening with this Grizzlies team right now. So [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3204.64s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not too concerned about the words. They did something weird that I don't remember [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3208.7999999999997s)]
*  with the schedule and I'm excited to talk about the matchups. There, there's no Thursday game this [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3213.04s)]
*  year, which I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case the last couple of years, both of the play-in [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3218.24s)]
*  games are Friday. Maybe they did that before and I just forgot. So if for some reason, the Warriors [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3222.72s)]
*  lost that Tuesday game, they'd have to play Friday and then immediately, uh, on Sunday, which would [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3228.64s)]
*  not be awesome for them. Can we talk about, uh, all the, the, the matchups that came out of this [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3233.8399999999997s)]
*  quick? So we Warriors Rockets, which we hit, um, do you share my same concerns with Houston? Like [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3240.0s)]
*  yeah, I know it's in there, but playoffs are a different animal. Do you have another level to go [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3246.16s)]
*  to or do you think there's something more there that I'm not seeing? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3249.7599999999998s)]
*  I think they're really good. Um, but you know, we're looking at a two seed that over the course [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3254.7999999999997s)]
*  of 82 games, it's kind of like our Verneau ambush talking about Memphis, where it was like, hey, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3259.7599999999998s)]
*  they were the two seed, they were the two seed, hey, they were the two seed before all this stuff. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3268.08s)]
*  I mean, it's like three years, you can point to them like, Hey, being the two seed, I mean, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3270.96s)]
*  like, Hey, being the two seed, the two seed, some years sounds way better years removed than the [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3274.48s)]
*  reality of like what the records were of the teams that year. Denver was a one seed that year when [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3279.76s)]
*  Memphis was a two seed. And I think Denver had 53 wins, uh, in 23 when they won the title. And then [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3283.68s)]
*  if you go through the rest of the seeding, I mean, that's why it's so crazy to kind of look back and [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3288.96s)]
*  you're like, Hey, Memphis was the two seed, but they had 51 wins. Sacramento was a three seed with [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3292.56s)]
*  48 wins. 48 wins now in the West would put you, um, seven or eight seed. Yeah. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3296.72s)]
*  So conference was so much weaker and more injuries, all kinds of stupid stuff. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3304.88s)]
*  So look, I, I definitely will have hesitation about big boy playoff closing offensive minutes [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3310.08s)]
*  for the Houston Rockets. I think it's completely fair. And I think you, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3317.36s)]
*  Doko will decide on the fly. I, I would be shocked if it's a steady closing five [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3321.6s)]
*  during clutch time for them, where I think he'll, he'll go with some guys and they'll [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3328.56s)]
*  abandon others and he won't give a shit, which is actually probably the best thing you could [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3333.68s)]
*  hope for with a coach where he's like this night. I mean, we just saw, we did a conversation on it, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3336.7999999999997s)]
*  right? About this exact topic. And you know, I looked, some people were giving a shit, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3341.2s)]
*  Rockets fans like, Oh, they would never do that. That night. I think the next night [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3347.36s)]
*  he benched Jaylen green with five minutes to go in the game and then brought them in with 11 seconds [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3351.44s)]
*  left because they were down. The game was already over and it was like, can you get us a bucket here? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3355.04s)]
*  So yeah, Jaylen's probably the best option still with Van Vliet, but I don't know, man. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3358.0s)]
*  I've seen enough of them this year to know that it gets clogged despite how great their record [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3366.56s)]
*  was in the clutch. Does that, do you have anything else? It's a team that looks better when they're [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3369.76s)]
*  up 10. Um, I think this series will, I think sets a set the, uh, standard for lobbying the press [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3374.24s)]
*  between games to get whatever agenda you want from, from, from the next game. You know, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3383.2s)]
*  Kerr is going to be working hard. The whole, uh, the whole Houston hold staff away from the ball. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3388.3999999999996s)]
*  They're too physical with them. They're getting away with stuff. They'll send clips. They'll do [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3394.96s)]
*  that whole thing. And then, you know, there'll be a backlash to that. And I just think it's going [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  to be a war of words. Um, but you also have, you've Dylan Brooks in this series, pre-storied [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3403.3599999999997s)]
*  history, Golden State. Um, you have a Golden State Houston history. That's pretty good. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3410.24s)]
*  So if this is what we end up with, um, and, and a weird matchup where you have. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3416.3199999999997s)]
*  Size against a team that doesn't really want to play with size and then older, older perimeter [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3423.2s)]
*  guys against this kind of new wave of perimeter guys who we haven't really seen in the spotlight [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3429.7599999999998s)]
*  like this. So, um, it's a good one. I would, I would personally still take Golden State if I had [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3434.32s)]
*  to do you want to guess the line? Oh, they don't have a line for that yet. I do have the lines. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3440.2400000000002s)]
*  The matchup for Memphis. I do have lines for the other two. Have you looked or no? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3443.84s)]
*  I haven't. Okay. Let's play a quick guest lines. Trademark cousin cell. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3448.56s)]
*  Lakers. Okay. Go ahead. Lakers, Minnesota, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3454.7200000000003s)]
*  LA has home court. What do you think the line is on Fandel right now? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3458.7200000000003s)]
*  For the series Lakers minus one 85. Wow. That was really good. Minus 172. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3464.32s)]
*  And we'll talk about that in one second. Uh, Denver Clippers. What do you have Denver as home court? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3471.44s)]
*  Uh, I'm going to say Clippers. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3476.2400000000002s)]
*  Cause look, this has been going on for a while. This is like a month of this. Okay. So this isn't [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3480.6400000000003s)]
*  new. Um, I almost feel like this is might be closer to Clippers minus 200. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3484.56s)]
*  Denver is home court. Oh, so they're just going with the home court part of this. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3491.44s)]
*  So Denver's favorite. I'm just reminding you Clippers minus one 50. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3498.0s)]
*  Nuggets minus one 44. Sounds like we have some wagers to make. I felt the same way. I thought [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3502.56s)]
*  it would be like a pick them and maybe it will be by the time, uh, by the time we get there. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3509.28s)]
*  Clippers and six is an interesting, interesting bet. And then in the East, which you probably are [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3516.08s)]
*  that actually shocks me. I mean, I realized that it's Denver and I know that it's Yolkich, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3520.88s)]
*  which I learned from one of the playoff previews on ESPN, but I, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3524.7999999999997s)]
*  this Clippers thing is fucking real, man. So, but you know, do we, are we, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3531.2799999999997s)]
*  are we tricking ourselves? Okay. Right. The quiet gets hurt. That's we all understand what is [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3538.32s)]
*  potentially in play for a guy that's in street clothes to close out the last four years, I think [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3545.12s)]
*  in the playoffs, but are we tricking ourselves into believing that the elevated pace understanding [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3548.96s)]
*  hardens tendencies more the deer in the headlight game two or game four from him. And then we see [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3555.68s)]
*  it and we go, how could you have ever picked this team? Cause I'm going to pick them against Denver. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3560.8s)]
*  I don't know how far I'm going to go with it, but I'm going to pick them against Denver. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3565.2s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie I'm 100% picking the, I'm against Denver. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3567.6s)]
*  And it feels like we're in a law and order SVU episode where it's like, I've watched this exact [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3570.16s)]
*  episode 13 times. Why do I think it's not the dead lady's husband is because he's a doctor and [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3576.4s)]
*  he seems like a great guy. Don't go back to the hospital. He's fine. This guy loved her. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3582.48s)]
*  That's how I feel about if you like the Clippers, it's like, this is the year [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3590.8s)]
*  Kawai stays healthy and this is the year James Harden isn't going to shit on himself in a playoff [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3594.7200000000003s)]
*  series. So we got this. Is there, is there anything too? Cause I want to ask you this question, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3598.88s)]
*  Harden not having to be the one because of Kawai and it's like, okay, but that was supposed to be [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3604.24s)]
*  Embiid. So Harden wasn't supposed to be the one in the Sixer series, but then we could have this [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3610.64s)]
*  whole other Embiid playoff discussion that we don't have to do this year. Is there anything to [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3615.2s)]
*  the importance of him being reduced going in that makes you feel better? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3621.44s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie 100%. Well, there's two things that make me feel better about him. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3626.64s)]
*  One is that this is the best supporting cast for him that I can remember him having. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3630.8s)]
*  It's all the things you would want to put around him. If we were just like, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3638.88s)]
*  I'm going to come over to your house. Let's spend the next two hours picking [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3642.7200000000003s)]
*  types of players that you would want to put around James Harden. I'll come over tonight. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3646.2400000000002s)]
*  But you'd want a rebounding center who could finish around the basket and finish the alley-oops. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3652.96s)]
*  You'd want an older star who could be like, I've got this. That's Kawai. You'd want some streaky [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3658.16s)]
*  shooters. That's Norm Powell. Who's the other streaky shooter in that team? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3664.8799999999997s)]
*  Derrick Jones Jr. I guess he is kind of streaky. And then you'd want length to protect him on [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3670.7999999999997s)]
*  defense so that he didn't have to play defense. And then the Chris Dunpees. I just really like [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3675.6s)]
*  their roster. I think they did an awesome job. I think we probably do a little bit better. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3680.96s)]
*  Derrick Jones things. Well, I'm just saying realistically, if you're using the salary cap [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3685.04s)]
*  and you had to put together a team, it's going to probably look something like this. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3689.84s)]
*  But yeah, the Kawai thing, this is what all the Cooper fans I know, they're like, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3694.48s)]
*  it's a yeah, but it just is. Every year he's pulled the rug out from under them. And every [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3699.2s)]
*  year they believed and thought he was going to be finally this is, and then the rug gets pulled out. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3704.24s)]
*  This is like year six of this for them. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3711.68s)]
*  So you're saying better than Westbrook and then PJ Tucker at center. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3715.04s)]
*  Yeah, slightly. I think so. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3719.2799999999997s)]
*  The death screens from zoo. Like you run into one of his screens, you're going to get a step. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3722.16s)]
*  The other thing with them is I just don't this Denver bench. I just, I'll say this. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3730.16s)]
*  I refuse to believe Westbrook won't be heard from in the wrong way in a Cooper's Nugget series. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3738.24s)]
*  He's just looming in the wrong way because there's going to be a game. There's going to be a Jamal [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3745.04s)]
*  Murray has to come out because his knee's not feeling great. Somebody's in foul trouble where [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3750.4s)]
*  Westbrook is just going to be involved. And I've just, I've seen enough with him at crunch time. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3753.92s)]
*  I just don't, I don't think he's somebody that can be out there in the final four minutes of a big [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3757.6s)]
*  game. I don't know if he will. I think that Sacramento game that might've been his past week. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3762.08s)]
*  No, I think that that was a sign. I think that was a sign they went with Pickett to close when [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3766.96s)]
*  they drove with Pickett. Yeah. Right. So with, with Adeline. It's like never been in any games. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3771.84s)]
*  Like that, that's the thing. I'm like, Jesus, that makes me more nervous. I don't know which one I [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3776.48s)]
*  would want less. Just probably pick full statement on this. Yeah. Westbrook's actually taking, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3783.36s)]
*  I think too much shit on this. Oh, yes. Yeah. Rosilla backs Westbrook. Now if you're telling [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3792.48s)]
*  me he had to not make any mistakes all season. Okay. Fine. And the fact that I think game of the [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3800.0s)]
*  year is still the overtime 60 point triple double from Yocage against Minnesota because you had Ant [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3804.24s)]
*  and Yocage dueling each other. But you're right. The stakes are not the same as game 82, but that's [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3808.88s)]
*  my favorite game of the season. And you have the Westbrook layup or not killing clock or then the [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3813.76s)]
*  foul at the end. But because everybody was watching that game, cause it's one of the best games in the [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3818.8s)]
*  entire year, then it started turning to like, look, if you're expecting a mistake free experience [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3822.56s)]
*  from him, then just pick a different guy. Look, even Steph, who I love, he had two bad turnovers [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3826.96s)]
*  late in this game. He got caught in the corner. He had another thing he was trying to do in the [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3832.2400000000002s)]
*  baseline, but the 18 points kind of makes up for that a little bit. But with all of this, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3835.2s)]
*  because of his history where it felt like every place he's gone post-OKC couldn't wait for him [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3840.08s)]
*  to get out of the, although I'd say Washington. It turns into the half and half in the fridge that [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3846.32s)]
*  you have to sniff and you're like, oh, I got to throw this out. Although I think Wizards fans [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3849.36s)]
*  enjoyed it. I think Wizards fans enjoyed when he was there. So I would add that one to like the [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3853.04s)]
*  positive part of this. And sure. Should Malone have let him gone to LA and get the vet treatment [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3858.4s)]
*  that the other guys did? I don't know. Like whatever that's, I don't think that's why they [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3863.68s)]
*  fell apart, but he's being thrown into the storyline of this. If you tell, well, Westbrook [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3866.96s)]
*  also did this and there was some complaints over the minutes. I've been maybe because my standards [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3873.44s)]
*  or expectations for him are so low. He's done the best job he's ever done in his career post-OKC [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3879.36s)]
*  accepting his role. We agree. I'm just saying. You can't believe I'm saying it. No, if he's the [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3885.76s)]
*  sixth most important person on your team, there might be some issues at this point in his career. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3892.2400000000002s)]
*  We should have mentioned him earlier at the top when we were talking about people taking the [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3897.2000000000003s)]
*  mantle for Rory. Now that Rory's one who would be the best people Westbrook kind of rising up [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3901.36s)]
*  as a super sub in the playoffs, helping drag the Nuggets. It's not the same though. It's not the [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3907.2s)]
*  same. Like if Chris Paul gets a ring next year, by the way, shout out Chris Paul, 82 games. 82 [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3911.9199999999996s)]
*  games. If he gets a ring now, it doesn't mean like, Hey, I was right. So I also don't know that Rory [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3916.64s)]
*  had the, as many stops, as many tumultuous stops as Westbrook did. So I don't know if that one works. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3927.2799999999997s)]
*  Westbrook 10 years from now, it's going to be great for him when it's a little like what's [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3935.92s)]
*  happened to Carmelo and some others where we just forget all the best. I'm like, Russell Westbrook, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3940.7999999999997s)]
*  who's the problem? MVP, triple double. Are you anticipating kids don't even know? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3944.4s)]
*  I think it could be there. If you put together those, they're going to be like, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3952.48s)]
*  how many rings did he have? 25 rebounds in a game. I'm convinced the Clippers will beat the Nuggets [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3955.92s)]
*  and also fully expect something heartbreaking to happen for them. It's one of those I'm going [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3964.16s)]
*  to bet the Clippers and probably regret it by game three. We're going to take a break and then [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3970.3999999999996s)]
*  we got to talk a couple of the other playoffs series here. This episode is brought to you by [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3974.56s)]
*  Mikulovultra. Spring is here. My favorite time of the year. That means the NBA playoffs are here too. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3978.08s)]
*  What am I the most excited about? I'm excited to see if the Celtics can defend their title. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3985.44s)]
*  I'm excited to see if Steph Curry and Jokic can keep going and going and going round after round. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3989.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm excited for the potential of an LA versus LA playoff series. It's never happened. Clippers, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=3995.68s)]
*  Lakers never in my lifetime. Is OKC for real? Is Cleveland for real? Is SGA going to prove that he [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4001.4399999999996s)]
*  is the best scoring guard in the postseason? Basically since Michael Jordan, since Colby Bryant, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4007.68s)]
*  is he on that level? We're all going to find out. There's plenty to look forward to on and off the [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4014.7999999999997s)]
*  court like Mikulovultra courtside. That's another thing. It's getting fans closer to the game with [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4018.4s)]
*  unique prizes. Plus they're giving you a chance to win tickets to the NBA finals. You heard me. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4023.2000000000003s)]
*  The NBA finals, which I hope are in Boston, just head to mikulovultra.com slash NBA finals. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4027.92s)]

*  may apply. Void. We're prohibited. All right. So we got Minnesota Lakers. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4055.2s)]
*  This feels like a win for the Lakers and I'm not sure who I would have wanted to play the [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4062.4s)]
*  least if I were them, but because it basically came down to the two, the Clippers, Golden State [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4066.88s)]
*  or Minnesota. They were going to play one of those teams being in the three spot. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4071.6s)]
*  In Minnesota, I think feels like the right outcome for them because I don't know how [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4076.48s)]
*  Gobert exists in this series. So let's start there. How does Gobert exist in this series? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4081.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh man. I mean, Luca was funny when he was tearing up. Did you hear about this? They asked him which [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4088.56s)]
*  moment got him in the tribute video. And he was like, when I hit that step back on Gobert. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4094.08s)]
*  Gobert played it great. I thought dudes hate Gobert. Kevin Porter Jr. Not afraid to get into [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4100.72s)]
*  it with everybody. Just actually important for Milwaukee lately and playing some good basketball. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4106.88s)]
*  Getting into the woods. Everybody. Everybody. What happens if he ends up on the Pistons next year? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4112.8s)]
*  We might have to have security guards on hand for every game. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4119.36s)]
*  Beef stews is like, look, first practice, new guys, we beat the shit out of you. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4124.639999999999s)]
*  But it's just sort of like, I don't know if you saw Colors, older movie. We're just going to have to [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4128.88s)]
*  like initiate you. So, you know, ice up. Don't look at me. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4134.4s)]
*  I think you're right about that because it's a bit like the [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4141.36s)]
*  EMA thing that we were talking about there with Finch. Like will he, because there were times [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4144.8s)]
*  of the year it felt like he was sick of Randall. Randall's probably played the best basketball. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4149.2s)]
*  They needed him huge in that Memphis game. He was fantastic when they just ran away from the [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4154.08s)]
*  Grizzlies. Gobert is like, especially in that matchup he's closing. But I do wonder with the [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4158.72s)]
*  stuff that we're talking about, how the Lakers prefer to be real perimeter based if it'd be a [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4164.56s)]
*  situation where they're going to be, you know, bringing Rudy out. Because like the best part [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4168.16s)]
*  about Rudy is the guy screens online. He plays his ass off. He hustles like crazy, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4172.48s)]
*  but nobody wants to pass to him. And then if he gets caught in a switch hunting season, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4176.4s)]
*  then it could be, I think like, like Houston, Bill, I think Minnesota's going to have a bunch of different looks. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4180.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. He needs like a Shangoon Adams combo to make sense in a series. This, they're just going to [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4185.36s)]
*  play Luca and LeBron and Rui as much as they possibly can with Reeves and Pickagard. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4190.32s)]
*  And they're just going to spread them out. JJ, as we've discussed many times, this coaching [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4197.04s)]
*  staff's done a really good job at figuring out what the matchup is and then how to exploit. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4202.0s)]
*  They're going to exploit him and they're going to play him off the court, but that's going to lead [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4207.04s)]
*  to Minnesota probably ending up with Nasreed and Randall and McDaniels and Edwards and D. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4210.8s)]
*  Fincenzo if they want size or Conley, if they don't care about it as the five they're going against. And [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4217.52s)]
*  that's going to be hard for, for the Lakers defensively. I think they're going to have all [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4223.28s)]
*  these, they're going to attack Reeves. They're going to probably try to get Edwards and his many [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4227.76s)]
*  switches as they possibly can against Reeves. And they're going to have the same shooting stuff. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4231.44s)]
*  And I actually think this will be a higher scoring series than I think people realize [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4236.0s)]
*  because people think of Minnesota as this awesome defensive team. And you know, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4241.839999999999s)]
*  if you take Gobert out of it, it changes a little bit, but I think Minnesota has a real chance in [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  the series. I think you're kind of shortchanging the perimeter guys though, from what we've seen [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4249.599999999999s)]
*  in the playoffs last year. The Minnesota perimeter guys. Defensively, Jadon's really [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4255.76s)]
*  good on the ball against somebody smaller. The problem is, is him on the ball against Luca. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4260.8s)]
*  Like I think we saw it already. We need Gobert against him. Right. Yeah. Exactly. So [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4264.72s)]
*  with Jadon's defensive resume, which I think all of us really like, that's probably not going to [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4268.72s)]
*  hold up in your right. We saw some of that stuff last year. Well, they could do the whole thing [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4274.24s)]
*  where they're like, let's take out Reeves. Let's try to take out Reeves as much as we possibly can [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4278.0s)]
*  because Luca and LeBron are going to get all their stuff anyway. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4284.56s)]
*  What do you mean offensively? Like, I'm just saying like, just make sure Reeves doesn't get [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4290.4800000000005s)]
*  going when they have those spots where like, you know, they take Luke out and LeBron and Reeves [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4294.88s)]
*  together. When it's the two of them be like, look, we got to take out Reeves. They're never, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4299.28s)]
*  they're never going to stop Luca. The thing that worries me more from Minnesota is Rando, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4303.84s)]
*  who, as you mentioned, has been really good the last, like, I don't know, four or five, six weeks, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4308.4s)]
*  but part of it is because he's so physical and he's, especially if you guard him with anybody [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4313.759999999999s)]
*  smaller, he really has been bully balling people lately, but you're not bullying balling any of [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4318.879999999999s)]
*  those dudes on the Lakers. Those guys have more size than he does, you know? So then it comes down [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4322.96s)]
*  to, if you're looking at scoring and the end of the game stuff, it's going to be a lot of Edwards [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4327.839999999999s)]
*  and we've seen mixed results with that. When Edwards is like in the high twenties, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4335.280000000001s)]
*  you know, if he has a 31 field goal game, I never really liked Minnesota as much. I like when it's [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4339.76s)]
*  a little more democratic with the ball usage. The other thing too was three other games were [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4346.160000000001s)]
*  October 22nd, December 2nd, December 13th. No, I looked us up. Yeah. We didn't even see like both [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4354.72s)]
*  full teams that we have now against each other. So we have no idea what to expect. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4360.320000000001s)]
*  No, but I think attacking Luca is going to happen, you know, but they're probably just [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4363.6s)]
*  going to double Ant and then go, all right, and the McDaniels, Conley minutes, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4369.76s)]
*  go ahead and shoot. And if we get burned by that, fine. Maybe it changes with DiVincenzo. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4376.88s)]
*  And then I think there's a lot of, there's just a lot of room for Randall here because you're going [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4381.6s)]
*  to sell out to stop Ant. You're going to keep two with the ball on him on all this stuff. You're [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4384.96s)]
*  going to have to help out Luca. You know, it depends like little brawn energy level, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4388.0s)]
*  you know, it's, it's fascinating because you went to that game when he came back against Chicago [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4393.36s)]
*  and it would make sense. He'd had times off, but he moved so well in that game. And then you can [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4398.0s)]
*  turn on a Lakers game two nights later and you're like, uh, what's going on? And then yeah, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4402.24s)]
*  against Dallas, we saw him last week. Yeah. Didn't you go a couple of games ago? I did. How did he [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4407.12s)]
*  look at that game? It was fine, but it there's like, clearly he knows how to pace himself [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4414.96s)]
*  probably better than anybody in the entire league. Like this is like year four or five. We talked [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4422.4s)]
*  about him like, yeah, he kind of made spots. It's like, all right, yep. He had 30, 12 and 11 again. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4426.08s)]
*  So, um, he's doing fine. And I'd imagine that his intensity on some of the defensive stuff where I [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4430.16s)]
*  don't know that he can get away with the kind of switching where it's like, Hey, you go, like, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4435.84s)]
*  I'm always staying here. So I don't have to move on a switch or I'm going to pre-switch something [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4441.04s)]
*  to get out of it ahead of time so that I'm not in this thing over and over again. I think in the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4444.96s)]
*  regular season, you can get away with some of that stuff. I don't know that that'll happen in the [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4448.96s)]
*  playoffs. And I imagine his intensity and the time off and a little bit, it's just an easier [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4452.72s)]
*  schedule than what you have in the regular season, even with the great intensity. Yeah. We always [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4457.6s)]
*  seem to forget that it's like, Hey, these, these built-in days off, you're staying in the same [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4461.84s)]
*  place for a little while. Yeah. You get like three days off between game one and game two. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4465.36s)]
*  After you've already gotten a week off, it's perfect for him. So I think it's expected that [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4469.52s)]
*  he's going to be more intense with all this kind of stuff, but, you know, it may come down to like [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4473.92s)]
*  the Rui part of it where Gobert has to, has to respect him and he's shooting from three. So, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4478.240000000001s)]
*  so Rui's in the screen or something like that. It's like, okay, well, I can't, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4484.160000000001s)]
*  I can't ignore this guy. I get that might be the difference in all this stuff because we know all [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4487.92s)]
*  the stars are going to get... Is Rui on your first team? I can't believe how much I ended up liking [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4492.72s)]
*  this guy team. Well, I would say... Because I was starting at about a zero with him. Yeah. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4498.16s)]
*  That's the thing. And now I'm at about an 81. Everything we're always talking about is based on [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4505.28s)]
*  like, well, where were you before? Like, you really like him. No, he was an 11 out of a hundred. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4509.04s)]
*  Yeah. And now he's like 50. So yeah, that's, doesn't mean I'm in love with that guy. I like, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4513.12s)]
*  I like his competitiveness and I do think when he's good, if he's good in a game, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4517.12s)]
*  they become really hard to beat. I thought... If he has it going, it's like, oh shit. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4522.24s)]
*  He reminded me a lot of Kat. Like you sit there and say, well, Kat was a good matchup for Jokic. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4527.68s)]
*  And you go, all right, well, you know, is it 30 points? It's really the difference in these [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4531.76s)]
*  playoff games because Jokic is going to get his 30. Was it an easy 30 or was it a hard 30? And I [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4536.16s)]
*  think Kat at least provided some kind of resistance to him. And I thought that regular season game [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4540.4800000000005s)]
*  where the Lakers put it on them, they're really good on how they didn't want to space the floor [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4545.04s)]
*  defensively. And a lot of that started with Rui being tasked with, can you just at least challenge [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4548.4800000000005s)]
*  him on catches? Can you make him have to work a little bit more? And I thought he had a really [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4553.76s)]
*  good game there. Well, we have a lot of time to talk about that series in the East. We ended up [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4557.68s)]
*  with Pistons-Nicks and we ended up with Bucks-Pacers and the Pacers are minus two 30 favorites over the [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4562.400000000001s)]
*  Bucks, which I think is factoring in. People don't seem to think we're going to see Dame again. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4568.56s)]
*  But the way Giannis is playing the last couple of weeks and there's, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4574.400000000001s)]
*  there's a weird energy to him now that I kind of like. Did you see all the stuff he did in the [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4580.56s)]
*  Pistons game? I watched the whole game. I loved it. There's been signs of this before. He's done this [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4585.280000000001s)]
*  in the past a couple of times because I think the perception is, oh, Giannis, he's such a sweetheart [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4591.84s)]
*  of a guy. And it's actually kind of a little bit nastier than I think people realize. But in that [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4596.96s)]
*  Pistons game, he was really like fucking with them. And it got me excited for the Indiana series [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4601.200000000001s)]
*  because Indiana has a better team. They've been playing better for three months. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4607.76s)]
*  They have home court. They're going to push the pace. I think they're going to make it really [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4612.639999999999s)]
*  hard for the Bucks guards just to even bring the ball up and start the offense. But yet Giannis is [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4616.32s)]
*  on a tear. And we'll see, we'll see what happens with, with, could Giannis beat the Pacers [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4622.08s)]
*  basically by himself would be the scenario. I wouldn't bet against it. Would you? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4629.84s)]
*  No, I wouldn't because I feel like we're going to look back at this Giannis stretch and go, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4634.32s)]
*  he only won MVP out of this whole thing. And I mean, granted, everybody's going to remember [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4639.2s)]
*  what Jokic should be doing here, but this is almost like a Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali thing [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4642.88s)]
*  because I look at the numbers and it's not like when you watch it, it deceives you. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4648.639999999999s)]
*  It's, it's just so stupid how good he is. And if you are not ready for it, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4655.44s)]
*  I know this isn't new, but watching that Detroit game in particular, because I want to see how [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4662.88s)]
*  playing out, Cade was coming off the great Knicks finish. So I want to see kind of how they're going [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4667.04s)]
*  to defend him. And then we were kind of looking at like playoff seating and wondering what you [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4671.28s)]
*  could have as a potential matchup with all this stuff. But he, he's going crazy the whole time, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4675.12s)]
*  which is my favorite thing about him is that he is that competitive. So when he blocks Beasley shot, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4681.6s)]
*  which was a huge shot in the game and Beasley who feels himself the entire two fucking hours [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4685.6s)]
*  of a basketball game. So there were already gotten into it. Right. And Kevin Porter Jr. dunks on [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4689.68s)]
*  Dern, which was filthy, lets him have it a little bit. Dern comes down, screens the shit out of [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4696.240000000001s)]
*  them. Porter doesn't like it. Porter runs right into them and hits them in a way. Like only a [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4701.04s)]
*  smaller player can get away with doing that to a bigger guy. And then it causes kind of the [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4706.160000000001s)]
*  melee. Like Giannis at that point was like, all right, he is one of those guys. I don't think he [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4709.92s)]
*  gets enough credit for like, when you piss him off, I'm not saying it's Jordan, but there's, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4713.92s)]
*  there's an alarm that goes off. Like once Giannis is pissed off in a game, so he's just going to [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4718.56s)]
*  have to get pissed off, I guess, four times in this can, can something happen to him enough where [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4723.360000000001s)]
*  it just becomes unstoppable? Because they are the better team. And I think the bucks are still [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4727.52s)]
*  searching for it. And you know, even with Kevin Porter getting, getting some better nights out of [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4732.320000000001s)]
*  it, like that's asking a lot of that. 40 plus minutes in that one game. Asking him to cover [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4737.84s)]
*  in a playoff rotation and like, Hey, don't have this fall apart. Cause there's other times I'd [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4743.6s)]
*  say a couple of weeks ago, I was like, what is doc doing? And clearly doc was like, I may need [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4748.24s)]
*  this dude and we know how talented he is. So he was letting him kind of run the show that Houston [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4752.5599999999995s)]
*  game comes to mind when he was just a disaster, but he's played better. But then I'm like, okay, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4757.12s)]
*  so the Pacers who I really like all their depth, I'm going to pick Milwaukee with them still trying [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4761.76s)]
*  to kind of figure this thing out on the fly. You know, in my favorite sports book ever breaks of [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4768.88s)]
*  the game, which is about the trailblazer season, the 79 and 80 season and Bill Walton's gone and [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4773.28s)]
*  Dr. Jack Ramsey is trying to figure out what the team's identity is and just can't figure it out. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4779.759999999999s)]
*  And then near the end of the season, they bring up this guy, Billy Ray Bates, who becomes like [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4784.639999999999s)]
*  one of the best characters in the book. And he's just like, basically this one-on-one ISO guy who [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4788.08s)]
*  doesn't play anything like the Dr. Jack style at all. He's, he's not like, you know, uh, I pass, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4793.12s)]
*  I cut. He's just like a one-on-one guy, but they're, they're starting to play better with them. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4799.6s)]
*  And Dr. Jack has this crisis of philosophy of, I, this guy, I don't know, he gives us the best [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4803.76s)]
*  chance to win. We just, let's start running plays for him. And he starts really playing them. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4810.240000000001s)]
*  I almost feel like that's the Porter thing with Doc, where he's just like, I, I'm out of moves. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4814.240000000001s)]
*  Like if this Porter thing doesn't work, we're fucked. This guy can create shots for himself [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4819.84s)]
*  and other people and he plays hard. And I guess we're going to have to use him. If Dame doesn't [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4824.400000000001s)]
*  come back because he, their best lineup has Porter in it now. So we'll see. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4829.44s)]
*  Yeah. Cause he is that good at getting wherever he wants on the floor and his athleticism and [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4835.36s)]
*  the finish and all that kind of stuff. But like, you know, is there a Lopez conversation on how [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4838.96s)]
*  that plays out? Is Kuzma going to play great in the first half? Just prints it enough shots. Um, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4843.919999999999s)]
*  you know, AJ Green's clearly going to get minutes because he's a major part of the rotation. It is [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4851.44s)]
*  funny though, like when you think about the Pacers and why you'd pick against them, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4856.0s)]
*  since the all-star break, they're eighth in defense, which feels like impossible. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4859.2s)]
*  Like that group's figuring it out defensively enough and Milwaukee's, um, yeah, 16th, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4863.36s)]
*  but they had a good record. I mean, they closed 19 to 10. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4869.52s)]
*  They're eighth in defense and first in stupid losses. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4871.84s)]
*  That would be the other case for Milwaukee. I think they need three honest games and then one [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4875.52s)]
*  game where Indiana does what they do, which is just to completely fuck up a winnable game [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4880.72s)]
*  and do two stupid things in the last minute and you can't believe they lost. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4885.76s)]
*  So it's that it, that's the recipe, I think. Um, but Yanis like, you know, I had Tatum third MVP [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4889.52s)]
*  all year and I don't know how you can put anybody ahead of Yanis. No, I think that's my point. These [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4896.88s)]
*  last four weeks, like Yanis has to be third. He's has to, and I love the Tatum year and we've talked [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4903.280000000001s)]
*  about it a million times. I just think he's been awesome. I think he's been awesome as a two way [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4909.360000000001s)]
*  guy as a rebounder. He's, I think he's fifth in points. He's top 20 in rebounds. He's top 20 in [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4913.92s)]
*  assists. It's like maybe fifth and threes. Like he's just, and he's guarded everybody in the league, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4919.92s)]
*  but the, what Yanis did the last four weeks, I think he has to be third. And then if you're [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4925.68s)]
*  putting him third, this will be a seventh straight first team all NBA. And during those seven years, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4930.24s)]
*  he's averaged 30, 12 and six. And this year he's averaging 30, 12 and seven. So this is like [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4936.88s)]
*  LeBron level consistency where people 50 years from now will be on whatever the version of [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4943.76s)]
*  basketball references. I'm sure it'll be some sort of AI tablet that you can just touch with your [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4948.8s)]
*  hand and it just comes out of the thin air. People will be looking at this like, Jesus Christ, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4954.24s)]
*  what about this Yanis guy? It's like the same way you look at Carl Malone seasons down and be like, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4960.08s)]
*  oh my God, he put up 29 and 10 for 12 years. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4963.92s)]
*  Well, this will be what this will be seven. To me, he should finish third in the MVP. And I even [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4969.280000000001s)]
*  feel bad, you know, putting them there because of how special he is, but whatever. I mean, we've got [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4974.64s)]
*  a great top of the MVP class this year, but it's going to be seven straight years of the top four [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4979.76s)]
*  finishing MVP. And you start putting that resume up against like the birds. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4983.76s)]
*  All timers. Yeah. Yeah. He's pretty near that vicinity now that Shaq came in and he's like, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4987.76s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he's going to be in that vicinity now that Shaq came Moses area [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=4997.2s)]
*  in the all time grouping. He's not there yet, but I think if he keeps going for a couple more years [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5003.04s)]
*  at this pace could happen. Did you land on Mitchell fifth for the MVP spot or do you have somebody [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5007.84s)]
*  else or are you still figuring it out? I'm still figuring it out. We still have what? Like four days? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5013.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still figuring out too. Because normally when on the Sunday pod, we would do a lot of our [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5017.76s)]
*  I'm glad we're new stuff. I was like, Oh no, are we doing this today? I have for defensive [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5023.120000000001s)]
*  to player of the year, I'm pretty sure I already know what I'm doing, but specifically on the [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5030.88s)]
*  defensive stuff, like I'm fine with all the other things, but defensive stuff, I want to be able to [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5034.56s)]
*  make the rounds and talk to enough people because I just don't want to miss anything. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5038.8s)]
*  I don't want to be sitting there and look at defensive box score and going, well, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5043.84s)]
*  this guy was better than this guy. If I gave you two of James Harden, Tyrese Halliburton, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5046.64s)]
*  and Zubats, and I can only have two spots for third team OMBA, though you're a modern [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5054.0s)]
*  OMBA voter where you just pick the best guys. You don't care about the facsimile of a fake team. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5061.04s)]
*  I don't know that that's true. I feel a bit like the college football playoff commissioner [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5071.84s)]
*  where I'm never going to give you an answer. I'm not going to talk about conferences being [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5075.84s)]
*  better than other conferences. I'm going to say that all of it's factored in this is important. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5079.4400000000005s)]
*  That's not not important. I have fundamental beliefs, but each year is a different field. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5083.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you that I'm prioritizing this all the time because [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5093.28s)]
*  one year may not matter as much. The standings thing, I know you guys do a couple of weeks ago [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5097.4400000000005s)]
*  and you didn't seem to like that very much. I never like being you guys. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5102.4s)]
*  I never take anything personally though. I don't know that's true. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5106.719999999999s)]
*  On the pot, I mean with you. No, but I was watching Zach, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5111.92s)]
*  right? Fired up to have him on the team and he was talking about his MVP vote. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5115.679999999999s)]
*  He was like, I've been SGA all season long and now I'm just starting to think, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5121.92s)]
*  like, how can I not vote for Jokic? This is what I brought to you last week. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5125.68s)]
*  I'm really struggling with this and I don't have a pick yet. I don't. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5132.160000000001s)]
*  You haven't decided who you're going to vote for. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5135.84s)]
*  It's like honestly 50-50 for me. I watch Jokic. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5138.080000000001s)]
*  But it's the standings, right? It's C, but it's the standings. I think there's times you maybe, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5141.92s)]
*  could it be the tiebreaker for an all NBA? I don't think that's necessarily wrong, but [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5148.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know, man. I'm not having a hard time with this one. I'm voting for Jokic. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5153.84s)]
*  Oh, you've officially decided. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5158.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. I decided a while ago and I wouldn't say anything's happened recently or I'm like, oh, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5160.48s)]
*  I'm wrong. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5165.44s)]
*  I went back through all the MVPs that bothered me over the years and over and over again. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5166.48s)]
*  Which one's number one? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5170.24s)]
*  Well, just over and over again, the standings driven ones [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5171.44s)]
*  are the ones where we get in the most trouble, where we don't just [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5175.599999999999s)]
*  divest ourselves completely and be like, who's actually the most valuable player? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5179.36s)]
*  The problem with the SGA candidacy, and he's been amazing and we've talked about, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5187.599999999999s)]
*  he's having one of the best guard offensive seasons in the history of basketball. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5192.0s)]
*  But if you gave Jokic SGA's two through 12, I'm pretty sure he would be able to win 65 to 70 games [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5197.12s)]
*  with the team that SGA has. And that's where it gets dicey. Now they're a top five team. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5206.08s)]
*  I never want to have an MVP unless it's a team that has a good record that it's least in the [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5211.5199999999995s)]
*  vicinity, right? They're one game away from being a three seed. They're one of the eight or nine [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5215.76s)]
*  best teams in the league. But when you see all the dysfunction they clearly had the whole year, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5220.32s)]
*  and over and over again, he would just, despite the odds, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5226.32s)]
*  would just keep it together. And it was amazing to watch. And it's going to be the first thing I [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5230.96s)]
*  remember about this season was watching him this year. So that to me, like that was one of my, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5235.2s)]
*  when I wrote my MVP column, it was like four things. What are you going to remember first [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5239.68s)]
*  when you remember this season? For me, it's what Jokic did with this fucked up Nuggets team [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5244.16s)]
*  that fired their coach with a week left. And he had like the greatest offensive season I've [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5248.639999999999s)]
*  seen since Jordan played. So it's like, I, I, that's what I'm struggling with. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5253.599999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm struggling with. Cause SJ has won 68 games and he was awesome. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5259.12s)]
*  So dysfunction boost, is that new? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5264.48s)]
*  Dysfunction? Well, yeah, it's like, what, like, was it even more dysfunctional than we could [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5267.36s)]
*  ever imagined? We, we heard, we knew all this shit, but I don't know what it's like to play [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5272.4s)]
*  in a basketball team where you have this much animosity behind the scenes. Like maybe it doesn't [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5276.879999999999s)]
*  matter as much as we think. I don't know. It would seem like it would matter some, and it seems like [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5281.599999999999s)]
*  they were really, really genuinely tired of Malone, which was a whole other issue beyond [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5287.52s)]
*  the whole, he's not communicating with the GM. He's spitefully playing people that the GM likes [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5292.400000000001s)]
*  or not playing like whatever the, all that other shit. But I, the fact that they almost got to 50 [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5297.76s)]
*  wins with how Murray looked the first two months, like it's kind of incredible in the West. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5303.360000000001s)]
*  They did. Today was 50 wins. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5307.360000000001s)]
*  50 wins with the season they had with all, with, we did that live show in Denver. When was that? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5309.360000000001s)]
*  Beginning of December. And we led with the whole thing about the, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5315.52s)]
*  Jamal Murray had had like eight awful weeks at that point. And we, that was like one of our [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5319.4400000000005s)]
*  lead things where we were like, let's have an honest conversation about this. He's never going [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5323.92s)]
*  to be the same. Next year, like Murray's lighten it up or whatever. Then the national broadcast [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5328.0s)]
*  be like, and he still never made an all-star game. You'd be like, okay, do you want to go through [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5332.8s)]
*  the years again? This is like the LeBron MVP thing. Yeah. Or the Kobe MVP thing is actually worse. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5336.56s)]
*  I think Yoko is just the best player in the world. I think his stats are close enough, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5344.88s)]
*  depending on which metrics you want to look at, if not superior to SGA's. And it'd be one thing if [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5349.280000000001s)]
*  they were a disastrous team on the season, but I didn't really have a hard time with it. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5354.72s)]
*  He's going to be the first thing I remember about the season. I've never seen, and that- [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5362.080000000001s)]
*  More so than Shireman, the way he's closed. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5366.8s)]
*  Well, that's been pretty good. That's been watching, watching some of the Joe Mas lineups. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5368.96s)]
*  Yeah. I was bummed that it's Clippers Nuggets because I have a vested interest in the Clippers [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5374.8s)]
*  advancing because I want to go to the games, right? But I love Yoko Hich and I want him to, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5380.240000000001s)]
*  I want to keep playing because I like watching him. So I've just never, the stuff that he did [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5385.6s)]
*  this season, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen somebody do more for their team. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5390.400000000001s)]
*  It's like, what the fuck else could he, he got every rebound. He led the offense up. He took all [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5395.200000000001s)]
*  of the shots in crunch time. Like he literally did everything. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5400.72s)]
*  Jalen Williams, do you think he was an NBA guy or no? Just in general. Is he good enough? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5406.88s)]
*  Not ready to answer that. He's certainly on the list. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5411.52s)]
*  Are you? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5416.08s)]
*  I have him tentatively in there right now because I think with the season OKC had [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5419.04s)]
*  and the season Cleveland had, I find it hard to believe you can't get too, as you know, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5424.320000000001s)]
*  I gravitate a little bit more toward the record, especially with those late teams. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5428.4s)]
*  And I'm between Dort and Mobley for a defensive player of the year now. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5433.599999999999s)]
*  I haven't decided either, but those are my two finalists. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5437.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kind of leaning Dort. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5443.44s)]
*  It's another one of those. I can only judge what I've watched on TV [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5446.5599999999995s)]
*  and what I've seen in person. And I just thought he was the guy that jumped out to me this year. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5450.96s)]
*  Daniel's a little bit too, but I think some of the stuff Daniel's did just because it was so [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5455.28s)]
*  unique just to watch somebody poke check somebody from 45th of the basket. I literally haven't seen [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5458.719999999999s)]
*  that. His hands were everywhere. His anticipation. It was awesome. But that just wasn't a good enough [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5463.84s)]
*  defensive team. So you basically have to be one Banyama at that point. The thing with Dort is [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5469.28s)]
*  it's just like it's like old school pickup basketball. Like who's their best guy? It's [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5473.92s)]
*  that guy. Lou, you're going to defend him. Don't let him score. And then the guy doesn't score. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5478.5599999999995s)]
*  Just refuse to be screened. I normally always am going to just, I just think it's hard to [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5483.84s)]
*  have a perimeter guy and say this perimeter guy's as valuable as this other guy is. It's a big, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5490.72s)]
*  who's coming over to help at the rim in the times where Mobley could switch out of the perimeter [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5495.92s)]
*  guy and he holds up really well. So I've kind of struggled with the Dort-Mobley thing, but I will [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5500.16s)]
*  tell you again, defensively on these awards, I like to talk to people because it's just the one [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5505.44s)]
*  you don't want to miss. And it's a hard award to feel like, okay, I've absolutely nailed this, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5511.92s)]
*  especially when you do the first and second team. And the Draymond push has been incredible. And I [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5517.6s)]
*  don't want to act like you're dismissing Draymond, but sometimes there can be this push where you're [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5523.2s)]
*  like, you know, this is a six month award. Like let's remember that. And Mobley to start the [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5528.8s)]
*  season, there's some numbers that tell you like his impact was far greater in the first half of [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5534.4s)]
*  the season, second half of the season. But back to the original, like asking people about [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5538.08s)]
*  defensive stuff, the number of times that people just kind of stop and take a breath when they talk [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5542.0s)]
*  about Lou Dort that are working in the league every night, it's like, you can't help but be [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5546.0s)]
*  impressionable. There was some, somebody wrote a piece about for two and a half straight months, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5552.48s)]
*  nobody scored 30 on them. And it was, I also think, and we talked about this when Marcus won [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5557.36s)]
*  Defensive Player of the Year two years ago, which, you know, I forget who he beat. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5563.76s)]
*  I think the perimeter defender is more important than it used to be for stuff like this, just [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5569.6s)]
*  because all of these teams have these awesome guys that you at least have to make work. And [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5574.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I just, what he did to Jaylen Brown in that Boston game was just nuts. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5580.8s)]
*  But I watched them, like when they played, I went to two OKC games at both times hard and was like, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5585.4400000000005s)]
*  fuck, you could just see him. He's like, Jesus Christ. And then if Dort comes out of the game, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5590.8s)]
*  I have these other two. So the smart one felt like a campaign though, too. Like he just, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5595.2s)]
*  he did all these interviews where he kept just going, oh, you know, we never get to win it or, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5600.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, right. Well, they were number one in defense. There were some good advanced metrics, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5604.320000000001s)]
*  but yeah, it's looking back, maybe not. I don't know. I'd argue Rob Williams, although you could [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5608.0s)]
*  then go, okay, but Rob got to do what he did because he was on somebody in the corner who [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5612.56s)]
*  primarily it would be hopefully a non shooter so then he could just roam and freelance the entire [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5616.16s)]
*  time. So the perimeter guys usually, it takes so much more for me to go into them. And by the way, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5621.2s)]
*  he actually beat another perimeter guy that year because Bridges was in second, Colbert was third. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5627.5199999999995s)]
*  East quickly. We talked about Bucks Pacers, Knicks Pistons, Knicks are minus 460. We've been dying [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5633.36s)]
*  for this series. I think there's going to be, as it gets closer, some Pistons upset buzz. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5639.2s)]
*  I think it's a really hard ask if the five Knicks guys are all playing together. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5646.4s)]
*  I was talking to a Knicks fan about this. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5651.2s)]
*  If you catch them on a night when one or two of those five guys aren't playing, they look, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5655.36s)]
*  you know, incredibly vulnerable with reason because they don't really have a bench. But those five [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5660.08s)]
*  guys together with breaks between the games and all the guys, they can throw a Kade. This just seems [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5664.08s)]
*  like a tall ask for them to, and I think that's why the line reflects it. I really want to talk [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5671.36s)]
*  myself into a Pistons upset case, but I think just the fact that they made the playoffs, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5676.24s)]
*  they're a sixth seed. They had the year they had Kade established himself as a guy. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5681.12s)]
*  Durin has been, you know, I think he's now one of the best young centers in the league. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5685.5199999999995s)]
*  Some of their signings are really smart. That's kind of a win in itself. Now they're going to go [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5690.08s)]
*  in this series. They'll bang the Knicks around. There'll be a couple of altercations. They'll [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5694.96s)]
*  make a name for themselves and that's probably the win. If those five guys are healthy in the [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5699.44s)]
*  Knicks, I just don't see any way to trapeze them. Since the All-Star break and granted, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5704.08s)]
*  the numbers are a little weird for the Knicks, but who do you think's better defensively? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5709.12s)]
*  I would bet the ratings better for Denver. Cause I mean, at Detroit, cause all the advanced metrics [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5712.799999999999s)]
*  are, have been favorable for them last 30 games. Since the All-Star break, the Knicks are 11th on [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5717.36s)]
*  defense. The Pistons are 15. So, and by the way, points wise, it's a half a point. So it's not like [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5722.8s)]
*  some dramatic difference here. Now, is that because Brunson was missing some of those games? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5730.0s)]
*  Is there something there as opposed to, no, we have Mitchell Robinson back, but I'm with you. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5736.400000000001s)]
*  This feels a bit like, Hey, you're going to get a little playoff seasoning Detroit. This is an [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5740.320000000001s)]
*  incredible story, but are you really going to beat the Knicks despite their flaws and the flaws that [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5744.72s)]
*  we would get into as they move a little bit further on? Cause that's why like the Pacers-Knicks [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5753.280000000001s)]
*  scenarios where you were like, if they end up facing each other. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5758.0s)]
*  That was bad for the Knicks. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5763.52s)]
*  Yeah. Cause it kind of felt like- [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5765.92s)]
*  Not a good series for them. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5767.68s)]
*  There were some similarities where you didn't like your point guard on defense. You didn't like your [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5768.8s)]
*  center on defense, but you liked some of your options around it. But that might be the problem. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5772.16s)]
*  Like we've talked about this before. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5777.5199999999995s)]
*  That's not a fun series for towns. That would not be my ideal towns matchup. The Pacers wouldn't [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5778.08s)]
*  enjoy that one. The thing with the Pistons that I think is just really cool is the Bicker staff [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5783.92s)]
*  leaves the Cavs, right? The Cavs, when they end up with 64 wins and Atkinson is a coach of the [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5795.04s)]
*  year candidate and Bicker staff goes to this other team and turns them around. And so you look at the [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5803.28s)]
*  Atkinson piece and you go, well, clearly he's a big improvement over Bicker staff. And yet Bicker staff [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5808.64s)]
*  was a huge improvement over the worst coach of the 21st century, Monty Williams. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5813.92s)]
*  And somehow it just all worked out for everybody. And so I guess I'm happy for Bicker staff because [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5818.0s)]
*  it would have been one of those things where you just look like a schmuck that this team just played [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5822.8s)]
*  way better when you left. But now he got this other thing out of it. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5827.04s)]
*  But is Cade the best player in the series? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5830.400000000001s)]
*  I think Brunson is. I would say Brunson. Brunson's awesome. Especially like in a [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5836.72s)]
*  playoff series where he's going to have breaks between games. Like Brunson's incredible. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5843.04s)]
*  I really, uh, when he made the 65 game limit, I test drove what he would look like in the first [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5847.2s)]
*  OMBA spot instead of, uh, Mitchell. And I couldn't get there, but I think he's been that special this [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5856.08s)]
*  year. Were you more tempted to go Brunson or Ant for Mitchell's spot? I test drove Ant as well. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5862.0s)]
*  And then I, I, I did a long drive around the lap with Curry. Um, but I think Curry's, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5868.16s)]
*  well, Curry's last week, I mean, that San Antonio loss was an abomination. They, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5875.04s)]
*  they lost the two biggest games they played all year where that San Antonio or losses were that [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5878.96s)]
*  San Antonio loss on the one today. Um, I think if they win those games and they're a three seat or [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5884.32s)]
*  a four seat, I think that's a more interesting conversation. He had it in his hands. If he was [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5889.92s)]
*  just awesome down the stretch, I think he could have pushed Mitchell, but I don't think the way [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5894.719999999999s)]
*  they ended. And by the way, that San Antonio loss is the loss of the year. That fucked up the [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5899.2s)]
*  playoff schedule nine ways. It fucked up everything. Cause Harrison Barnes had a revenge game [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5904.88s)]
*  and the Spurs with Chris Paul and Harrison Bart celebrated. Like they got to the final four, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5912.88s)]
*  like this is a team that's tanking. I'm sure warrior's fans, like, couldn't make a couple [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5917.44s)]
*  of those in game seven. Right. We had to take you out. Nine years ago. For Festus Azizli. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5922.48s)]
*  Um, playing stuff quickly. Who do you think the calves would want to face the most out of [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5929.2s)]
*  magic bulls heat? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5936.32s)]
*  You're leaving the Hawks out. Oh, and the Hawks. All right. All four of those magic cocks bulls [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5944.24s)]
*  heat. The Hawks are pretty grim. If you look at their actual teams, they beat in the last two [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5950.32s)]
*  months versus the teams they've lost to where it's one of those we're not tanking. And a lot [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5955.12s)]
*  of these other teams we're playing are, and we're getting some wins out of it, but the, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5960.48s)]
*  the numbers are pretty grim. If you actually look at it, I think that's why the magic are [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5964.32s)]
*  five point favorites in the playing game. Yeah. The records, I mean, they're both around 500, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5967.44s)]
*  but Atlanta's defense is so bad that I think it's just, you know, if you're going up against [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5974.88s)]
*  somebody in the playoffs, you'd probably rather have a terrible, terrible defense. Just knowing [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5980.96s)]
*  that this is going to be easy work, even in the night where we're not feeling it or not making [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5986.64s)]
*  threes. Like are we actually going to be scared of anything as opposed to Orlando, who we know [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5990.24s)]
*  their offense at times has been unwatchable and it's improved from unwatchable the last few weeks, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=5994.8s)]
*  but it's, it's a one, two punch of, of Palo and France. So, you know, and I think you could look [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6001.52s)]
*  at some of the Miami stuff, but it's just Miami's at best a very average basketball team. So [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6008.0s)]
*  can I do a cousin of you guys? Yeah. People forget. Yeah. Bagely insulting when you start [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6014.24s)]
*  the people forget. But in this case, I do think people have forgotten how big the Jalen Johnson [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6021.92s)]
*  injury was. That might be the number one people forget. Like Jalen Johnson was playing awesome. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6027.6s)]
*  And if Atlanta had Jalen Johnson with the team that they have, the rest of the guys that I kind [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6034.0s)]
*  of like some of the guys in that team. And I don't even think that Hunter trade, the guys that got [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6039.28s)]
*  back from those, those guys are playing for them. If they had Jalen Johnson, this would be a lot [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6043.52s)]
*  more interesting as a kind of a frisky eight seed that might be able to steal a game or two. But [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6048.96s)]
*  when he was still playing, I was tracking touches, just how many touches do you have? So it's pretty [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6054.64s)]
*  clear. Yocic has more, he touches the basketball more times in a basketball game than any other [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6059.6s)]
*  player in the league. And Trey is usually right around there. If not other years where he's led [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6063.92s)]
*  the league in total touches over the course of the entire season. During the time Jalen Johnson was [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6069.52s)]
*  playing, he'd be like third or fourth in the NBA. That's how important he was and how much they [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6075.12s)]
*  trusted him. And thinking, think about that too, playing off of Trey and having another guy that [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6078.88s)]
*  actually has that many touches. And he looks like he's on the way to, you know, I don't know if he's [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6084.16s)]
*  like a superstar, changes the face of the franchise kind of thing, but he was really special and a [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6089.68s)]
*  lot of fun to watch. So you're right. Like look, every summer we'll do it again next year. We do [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6094.320000000001s)]
*  the over-unders and we're like, you know what roster I do kind of like, despite some of the obvious [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6099.360000000001s)]
*  concerns? It's Atlanta. So pencil me in for like another year of doing that. I think that was the [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6104.400000000001s)]
*  second biggest injury of the year in terms of the actual playoff stuff other than Kyrie, which [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6110.64s)]
*  if the Mavs had Kyrie, that's the team that they have. It's at least a team that, you know, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6118.400000000001s)]
*  you'd have to throw a couple of haymakers against. Now it's like without him. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6129.200000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. I think you're right about that. But I have Jalen Johnson second though. I even [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6132.16s)]
*  ahead of Wemby. Like if San Antonio, Wemby, I don't feel like, oh, watch out. San Antonio could maybe [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6136.64s)]
*  beat, steal a couple of games from anyone in round one, but Atlanta. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6142.96s)]
*  Don't you think, look, San Antonio, they could be five better, five games better, right? They were [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6147.12s)]
*  five out of the 10 spot. Yeah. I just felt like their supporting cast felt like it was a year away. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6153.36s)]
*  Next year. Yeah. That's next year. It'd be pretty interesting. You know, it also would have been [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6159.12s)]
*  interesting if the Mavs had gotten Austin Reeds and the Luca trade, which they should have just [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6163.2s)]
*  asked for. Or if San Antonio would have offered a contract. That would, that could have happened too. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6167.2s)]
*  I just, I was talking about somebody about that this week. Like how does Dallas not say, look, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6173.28s)]
*  Reeves has to be in the deal or it's not happening. I just don't think Polika, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6179.76s)]
*  we'll talk about this for the rest of our lives. I just don't think Polika is like [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6184.400000000001s)]
*  too much. I'm walking away. No, no, you talk about this too far. There's no way he doesn't say fine. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6188.0s)]
*  Take Reeves. It's my favorite part. Like forget about what it would be like lining up a putt to [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6194.0s)]
*  win the Masters on 18. Like how would you handle that? I do like, I like to take ourselves through [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6198.24s)]
*  the exercise of if this person calls you and offers you this, will you have the balls to say no to [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6205.12s)]
*  something that you desperately want? Knowing that, okay, this fixes for all of like this Lakers window [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6211.599999999999s)]
*  extending and you know, running in Denver in the last couple of playoffs, like, hey, if something [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6218.5599999999995s)]
*  bounces our way, like this has actually been, I think a more successful run for the Lakers [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6223.36s)]
*  and they actually get credit for it. But because LeBron's on the team, they're held to maybe the [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6227.68s)]
*  standard, they're supposed to be a title contender. So then they're brought up as a title contender [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6231.76s)]
*  on TV shows and you and I have talked about it. We're like going into this year, they're like, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6234.72s)]
*  look, they're probably not going to have the same health luck that they had with AD and LeBron [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6238.320000000001s)]
*  the year prior. If they're healthy in the playoffs, they get the right matchup, maybe. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6242.56s)]
*  But this is a team that won a title, what, half a decade ago and here we go. Like I don't know, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6247.280000000001s)]
*  I can't figure them out. Like, I don't know if I should be picking them because I can't imagine [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6254.16s)]
*  that they would beat OKC in a seven game series if they're lucky enough to get that far. Okay. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6258.8s)]
*  But looking at, and that would be in the Western Conference Finals, looking at that moment where [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6263.36s)]
*  you're Nico and you go, well, I have to ask for more because Palenka can't actually say, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6270.96s)]
*  like Palenka would never bring it up. Maybe like, you know, I was this close to getting Luca, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6277.2s)]
*  but I wouldn't include Reeves. And you would just go, Luca solves the next five years of your [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6281.44s)]
*  what if post LeBron. Next 15 years. Let's call it seven. Let's call it 12. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6287.919999999999s)]
*  To get worked that bad. It's still, it's been two months since the trade and I still, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6296.639999999999s)]
*  I did a monologue on it the other day and I still felt like it was somewhat relevant, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6301.2s)]
*  great, because it was his first time coming back and he has 31 in the first half. But [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6304.24s)]
*  like it, it's so bad that I don't think they can fire him because they all acted like they were [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6308.8s)]
*  all on the same page and they're going to have to like ride it out. Where was the one guy, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6314.72s)]
*  whether it was Dumont or anybody else, it was just like, hold on. We're trading Luca. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6321.04s)]
*  We're not going to get Reeves. It's not Davis. Like we're just making the Lakers [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6328.64s)]
*  like much better. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6335.84s)]
*  Imagine if Nico says, well, then they would have said no. And we're like, oh no. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6338.4s)]
*  Sounds great. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6344.88s)]
*  I just can't, I can't believe it. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6347.44s)]
*  Can you hate your own, like the one guy that had the say in it thought the least of the asset [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6348.24s)]
*  in the entire basketball world. The one guy that exists, right? Because there's always like one guy [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6354.48s)]
*  who's like, oh, he's not that good. I think Skip tried, Skip Bayless tried to have a LeBron [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6359.44s)]
*  Rory tweet or something, or it didn't, I don't know. It was basically just a new way to shit on [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6366.16s)]
*  LeBron. And interesting. Yeah. I was like, cool tricep pulldown. He was in the lab, bro. Yeah. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6370.719999999999s)]
*  He was in the lab just baking them. So there's always one person that will find a way to say [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6376.4s)]
*  the thing that like, you can't fucking believe somebody believes. And this, the one person [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6381.04s)]
*  happened to be the guy who was running the Dallas Mavericks when it came to Luca. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6387.68s)]
*  So I got more Intel on that trade. It was a known thing 90 minutes before the trade. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6392.72s)]
*  It was done 90 minutes before it was actually announced. Maybe even a little more than that. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6402.08s)]
*  Okay. But that's not unusual. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6406.4800000000005s)]
*  But they tried to make it seem like nobody knew until the very last second. I think way more [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6408.56s)]
*  people knew. And I think it got around the league a little bit before it actually got reported. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6415.44s)]
*  And I think the consensus was there's no way this is true because that can't be what Dallas got for [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6423.12s)]
*  Luca. This has to be some sort of, there's no way this can't be true. And then it was true [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6429.919999999999s)]
*  because the instant reaction is, wait, they're trading Luca. Why didn't they shop them? And then [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6437.599999999999s)]
*  the second one is, wait, Reeves isn't in this. That's the whole trade. That was the second thing. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6441.12s)]
*  And then how they hid it from everybody and didn't shop it, I guess, we'll be talking about [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6447.84s)]
*  forever. It's one of the seminal moments of the 21st century in the national basketball association. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6453.12s)]
*  The stupid trade they made. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6458.96s)]
*  I remember 2025 because you were able to be professional enough to go to YouTube live that [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6460.96s)]
*  night with me and Mahoney and do an hour of content knowing deep down for personal reasons [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6465.6s)]
*  how much you hate this fucking transaction. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6473.120000000001s)]
*  You know what's been interesting with the Laker fans? And I know a few of them. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6477.120000000001s)]
*  Even they're not talking crazy shit about it because they can't believe it happened. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6481.68s)]
*  They're like, where are the Lakers? They're just like, it's like that, like [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6486.240000000001s)]
*  a check for a million dollars made out to nobody just floated into their front door and they grabbed [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6492.24s)]
*  it and just wrote their name and cashed it. Nobody was ever going to find out. It's one of those. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6498.0s)]
*  It's like a fucking borderline miracle. If you're a Laker fan, you just can't believe it. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6502.4s)]
*  Like what did he have the other night? He just randomly had like 41, 13, 45, 13 and nine. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6506.8s)]
*  You're talking about the Mavs game? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6513.68s)]
*  Yeah. No, I'm talking about the last game he played. He played one more game, what? On Friday night? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6515.2s)]
*  On Friday night? He had another one. He's just like a normal game for him is 38, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6520.64s)]
*  nine. It just fucking kills me. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6526.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, the Houston game? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6528.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, he had 39. And it's even like- [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6529.200000000001s)]
*  Typical game. Yeah, look at 39. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6536.400000000001s)]
*  It was even worse than that Dallas game too because an AD is not doing anything. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6539.04s)]
*  He's like having the bad AD game because I always think it's so stupid when the guys are on TV [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6542.320000000001s)]
*  going like, Hey, AD is not a bad player. Like no shit. All of us have TVs. We know AD is really [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6546.72s)]
*  good. And he was awesome last year, but what are you talking about? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6555.52s)]
*  But the other piece of it is if the Lakers had the version of AD that's basically existed since [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6560.72s)]
*  mid January, they wouldn't be in the playoffs. They'd be like a nine or a 10 playing team, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6566.16s)]
*  right? Cause they wouldn't have had AD this whole time. They would have put this huge burden on [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6571.6s)]
*  LeBron. They would have the same lack of room protection they have now. It's really nuts. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6574.96s)]
*  That's also another thing in the Lakers conversation though, cause over that 18 and [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6582.64s)]
*  three stretch where their defense was first or second in the league, it was going for a month. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6586.4800000000005s)]
*  Cause when they added Luca, I think it was fair to also look at the perimeter defense going like, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6591.04s)]
*  okay, but how is this going to hold up on the perimeter? Are these guys, is Luca going to get [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6595.92s)]
*  hunted? I think Reeves does a good job of being in position. He's one of those guys that's smart, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6600.8s)]
*  but clearly there's going to be times if you get him deep enough, you can overpower him a little [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6605.12s)]
*  bit. And then night to night, like, look, I expect that we're going to see a more consistent effort. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6608.64s)]
*  Somebody that's willing to not just switch in advantages for him to rest himself with LeBron. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6613.12s)]
*  Like I imagine he's going to play with more intensity on that side of the basketball, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6616.96s)]
*  but the last 15, you know, whatever, you can throw it all away, but they're 21st in defense. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6620.16s)]
*  So when they were one of the three best defenses in the NBA for over a month after they had made [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6625.68s)]
*  the trade, I couldn't, we could talk about coaching. We're giving the staff all of this [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6629.92s)]
*  credit and like game in and game out. I think they prep, they adapt better. It's almost like [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6635.2s)]
*  a football team going into a Sunday being like, this is the game plan specific, which can get [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6638.96s)]
*  lost in NBA regular season. But I'm with like that felt it just like, there's no way they're this good. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6642.96s)]
*  They're not going to be a top five defense. Like, Hey, it starts with defense with that group. Maybe [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6650.64s)]
*  they outscore Minnesota, but, and it doesn't really matter what the scores were before, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6654.56s)]
*  but those are actually lower scoring games, but they had played so long ago. Again, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6658.48s)]
*  it's pre-Luca. So it doesn't really matter. It's going to be a bitch of a playoff team to play [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6662.32s)]
*  with how they execute offense, with how hard they are to officiate, especially when they're home. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6669.839999999999s)]
*  This is going to be really hard. And again, the whole point of Luca is when it all falls apart [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6675.36s)]
*  and you need a bucket, it's one 10, one 10 and you're under a minute and everybody knows [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6681.759999999999s)]
*  everything you're doing and it's game four and they're going to sell out. And it's just like, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6686.8s)]
*  I'm just going to score. And it's at its worst. Is it the second or third best thing in the [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6693.2s)]
*  entire league of like, Hey, I need a bucket. And we have playoff success to prove that that works [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6700.16s)]
*  as much as Boston grant random into the ground defensively and all that kind of stuff. Like [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6707.2s)]
*  you've traded this thing that is the most important thing to actually succeed in the [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6711.68s)]
*  playoffs, him with the ball deciding what he's going to do. It might be the best thing. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6718.08s)]
*  We've known this forever. Cause if you go back when we did our, or you weren't with us yet, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6722.64s)]
*  but we did the 2018 NBA draft stuff. And my argument for Luke over Aitin was like, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6726.96s)]
*  this is the league now. You have to have a guy like this. That's how you win titles. Unless, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6733.52s)]
*  nobody knew Yoko was going to turn into Yoko, but you need, it's a perimeter game. The threes are [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6738.4s)]
*  becoming more important. Like you have to have one of these guys. If you're going to try to win the [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6743.36s)]
*  title year after year and the Lakers have one of these guys, Yoko's might get you the best look. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6748.8s)]
*  Don't just probably get the best shot. Well, now that Yoko has mastered this thing he does where [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6753.36s)]
*  he basically, he's, I don't even know what we need a name for it. When he has the ball, 25 feet from [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6758.4s)]
*  the basket and he backs the guy down, does the whirling, does that thing. And then all of a sudden [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6764.96s)]
*  he's four feet from the basket. I don't know how he does it. And I don't know what it's called. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6770.08s)]
*  And I know how you stop it. The only way teams seem to stop it is they send a small guard [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6774.0s)]
*  and they try to kind of out of nowhere to his blind side and try to strip him. But he doesn't [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6778.16s)]
*  have blind side because he's doing this all the time. I have a couple of quick things. Oh, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6781.84s)]
*  and then okay. See first Grizzlies, Mavs Kings. Is there anything that says to you that would [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6787.04s)]
*  even go more than four games? Is there one team that could take a game off the thunder? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6792.56s)]
*  I don't think it's Dallas, man. When they had a lineup out there, it was one center lineup. And [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6797.68s)]
*  I think on the perimeter, it was Dinwiddie, Najee, Clay. And then I think PJ may have been playing [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6802.88s)]
*  power forward with the center and the amount of like resistance that wasn't happening on the [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6809.92s)]
*  perimeter defensively. And even PJ, who you think at least physically can hold up and stuff, he lost [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6814.88s)]
*  LeBron in one of those places. I'm just watching it going like, all right, even if AD and Kyrie [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6819.92s)]
*  were here, like they have some lineups or they'd have to maybe switch some guys out and just go, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6824.88s)]
*  we're going to have to hold up defensively here with some better options there. Memphis, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6828.56s)]
*  I know exactly what it's going to look like at the end of the playoff game. Maybe it'll go in. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6834.08s)]
*  Maybe it won't. Dallas gets a win because they don't have to play home again. If they, if they, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6837.36s)]
*  win two playing games, they're both on the road. And maybe during that second playing game, maybe [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6847.6s)]
*  you start thinking deep down in the deep recesses of your soul. Wouldn't mind the season ending. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6853.52s)]
*  We'll see what happens. I have a couple other storylines for you. Then we'll go. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6860.16s)]
*  Bub Carrington. Yeah. Carrying the Wizards to a win, knocking them out of the one spot. I was, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6864.08s)]
*  I was torturing house. I was, it was the funniest. So Utah has the number one spot. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6870.88s)]
*  Now the top three are Utah, Washington, Charlotte. They have 14%. Right. So it doesn't matter from an [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6877.28s)]
*  odd standpoint, but it does matter if you get jumped with the sequencing is it just brings you [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6884.24s)]
*  closer to having one of the top three and the Wiz. I don't know how it would have shook out if I [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6889.52s)]
*  think they were in the head spot ahead of Utah. Cause Utah won a couple of days ago. It comes [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6895.6s)]
*  down to Bub Carrington with four seconds left, beating two guys off the dribble and doing a double [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6900.48s)]
*  clutch fling off the backboard that goes in. And then he's mobbed and it felt a little Joe [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6905.28s)]
*  Milton into me. I gotta be honest with you. Little, little Joe Milton PTSD kicked in. It was like, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6910.48s)]
*  you know what that reminds me of when the pats had the number one pick that they would have been able [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6917.679999999999s)]
*  to trade for three first round picks. Cause everybody loves cam ward and instead we're [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6921.599999999999s)]
*  picking fourth in a three part draft. That's what I thought. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6924.96s)]
*  Yeah. That was a, that was a tough one for Pat's fans. Cause you're like, well, you know what? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6929.36s)]
*  That group competed and they can use that 25. You may remember we were supposed to lose. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6934.24s)]
*  We fought really hard. We can build on that. You're like, yep, we can build on it with less [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6938.88s)]
*  resources. Yeah. Just with less, two less first round picks. And now we're going to take a left [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6942.16s)]
*  tackle. Who should go ninth with the fourth pick? Question for you. Would you rather the sixers or [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6947.68s)]
*  spurs win the lottery? Spurs. Okay. I know last week we both agreed pretty quickly without any [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6953.6s)]
*  discussion that the sixers winning the lottery would be the grossest of all the outcomes. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6960.8s)]
*  It would be disgusting. Are the spurs a little? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6964.88s)]
*  No, because the Wimby thing was, oh, it seems like a legitimate medical thing by all accounts. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6970.160000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. I think Goldsberry has been pretty good on that. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6975.4400000000005s)]
*  So yeah, I'm, I'm, I feel like they've. 82 Chris. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6979.44s)]
*  Everything correctly. I liked that they beat Golden State in that game. Yeah. The Philly thing [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6984.879999999999s)]
*  would be gross. Did you see, oh, that was another thing I had on my list. Darrell said him and nurse [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6991.04s)]
*  are coming back next season. I got to say, I was genuinely surprised we're taping this right now. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=6995.44s)]
*  It's a little past six o'clock Sunday. So who knows Monday morning, we might wake up and that [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7000.32s)]
*  might not be true, but I was surprised to see that both guys feel like they're coming back. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7004.4s)]
*  You cool with that? Cool with that from what standpoint? [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7010.639999999999s)]
*  You think it's the right decision? [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7015.92s)]
*  I need more intel on who decided it was a good idea to let Joe OMB play in the Olympics and then [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7019.44s)]
*  give them a giant extension. Whoever's decision that was should probably pay some sort of consequence. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7023.599999999999s)]
*  It felt like it was turning on Darrell when the news came out. It was like, yeah, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7029.92s)]
*  ownership was really hesitant about giving Joel that deal. And you're like, oh, really? The guys [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7033.76s)]
*  who have to pay the 200 million were hesitant about doing it because that's. Next topic. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7038.160000000001s)]
*  I only have two more. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7043.92s)]
*  Mikhail Bridges kept his consecutive game streak alive. I don't know if he saw it today. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7045.6s)]
*  Checked in for six seconds and came out. Yeah. Committed a foul. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7049.6s)]
*  So AC Green did this when he, he broke his nose, came in with a mask for, I think three or four [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7053.92s)]
*  games and checked in and checked out to keep the streak going. I both don't care at all. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7059.44s)]
*  And I also really truly hate this. I hate it, but I also don't care. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7065.76s)]
*  I really hated it when AC Green did it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7073.68s)]
*  I forget who's when he broke. It was like, no, I don't care. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7077.68s)]
*  I forget who's when he broke. It was like Randy Smith, maybe the old Buffalo Brave. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7081.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, yeah, I think, I think that's who it was. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7086.959999999999s)]
*  Let me get research on that. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7089.919999999999s)]
*  I think Randy Smith played like 900 straight games. I think there was a time when. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7091.759999999999s)]
*  He played in the games. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7095.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think it was, it was, again, I was so much younger then, right? So it was 1996. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7097.44s)]
*  I remember, I think there was some high fives that he gave to guys as he came out, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7107.28s)]
*  like he had done something cool and that just really bothered me. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7111.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think it was Randy Green, 906. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7115.759999999999s)]
*  Randy Green? Were they related? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7119.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not Randy Green, Randy Smith. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7121.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7123.5199999999995s)]
*  Who, who beat your guy, Johnny Red Kerr. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7124.16s)]
*  Oh, that's my guy. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7127.12s)]
*  844. I know you're a big fan. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7128.16s)]
*  Randy Smith from Buffalo State. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7131.04s)]
*  Yeah. He was good. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7134.32s)]
*  He was a 14th round pick. Talk about a sleeper. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7135.5199999999995s)]
*  I think he was in the all-star game. It's an all-star. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7141.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Good basketball card. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7142.32s)]
*  He was 24th in the MVP voting. He has. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7145.04s)]
*  He has one of the cards of my favorite, my favorite card set of all time. The 1976 big boy tops. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7148.4s)]
*  Randy Smith's in there. Last thing for you. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7154.4s)]
*  Uh, last thing for you. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7158.16s)]
*  I just want to congratulate the NBA one more time for just fucking up their schedule. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7161.12s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7166.08s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7167.2s)]
*  You've been nice. You've been nice the whole pod. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7168.0s)]
*  So you have two games that matter today, right? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7170.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7172.96s)]
*  Two games that we know are going to matter. Houston, Denver, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7174.16s)]
*  Golden State Clippers, because Minnesota is obviously going to kill Utah. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7176.96s)]
*  Why not nudge those games by like two hours or 90 minutes, anything. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7180.4800000000005s)]
*  Your whole goal is to, for people who love basketball to watch the league that you have, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7185.68s)]
*  but then maybe also get some casual fans who are like, not sure how much I love basketball, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7190.96s)]
*  but that game was really awesome. And now I want to watch more or, Hey, maybe my, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7195.76s)]
*  my kid can come in and we'll watch the second half of this Clippers Warriors game. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7200.8s)]
*  That really means something. And instead you're just intentionally going at some masters that [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7203.92s)]
*  gets 10 to 14 million people and you get blown away in the last day of your season by this [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7208.64s)]
*  Warrior thing. And it's just like, it's just like a self-inflicted wound. I don't get it. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7213.36s)]
*  Either move the game two hours or move the schedule two weeks or I don't, I just, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7218.0s)]
*  they're the most stubborn fucking league. And I don't know why I love it. Sometimes really frustrates me. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7222.4s)]
*  Okay. Well, I think what they're doing with Saturday, trying to give everybody like equal [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7228.639999999999s)]
*  footing, right? Give everybody the day off, make sure it's not back to back seating. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7231.759999999999s)]
*  Stuff is really going to matter. Some years. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7235.28s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7236.719999999999s)]
*  This year was. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7238.08s)]
*  We had UFC and boxing last night. We were fine. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7238.639999999999s)]
*  And baseball. I'm back on baseball, but meaning to talk to you about it. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7241.68s)]
*  The TV game is so competitive right now. I mean, unless you just say, Hey, let's make sure we're [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7245.12s)]
*  never going to be going up against the masters for games 82. Okay. Does that mean you move it [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7250.8s)]
*  all to Monday? But you keep moving this stuff around the play in part of it. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7255.84s)]
*  Couldn't you nudge it two hours? Like what would Goodell do? Here's a good example. What would [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7259.2s)]
*  Goodell do in this situation? If he had the crown jewel of the Sunday slate turns out it's Clippers [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7262.72s)]
*  Warriors. Goodell would be like, fuck it. We're putting that on NBC eight o'clock on Sunday night [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7268.16s)]
*  and we're blowing this out and making this an event, which is what they should have done with [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7273.92s)]
*  Clippers Warriors. And instead they buried it at one o'clock in the afternoon PT. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7277.2s)]
*  Okay. But isn't the fear if you do that, right? Flex it out, NBA version of it. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7280.8s)]
*  That game could be totally pointless too, at some point, or do you make that decision just days [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7289.04s)]
*  ahead of time? No, you make it like 24 hours at a time. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7294.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. We knew yesterday, we knew what the most important game was. You and I were texting about [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7298.4s)]
*  it. It was like Clips Warriors. This is, this game matters. Not sure if Rockets Nuggets are going to [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7302.0s)]
*  matter. We know Clips Warriors is going to matter. So anyway, I just, the league that is in great [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7306.32s)]
*  shape and hit the jackpot with this Luka trade. It's the single best thing that happened to the [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7312.48s)]
*  league this decade and is in the running maybe since the decision in Lebron going to Miami and [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7317.12s)]
*  all the stuff they got from that as the biggest thing that happened in the league. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7325.68s)]
*  They have, they have this 25 year old incredible offensive player now on the single most important [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7331.04s)]
*  franchise in the league, at least from a popularity, you know, maybe second in a history standpoint, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7336.4800000000005s)]
*  but they hit the jackpot with this. So it's in a good spot. And now you have Steph Curry playing [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7342.8s)]
*  to try to not avoid the play in against a Clippers team. That's really fun to watch. Like, I don't [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7348.64s)]
*  know. I would have blown it out. I am watching baseball again, Rossella. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7352.88s)]
*  Yeah. You sent me a text about it today. Well, Crochet was throwing a no hitter that I didn't [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7357.4400000000005s)]
*  want to tell you he was throwing a no hitter because I was trying to obey the no hitter rules. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7361.28s)]
*  But, but yeah, Red Sox team, a lot of bats. Bats have been a little quiet so far, but, but [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7364.72s)]
*  likable team. I've been, I'm back five year hiatus. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7373.52s)]
*  They have the second most runs in the American league. Bats have been quiet. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7378.8s)]
*  Expect them more. They had a 19 run game. That's why the runs are where they were. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7382.96s)]
*  A lot of parity at the top of the American league, just like Jeff Passon told us flat. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7388.64s)]
*  All right. So you're doing your pot on Tuesday and Thursday this week. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7393.76s)]
*  Tuesday, Thursday. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7397.36s)]
*  For some reason, the playing games are Friday. I don't really understand why we didn't stagger [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7398.72s)]
*  those either and why we gave away Thursday night completely, but that's what they decided to do. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7402.32s)]
*  And, and then we'll be back Sunday with a whole, yeah, the most fun weekend of the year. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7406.96s)]
*  That first, the eight games overreactions left and right. I'll be, I'm just telling you now, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7415.679999999999s)]
*  I'm going to be overreacting all over the place. When are you doing your awards? Tuesday or Thursday? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7420.639999999999s)]
*  I could save it to unveil the ballot with you next Sunday. Why don't we do that? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7426.639999999999s)]
*  I think it's more fun. I think it's more fun. When does our stuff do? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7431.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's the 18th. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7436.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, all right. I'm happy to, I'm happy to do that with you. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7439.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we already had some revelations. I don't, I don't think people realize that [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7442.5599999999995s)]
*  Yocach has maybe a little bit better chance to win MVP than, than, than, than people realize. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7446.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think anybody's going to be surprised by what I've said, but yeah, you're right. Like [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7453.92s)]
*  that'd be something you'd be good at. Cause I feel like there's times I'll text Saruti about a topic [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7459.04s)]
*  for our Tuesday, Thursday. And then I go, you know, this would be better with bill, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7463.44s)]
*  like available belts, available belts. Podcast guest availability. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7466.879999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm talking NBA. Maybe belt availability would be the better [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7472.16s)]
*  way to title it, but you have to come up with something better. No, meaning like, I like when [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7477.759999999999s)]
*  you do which player has had the belt, right? The best player in the world. Yeah. When did he have [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7482.16s)]
*  it? Who got it next? How long did this player have it? How short was this guy's belt run? Okay. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7488.16s)]
*  So if you went through the entire league right now and say, all right, Yocach has the belt, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7494.24s)]
*  how many other players, like how long is the list of like, it doesn't seem crazy where you're going [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7498.8s)]
*  like, okay, that guy could at some point be the best player in the world. That list is not over [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7506.08s)]
*  10 players. I don't think. However, I'd also say that we have three recent belt holders [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7511.2s)]
*  that no one could have ever seen. Even if you were being incredibly generous between Janis [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7518.0s)]
*  Yocach, especially, and even Kawhi, there's like at one point that guy's going to be the best [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7523.04s)]
*  player in the world. And it's three in a pretty short amount of time. So we, we both worked those [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7527.92s)]
*  two drafts when Janis and Yocach got picked and uh, yeah. If the Yocach, I think had the lowest, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7534.48s)]
*  didn't you have the lowest jump in the history of the combine or something? [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7542.88s)]
*  Like a 17 inch vertical leap. I looked at my Yocach scattering report that I wrote up. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7546.160000000001s)]
*  When he got drafted. Right. I looked it up because I always like to go back and like, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7550.56s)]
*  we're like, what in the world? I thought of this guy, right? Sometimes it's fun. A lot of times [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7556.4800000000005s)]
*  it's horrifying, but it was, it was like, man, this guy's like a lot of fun. And then at the end, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7559.84s)]
*  it was like, but come on dude, like give me a break. Right. Yeah. So you think he's like Omar, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7566.240000000001s)]
*  what was that guy's name? Omar Samhan? That center that came in and was lightening up people, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7571.76s)]
*  March Madness. Well, the first time I would only be able to watch him on synergy. So I would just [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7577.2s)]
*  go back because he was on the list and because I was doing my own stuff, I didn't want to just [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7581.68s)]
*  read everybody else's stuff. And then I would do the draft on whatever. I don't even know if we [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7586.320000000001s)]
*  even talked about the second rounders when they're even picked because we'd interviewed so many [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7590.320000000001s)]
*  people on the live broadcast for radio, like radio back then when we did the draft, it was like [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7593.360000000001s)]
*  interview, interview, interview. I mean, you're listing the last five picks after the interview [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7597.68s)]
*  Nick Johnson got taken. Right. Like we're able to get Nicole Jokic from Serbia. So when you first [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7602.0s)]
*  watch Jokic, you're like, what is this? This is like, this is hilarious. Like I can't believe you [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7608.400000000001s)]
*  did this. I can't believe you did that. But then, you know, again, athletically, you're just like, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7614.0s)]
*  well, this was like, well, remember once upon a time there was a Jokic versus Nurkic, which [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7618.16s)]
*  guy should they keep was an actual storyline. That was probably 2017 range. They have these [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KVyO00BxY&t=7624.400000000001s)]
