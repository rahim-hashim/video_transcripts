# The Lakers Land Luka, Day 2: Predictions, Conspiracies & the LeBron Fit | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918)
*  All right, Kurt Goldsberry, you're sitting home on a Saturday night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=0.0s)]
*  Luka Donska just being traded to the Lakers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=3.44s)]
*  What's your immediate reaction? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=5.44s)]
*  Uh, like everybody else, this is hacked. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=7.32s)]
*  It's embarrassing for Shams. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=9.64s)]
*  I can't believe that the, uh, the hacker didn't come up with a realistic trade. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=11.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Uh, this, if the, if only the hacker had come up with a realistic trade, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=16.56s)]
*  this would have been a masterpiece. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=20.2s)]
*  Put Reeves in it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=21.48s)]
*  Put Reeves in the 2031 first and a swap. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=22.28s)]
*  And then I might think this happened. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Literally, that's my reaction. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Um, I think it says it all that everybody I know legitimately thought [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=30.24s)]
*  this was a hack and now are like digging into David Stern style conspiracy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  theories, trying to rationalize it afterwards. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=38.88s)]
*  So those are the two points. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=41.24s)]
*  When it happened, this guy got hacked after it happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=43.4s)]
*  This is a conspiracy theory. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=47.36s)]
*  What, what, what explains this in reality? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=49.0s)]
*  Shocked. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=52.96s)]
*  I mean, count me among the people, Bill, this is the biggest, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  craziest NBA trade of my life. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=57.84s)]
*  Uh, this I don't, I don't even think I was saying that last night to Rossella [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=60.04s)]
*  Mahoney, just we're reacting in the moment. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=63.8s)]
*  I had some time to sit with it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=66.52s)]
*  I'm like, this is definitely the craziest NBA trade. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=67.84s)]
*  There's never been anything like this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=70.16s)]
*  There's never been an inkling. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=71.88s)]
*  I'm going to walk you through. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=73.64s)]
*  I came up with the six levels of massive NBA trades, and I'm using mostly the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=74.68s)]
*  21st century trades as a litmus test. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Cause I was really trying to figure out, has there been a crazier trade than this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=85.68s)]
*  level one big deal, but we definitely had an inkling. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  So that's like I ever said to Denver, Carmella to the next, Chris Paul to the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=91.96s)]
*  Clippers, even Kevin Love to the calves. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  Big deal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=99.08s)]
*  But we knew we had a feeling and it wasn't like massive and we weren't going [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=99.56s)]
*  to be telling our grandkids where we heard the news, Kyrie to the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Boston, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  Level two, big deal immediately. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  One side and then stupid. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=110.24s)]
*  So it's a trade you maybe had an inkling, but then you see, and you're like, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=112.16s)]
*  wait, what, that's all they got. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=115.0s)]
*  So that's like Vince Carter to the Jersey, TMAC to the Rockets, Joe Johnson, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=117.04s)]
*  the Hawks, hearted to Houston is a great one for this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Go bear to the T wolves are like, wait, what, what happened? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  That's level two. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=127.76s)]
*  Level three is the big deal out of nowhere that you feel like something tilted. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  That's Jason Kidd for Stefan Marbury in 2001. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  It's like, Whoa, those guys might be the two best point guards in the league. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=137.8s)]
*  They just traded them for each other. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=141.96s)]
*  Uh, Gasol to the Lakers, Darren Williams to Utah, where he had a feeling. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=143.68s)]
*  Was it going great there? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=150.4s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're trading them for Derek favors and two [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=151.2s)]
*  firsts and it was like, Whoa, but then we move into this next level, level four. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=153.36s)]
*  The mega deal, but we knew something was coming. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=159.56s)]
*  So that's like Shaq to Miami. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=161.72s)]
*  That's KG to the Celtics. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=163.16s)]
*  That's Anthony Davis to the Lakers, pardon to the nets, Durant to the suns. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=164.52s)]
*  We had a feeling we knew, but it was still like, Holy shit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=170.16s)]
*  That's a monster trade. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=173.2s)]
*  Then you go to level five, the mega deal out of nowhere. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=175.04s)]
*  This is where it gets pretty rare. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=177.76s)]
*  That's Paul George to the Clippers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=179.72s)]
*  We know Kawhi's pick it back and forth between Lakers Clippers the whole week. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  We don't see the Paul George piece. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=187.32s)]
*  Now all of a sudden they're on the same team and they're trading [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Shade Jilgis Alexander, Danilo Gowinari, four firsts, two swaps, and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=192.12s)]
*  another protected pick and we're just like, what happened? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=197.56s)]
*  And I think that was the biggest shocking trade, at least a century until [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=200.44000000000003s)]
*  we get to level six last night. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  What the fuck just happened? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=205.84s)]
*  Did the reporter get hacked? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=207.0s)]
*  It's never happened before. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  This is the first, did the reporter get hacked mega trade? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  So you go backwards to the seventies eighties, like will to the Lakers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=214.52s)]
*  cream to the Lakers date every time we had a feeling, maybe somebody [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  that a guy was available, but you talk to a bunch of NBA teams. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=223.0s)]
*  Had you heard Luca was available? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  It was even conceivable. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=228.4s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=231.32s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=231.56s)]
*  I talked to people who were involved with this deal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=232.04s)]
*  I had no idea this was possible. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=234.04s)]
*  And I think you had them fourth in the trade value. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=237.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=240.2s)]
*  Generally when anybody's, I would like to do a historical analysis of what's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=240.56s)]
*  the highest person on that list that's ever been moved. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  Like, well, so a good way to somebody sent this to me that Bob McAdoo is the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  only real comparison we can ever do who was around the same age range. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=251.28s)]
*  He'd won the MVP twice all NBA guy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=255.44s)]
*  And it's the only one that's even in the ballpark of, from a talent [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=259.16s)]
*  resume standpoint already, but in that case, they were trying to save money [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=262.88s)]
*  and they basically sold them to the Knicks. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=266.96s)]
*  What about Kareem out of Milwaukee? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=269.4s)]
*  Like that reminds me of this too. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=271.48s)]
*  It's like Moses Malone, but that, but those, like, we knew those guys were [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=273.76s)]
*  getting traded, those guys were like, trade me or I'm going to do frailty. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=277.24s)]
*  Moses Malone signed with Philly and they had to then come up with a deal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=280.24s)]
*  So that's like the caliber of dudes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  Davis is another one in 2019 with the Lakers. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=286.28s)]
*  We knew that though. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=289.44s)]
*  Not like this where the guy didn't know he was getting traded. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=290.24s)]
*  This has never happened. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Nobody knew that this dude was on the market, which to me is the legacy of this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=295.32s)]
*  deal and it actually helps explain it now 24 hours later to me is that the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=300.2s)]
*  Dallas Mavericks valued Anthony Davis as much as Luka Doncic. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=306.0s)]
*  Say what, say what you want about that assessment, but that is the only [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=312.44s)]
*  justification or rationalization that explains how we got here right now, Bill, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=317.84s)]
*  because they only called one team, which you and Rosillo and Mahoney did a great [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  job of calling out that part of this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=329.12s)]
*  They really were zeroed in on getting Anthony Davis to their team. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=333.2s)]
*  And I disagree with that assessment. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=338.32s)]
*  I think most people around the NBA wildly disagree with the assessment, but [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=340.56s)]
*  that is the only explanation of how we got here today that the Nico Harrison [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=345.16s)]
*  looked at Anthony Davis and says, I want that as much as I want Luka Doncic. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=351.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=356.96s)]
*  People I've talked to reading stuff, hearing stuff. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=358.24s)]
*  It really seems like this starts in the finals last year when Boston kicks [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=363.32s)]
*  their ass and Lucas defense is a problem. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=366.96s)]
*  And I think kid was just like, we, we're never going to win the title unless this [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  guy takes a little more seriously on the other end and gets into better shape. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=379.48s)]
*  That's so that's something they're talking about internally all the time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=379.8s)]
*  Comes into this season, still not an awesome shape gets hurt, gets hurt again. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  And, um, you have Polinka and Nico Harrison who had this whole crazy long [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=389.12s)]
*  relationship together, like these were two, two of the guys that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=395.12s)]
*  Kobe was the closest to, so they've known each other like from the height of the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=398.88s)]
*  Kobe era and, uh, they just start talking and the reporting all said, they started [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=401.96s)]
*  talking in the beginning of January and they've been talking ever since. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=406.72s)]
*  And I think it's a masterful job by Polinka to convince Nico not to shop them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=410.12s)]
*  Now, if you're going to be fair to Nico, they're going to trade Luka. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=417.8s)]
*  They know what they wanted. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=421.68s)]
*  They wanted a big guy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=422.64s)]
*  There's no other big guy that they could have traded him for. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=423.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=426.12s)]
*  So if you're going to make calls, you're calling Milwaukee for Yanis and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=426.76s)]
*  you're calling Boston for Tatum. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=431.04s)]
*  So when people talk about how do you not shop them around, they feel like, like [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=432.8s)]
*  Nico said in the press conference, whether you agree with it or not, they felt like [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=436.12s)]
*  they have a team that has a chance to win the title. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=440.84s)]
*  They wanted to add somebody who could help them win the title this year. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=442.84s)]
*  So that rules out basically everyone in the league and brings you to Tatum and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=446.28s)]
*  Yanis and they didn't call Boston. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=449.56s)]
*  They didn't call Milwaukee. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=451.52s)]
*  Now, if they called Milwaukee and said, do you have any interest in trading for [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=452.92s)]
*  Yanis and Milwaukee or do you have an interest in trading Yanis? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=456.24s)]
*  And Milwaukee said, I mean, the only way we'd ever even consider doing that is if [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=460.32s)]
*  Luka was on the table and then Nico goes, well, hold on, what are you thinking? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=465.08s)]
*  And then you kind of stumble into it, but they didn't make the calls. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=470.16s)]
*  It's staggering. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=475.32s)]
*  That remains and will always be the staggering part of this transaction. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=476.44s)]
*  And I think when the dust settles, that's the biggest question that Nico Harris [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=481.32s)]
*  is going to have to answer to for years is sure. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=486.36s)]
*  You reach the conclusion internally. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=490.56s)]
*  Again, I'm not justifying this, but they reached the conclusion internally that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  we do not want to pay this person $350 million. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=497.24s)]
*  We don't think his calf is going to hold up. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=500.24s)]
*  We don't think his body's going to hold up. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=502.08s)]
*  We don't think his nutrition is good. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=503.52s)]
*  Whatever they reach the conclusion that they're out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=505.52s)]
*  That's part one. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=508.4s)]
*  Nico said, we felt like we were heading toward a tumultuous summer that we [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=509.12s)]
*  couldn't avoid. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=514.44s)]
*  So we're trying to get out of this now, which leads me to believe they, maybe [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  they were split internally and paying him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=519.84s)]
*  Or the ownership is involved. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  And I had one executive experience to me like this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=524.32s)]
*  The why is pretty clear. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  They didn't want to be in the business of Luka Donchich long-term. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=528.5200000000001s)]
*  They think he's more like Joellen Bede than the rest of us. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=531.48s)]
*  They think that this is a big long-term risk and they don't want that Joellen [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=534.72s)]
*  Bede Albatross contract hanging over their cap table for the next whatever, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  five, six years. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=545.6s)]
*  That's, but you reach that point. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=546.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think Ryan did a great job with this too. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=549.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=552.0s)]
*  Now what is the process? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=552.92s)]
*  The how is the problem. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=554.72s)]
*  We can disagree with the why, but the how they executed this is the problem. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=556.64s)]
*  You have a generational trade asset. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=562.72s)]
*  You have to canvas the league. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=566.48s)]
*  You have to cast the wide net. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=568.16s)]
*  You have to get two or three parties negotiating against each other to get the best deal. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=569.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=576.24s)]
*  You're trading Herschel Walker, dude. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=576.44s)]
*  You got to get the dynasty coming back to Dallas. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=578.52s)]
*  You got to get all those offensive line, all those Vikings pricks, uh, for those [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=582.36s)]
*  of us of a certain age, and they didn't do that, dude, that's going to be the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=587.2s)]
*  thing he has to answer to for the next few years. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  I was talking to my wife about it last night after we did the podcast. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=594.32s)]
*  And she was just like, I don't understand why they traded Luca. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  Wasn't it in the finals? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=600.36s)]
*  Like she knows nothing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=601.28s)]
*  She doesn't care. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=602.04s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, they just, uh, you know, they just felt like, I guess [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=603.28s)]
*  they didn't want to pay him. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=607.24s)]
*  I didn't, I still don't know anything. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=608.0s)]
*  And she, and she goes, well, did they, did they try to trade them in other teams? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=609.12s)]
*  Was that the best trade? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=613.0s)]
*  And I was like, no, they just had one team. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=614.76s)]
*  And she's like, that's weird, right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=616.64s)]
*  Like she, she was just like, try, I was trying to explain it to her. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=618.36s)]
*  Like she was like a little kid in elementary school. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=620.68s)]
*  It's like, yeah, usually, usually when you're shopping a guy, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=623.6s)]
*  tell the other teams. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=627.16s)]
*  And then one of the funniest things I got this morning was one of my friends was [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=628.56s)]
*  like, Dallas is the team in your fantasy league that they just trade and you [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=632.04s)]
*  fucking lose your mind and everyone's on email threads arguing about it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  Cause they can't believe they wasn't shopped. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's basically what Dallas did here. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  Couple of kickers though, with this, that makes me wonder if maybe the general [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  public has completely overrated the town in this trade or were, or these two [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  teams are just insane. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=653.4s)]
*  Dallas put in a second round pick. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=654.36s)]
*  So we're sitting there going, how is Max Christie in this [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  trade instead of Austin Reeves? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=661.92s)]
*  How is their 2031 first not in there? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=663.64s)]
*  Why wasn't there like three years of swaps? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=666.4s)]
*  And as Rosilla made the joke last night, which was great about Poincare, like [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=670.2s)]
*  holding firm on the 31 pick, like the deal was going to go away. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=674.04s)]
*  It was even crazier than that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  He's like, not on my own firm. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=679.88s)]
*  Give me a second round pick. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=681.5999999999999s)]
*  And he got it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=683.16s)]
*  So that's how bad the Mavs, a wanted to get rid of Luca, I guess, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=684.04s)]
*  and B wanted Anthony Davis. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=688.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=690.64s)]
*  And there's a week long process. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=691.2399999999999s)]
*  One of my sources inside the Lakers was indicating that the deal was bigger. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=693.0s)]
*  And I think you guys were literally joking about this last night that there [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=699.04s)]
*  were two firsts and there was Dalton connect and the deal got whittled down. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=703.2399999999999s)]
*  Because I think Rob Polinka was able to convince the Dallas Mavericks that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  Luca is a lot of risk. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=713.2s)]
*  You guys are right for trying to look at this this way, because this guy, oh, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=715.2s)]
*  he's drinking or whatever is weight problem, whatever it is. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=719.36s)]
*  So they were able to convince it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=723.84s)]
*  This was a week's long process. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=725.5200000000001s)]
*  That's another thing that came out today is this wasn't, this was a, and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=727.36s)]
*  Dallas started three and a half weeks. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=731.32s)]
*  Dallas started three and a half weeks. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=734.08s)]
*  Dallas started it, dude. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=736.28s)]
*  This is, this fell in Rob Polinka's lap. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=738.6s)]
*  And then he was able to reduce the outward Lakers assets to such, dude, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=742.6s)]
*  Mikhail Bridges commanded five first round picks. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=749.68s)]
*  Well, so the thing with Polinka, he is, I've just been marveling at, um, he's [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=753.88s)]
*  like a, it's like a character out of a succession or something. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=759.76s)]
*  He is over and over again, figured out how to blame whoever was coaching the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=764.12s)]
*  Lakers for whatever was wrong with them over any of his moves, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  The Westbrook trade, like you could point all these different things at Polinka, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=771.2800000000001s)]
*  but he always survives. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=774.48s)]
*  And then he somehow Jedi mind tricks, Nico Harrison with this Davis thing and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=776.1600000000001s)]
*  talks to him for three weeks, convinces him not to shop them anywhere else. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  No, no, if you're going to trade Luca, like it has to be for Davis. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=784.6s)]
*  Who else in the league would it be? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=788.0400000000001s)]
*  You have to get an all defensive center back. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=789.0s)]
*  Like you're going to shop them like Milwaukee. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  Luca's not going to go to Milwaukee. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=793.0799999999999s)]
*  Like Milwaukee is not going to trade Yanis for him because. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=794.52s)]
*  Luca's never going to sign there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=797.48s)]
*  They know that Boston loves Tatum. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=798.64s)]
*  They're not turning Tatum into Luca. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=800.24s)]
*  They love Tatum. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  That's their guy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=802.92s)]
*  Like, so now it's like bam out of bio. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=803.6s)]
*  Like you can't trade Luca for bam out of bio. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=806.12s)]
*  It's gotta be Anthony Davis. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=808.56s)]
*  So he's just like, like kind of tilting it so that Nico's like, yeah, you're right. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=809.6s)]
*  I guess you guys are the only suitor and it worked. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=814.8s)]
*  The other thing is they think this team is going to win. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=817.24s)]
*  They think that the Kyrie, uh, clay Thompson, Anthony Davis trio is a big three. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=820.2800000000001s)]
*  They think that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=827.0s)]
*  Well, that's stupid. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=827.88s)]
*  They don't, they can't think that they think they're going to win. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=828.6s)]
*  Otherwise they wouldn't have done it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=831.5600000000001s)]
*  But I think the only way again, that you can explain why they would only call [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  the Lakers is they wanted Anthony Davis. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=836.5200000000001s)]
*  They started off this process. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=839.1600000000001s)]
*  Hey, we think we can get Anthony Davis and Nico has a great team. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=841.12s)]
*  Hey, we think we can get Anthony Davis and Nico has this preexisting relationship [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=844.32s)]
*  with Anthony Davis and Jason kid has this preexisting relationship with [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=849.1600000000001s)]
*  Anthony Davis in the Lakers. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=853.44s)]
*  And again, I don't agree with these things, but I like everybody spent the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  whole day trying to understand how this could have gone and how they [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  only called one organization. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=865.4000000000001s)]
*  And it's almost like they want a tough defensive team, right? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=867.5200000000001s)]
*  So they're thinking we can run our offense through Kyrie and AD. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  We have a bunch of shooters and tough defenders and we could actually hang in [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=873.8000000000001s)]
*  the West in a real way. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=878.48s)]
*  If those two guys are healthy, they might, they might not necessarily be wrong, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=879.5200000000001s)]
*  but it doesn't mean they shouldn't trade in Luke. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=883.44s)]
*  I think they're going to be pretty good this year. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=886.36s)]
*  I'm not going to say this is a disaster. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=888.2s)]
*  No, they're going to have real size with the two centers and Davis. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=890.88s)]
*  They have wings that can play D. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=894.4000000000001s)]
*  They have Kyrie who's a crunch time guy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=896.6400000000001s)]
*  This is a pretty big offensive burden for him, but I can see how you talk to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=898.72s)]
*  yourself into this, except for the part that you're giving up a generational [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=902.24s)]
*  talent who's having one of the first seven years of his career. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=904.92s)]
*  There's only four other guys in the history of the league. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=908.48s)]
*  Will LeBron, who the other two, will LeBron, uh, Kareem magic. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=910.6s)]
*  No, there's one other one, but anyway, that are on this. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=918.8s)]
*  Oh, Oscar Robertson that have the first seven years that Luca had in the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=921.92s)]
*  history of the league. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=926.04s)]
*  We're talking almost 80 years. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=926.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=928.4s)]
*  Stefan Curry hasn't made first team all NBA as much as Luke has. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=931.72s)]
*  Stefan Curry took him three years to even become Stefan Curry, right? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=932.2s)]
*  Luca immediately. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  And he made Western finals and finals. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=936.44s)]
*  So I'm going to run through a couple of things. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=938.6s)]
*  I'm going to throw you just from, from, uh, reading, listening, talking to people, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=941.24s)]
*  one, a couple of the narratives that didn't pass the sniff test for me or just [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=949.0s)]
*  things that I didn't hate yesterday. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=952.72s)]
*  I want to the first one, the AD and LeBron and clutch being blindsided by this trade. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=954.24s)]
*  Having no idea that it was in the works, finding out like we all did after the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=961.0799999999999s)]
*  fact, as you know, I'm a, I'm a conspiracy guy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=965.72s)]
*  I'm a sniff test guy. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=970.36s)]
*  This does not pass the sniff test for me for this reason. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=972.36s)]
*  Buried in all of this stuff was Anthony Davis waved his trade [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=975.8s)]
*  kicker to go to Dallas. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=980.88s)]
*  And he did it pretty quickly. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=981.28s)]
*  So you have Anthony Davis blindsided by the trade who loves Los Angeles, who's [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=984.64s)]
*  in his little clutch triangle with LeBron and Rich Paul and out of nowhere [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=989.56s)]
*  gets traded to Dallas. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=995.8s)]
*  And he's so upset about it that he decides to forgo $5.9 million and wave [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=997.88s)]
*  his trade kicker money he's entitled to. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1004.1199999999999s)]
*  And he's like, I'm good. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1007.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1008.52s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1008.88s)]
*  I want to help you guys out. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1009.3199999999999s)]
*  It just doesn't pass the sniff test for me. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1011.0s)]
*  LeBron James, same thing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1013.1199999999999s)]
*  LeBron, you would think he took, would take this so personally. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1014.3599999999999s)]
*  You trade my guy. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1017.4s)]
*  This is my hand pointed sidekick. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1018.6s)]
*  You got to trade me now quietly today. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1021.36s)]
*  It's like, nah, he's going to be here after the trade deadline. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1024.24s)]
*  And then clutch, same thing. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1027.2s)]
*  Shams has a relationship with clutch. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1028.52s)]
*  Shams gets the scoop. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1031.08s)]
*  I just think they knew before the trade and I, I, I wouldn't bet my life on it, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1032.4s)]
*  but that would be my bet. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1037.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1039.4s)]
*  I think the idea that this traveled in silence the whole time. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1039.6s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1045.32s)]
*  A lot. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1045.88s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1046.4s)]
*  Now that we know it's been since January 7th, it's absurd. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1047.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1051.64s)]
*  That's what I learned today too, is that this was a month long process. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1052.0400000000002s)]
*  And the idea that, that this was as quiet as it is hard to believe, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1055.64s)]
*  particularly the way that clutch and LeBron have inserted themselves [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1060.96s)]
*  into Lakers basketball operations. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1064.64s)]
*  Um, and, and I agree with you that the idea that, that Anthony was [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1066.96s)]
*  so quick to wave that thing. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1070.92s)]
*  Um, and that's kind of fired up to go to Dallas, which [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1072.8400000000001s)]
*  this is why I wanted to do a second day pod raises a bunch of questions for me. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1077.16s)]
*  It's like, you seem pretty pumped about this. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1081.48s)]
*  You're not sticking them with the trade kicker and you seem like you like where [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  you're going and you have this long relationship with Nico Harrison and [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1089.72s)]
*  you're getting away from the Lakers. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1093.5600000000002s)]
*  And maybe you feel like you're selling high and your Laker experience. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1094.96s)]
*  You want a title, LeBron's 40 years old. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1098.0s)]
*  Eh, new challenge Dallas. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1101.3200000000002s)]
*  Maybe I'll be the guy there in Texas. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1103.2s)]
*  Just seems like if he, if he was pissed about it, you're making [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1105.76s)]
*  them pay the 5.9 and he didn't. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1109.2399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1111.84s)]
*  Uh, it's also a big compliment. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1113.28s)]
*  I think one of y'all said this last night that he is the piece for Luka [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1114.9199999999998s)]
*  Dacic and I think that's almost flattering to a point, uh, right. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1119.4799999999998s)]
*  That they had to throw in a second round pick from Dallas aside [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1123.4799999999998s)]
*  just to get this done. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1126.4799999999998s)]
*  And there's some intel that, that Anthony was not in love with playing in Los [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1128.12s)]
*  Angeles, the way they were playing basketball. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it all comes together that he might have been, he might not have [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1134.4s)]
*  been as satisfied there as he was letting on. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1138.44s)]
*  And then if LeBron was truly blindsided by this, just from his, let's say some [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1141.6000000000001s)]
*  passive aggressive behavior over the years from him with roster moves and lack [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1147.68s)]
*  of moves, and he just seems pretty fine with the events, at least so far it's [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  6 30 now, uh, on a Sunday night. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1155.8000000000002s)]
*  We haven't seen him really like leak anything, say anything and just seems [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1158.72s)]
*  okay because he's smart because he gets to play Luka Dacic. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1164.08s)]
*  And now there's a scenario where, Hey Luka, let me teach you some diet stuff. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1167.32s)]
*  Hey Luka, this is called the Versa climber. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1172.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you think of this thing? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1175.9199999999998s)]
*  Hey Luka, I see you're weighing about two 65 right now. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1177.28s)]
*  Do you realize if you weigh two 50, this, this, this, this, this happened. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  Hey Luka, here's why you keep hurting your calf. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1184.4399999999998s)]
*  You're not doing like Luka basically inherits the greatest personal trainer [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1186.76s)]
*  in the history of the league. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1190.12s)]
*  The brown doesn't get hurt. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1191.56s)]
*  Ever tried red wine instead of, uh, these, uh, you know, the Czech Pilsners that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1193.24s)]
*  you've been crushing over the last 10 years. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1197.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1199.96s)]
*  I think that's the scary thing of the tradesman. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1200.36s)]
*  This is what my dad said today is like, I don't want Luka on the Lakers for a [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1202.3999999999999s)]
*  million reasons, but what if he figures it out? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1205.36s)]
*  What if he's in better shape? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1209.04s)]
*  What happens then? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1210.44s)]
*  Well, dude, and he is, and I think a lot of us feel this way. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1211.96s)]
*  This is, they poked the bear and that's not a fat guy. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1215.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1218.6s)]
*  They, I meant to say FU potential now we have. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1219.12s)]
*  Huge FU potential bill. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1222.28s)]
*  Huge. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1224.1200000000001s)]
*  This guy, he talks like when I first got into Luka, when he would run his mouth [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1224.8s)]
*  against dudes like Pat Beverly and stuff, and he was a kid and he would just give [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1230.72s)]
*  it right back and sometimes more than he was getting, uh, and I was like, this [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1235.72s)]
*  guy is a competitor, uh, and now I, yeah, you guys did say this yesterday, but it's [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1240.24s)]
*  true, they poured a bunch of gas on this dude's fire and if he, if he's able to [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1245.4s)]
*  channel it the way that I think, and a lot of Mavs fans think right now, look [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1251.68s)]
*  out dude, because you're right. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1255.72s)]
*  He can come in and like LeBron 2012 mode, you know, after that Mavs series and [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1257.2s)]
*  just be like, all right, I'm, I'm here and I'm mad and I can't wait for February [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1263.16s)]
*  25th to play the Dallas Mavericks in Dallas. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to get in the craziest shape of my life. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1273.0s)]
*  I remember for page two in 2004, when Shaq got traded, I wrote a column called [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1274.48s)]
*  the vengeance scale and I ranked the vengeance scale from zero to a hundred. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1279.24s)]
*  Cause I thought like, I was like Shaq, at least for the next couple of years is [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1282.8400000000001s)]
*  going to get in shape and dedicate his life to trying to win a title and stick [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1287.4s)]
*  this up the Lakers ass and he eventually did. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1291.16s)]
*  Wade got hurt in 05. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1293.24s)]
*  He did in 06. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1294.96s)]
*  I think Luca, the competitive, he's both like crazy competitive, but also [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1296.68s)]
*  frustratedly competitive because if he was that competitive, he would be in better [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1301.8400000000001s)]
*  shape, but I think he's competitive enough that when somebody trades you. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1305.44s)]
*  You're just going to be pissed when you're playing for the Lakers in LA and this [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1310.8400000000001s)]
*  incredible franchise and you get in, you know, bathed in love from all that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1314.72s)]
*  You see the 77 jerseys, all that stuff. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1319.3600000000001s)]
*  Um, it has a chance to really ignite them. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1322.68s)]
*  And that would be the thing. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I feel so bad for the Mavs fans. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1326.8s)]
*  I've talked to a couple of them today. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1329.0800000000002s)]
*  Like they're just so devastated. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1330.24s)]
*  They just can't believe this. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1331.68s)]
*  And if I'm Mavs in the worst part of this trade is what happens if we lose in round [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1333.36s)]
*  two and Luca just goes on a heater for the next like eight years and we're like, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1338.1599999999999s)]
*  we fucking lost Jalen Brunson and Luca Doncic. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1343.8s)]
*  And I was on a thread with some Red Sox fans. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  We were arguing about the Mookie Betts trade versus the Luca trade and Luca, I [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1349.36s)]
*  think is a more important asset because it's so there's four untradable NBA guys [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1352.84s)]
*  every year and baseball, there's 25 guys on a team, but Mookie was our Luca [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1357.52s)]
*  basically. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1361.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1362.8400000000001s)]
*  And he, we'd actually won a title with them and he really was a unique, amazing [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1363.4s)]
*  top five, top eight player. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1367.92s)]
*  And we got, we didn't get Anthony Davis firm. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1370.52s)]
*  I'll just tell you that we got, we got Connor Wong and Jeter Downs and Alex [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1372.8400000000001s)]
*  Verdigo and we got rid of David Price's contract. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1377.88s)]
*  That was a trade and it made me not like baseball. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1380.48s)]
*  Like I don't really watch the Red Sox in the same way anymore. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1383.04s)]
*  So for the Mavs fans, like I know some Mavs fans like Jason Gallagher, who we [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1386.44s)]
*  used to work with, like he's, he's talking about like his son is like, I'm [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1390.96s)]
*  following Luca to the Lakers. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1396.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like, it's like a life long Mavs fan. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1398.04s)]
*  It's like, now I am a Laker fan. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1400.32s)]
*  That this is like that whole fucked up side of this is crazy. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1402.0s)]
*  No, it's totally true. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1405.64s)]
*  Like so many fans, like when Mbappe goes from PSG to Real Madrid, they're just [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1406.48s)]
*  like, I'm going to Real Madrid. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1411.8s)]
*  I'm a Real Madrid fan now, I guess. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1413.44s)]
*  This is a generational talent who is going to bring fans like Jason Gallagher's [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1416.2s)]
*  son with him, that's not going to be a unique story and that message board. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1421.2s)]
*  Poor Gallagher. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1426.0800000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1427.24s)]
*  Uh, but yeah, dude, that met, I went to the Mavs subreddit today and it was like [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1428.3600000000001s)]
*  sons of Sam Horne in October, 2003. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1433.88s)]
*  It was so bad. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1439.28s)]
*  Shit, they were going, they were going to the arena with like props. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1440.44s)]
*  Somebody brought a coffin. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  Like they were, they were having like a protest. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1444.56s)]
*  Something about a coffin to say goodbye to the Mavs. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1447.96s)]
*  Of just, just visceral pain, dude. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1450.76s)]
*  Well, and there's also some incredible conspiracy stuff already. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1454.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, God only knows what's true, half true, 10% true, but people thinking that. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1458.1599999999999s)]
*  What are your favorite conspiracy theories? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1463.96s)]
*  I love this one that the owners have always wanted the Vegas team and their, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1466.1599999999999s)]
*  their eventual goal is to basically flip franchises, move Dallas to Vegas so they [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1470.96s)]
*  can have their old casino thing. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1477.92s)]
*  The expansion team that was going to go in Vegas would be the Dallas team. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1479.52s)]
*  They'd pay whatever. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1483.24s)]
*  And the first way to do this was to be basically the torpedo, the Mavericks [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1484.6000000000001s)]
*  franchise relationship with their fans by trading Luka Donchits. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1488.88s)]
*  And it's like, I have no notes. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1491.92s)]
*  That's one of the best conspiracy theories I've ever heard. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  And I'm in Texas right now. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1496.44s)]
*  One more layer to that one is like gambling in Texas may or may not happen. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1497.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1503.36s)]
*  Probably not happening. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1503.72s)]
*  So yeah, like this family made, for those who don't know, this family [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1505.48s)]
*  made its money in Vegas, like they are a casino family. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1510.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1514.1599999999999s)]
*  So that's a good one. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1514.48s)]
*  Um, there's definitely some other ones about just trying to get ratings up and [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1517.1599999999999s)]
*  the Lakers back, but yeah, there's a lot of conspiracy. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1522.0s)]
*  That's what my dad said. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1525.76s)]
*  My, I mean, the father of conspiracy bill and conspiracy bill senior was like, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1527.32s)]
*  this just feels like the Lakers were about to die and they had to put another [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1532.0s)]
*  star in their team because my dad was like, how does this team keep pulling this off? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1535.4399999999998s)]
*  Like all the Celtic fans were just getting pissed about this today. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1540.56s)]
*  Cause this is the team we hate the most. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1543.56s)]
*  And it's just like, this team just steps in shit. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1545.1999999999998s)]
*  They're born on third base and the ultimate way they fuck up the entire [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1548.52s)]
*  2010s, the entire 2010s, even like they take Lonzo ball over Tatum. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1552.68s)]
*  Like you can point to a million things and it all leads to LeBron being like, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1558.0400000000002s)]
*  yeah, you know what? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  I really want to live in LA and they just miraculously lay on LeBron. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1563.6000000000001s)]
*  Then they have this clutch Alliance where like we're putting Anthony Davis [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1566.92s)]
*  on the Lakers, nobody else trade for him. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1570.68s)]
*  The Celtics are like, here are all these picks and we'll trade you Jalen Brown. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1572.48s)]
*  And they're like, nope, he's got to go to the Lakers. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1576.0400000000002s)]
*  So now they get Davis and LeBron together and then they get six years out of Davis [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1578.16s)]
*  and turn him into Luka Donchich, the best generational offensive prospect [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1582.36s)]
*  slash star slash heading into his prime guy since LeBron. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1587.28s)]
*  Ah, and they got, yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1592.56s)]
*  And you guys did a little of this yesterday, but they got Shaq and they got [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1594.6s)]
*  Pau Gasol exactly when they needed him. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1597.4399999999998s)]
*  And like, yeah, what we said in San Antonio is like, there's three teams. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  There's three ways to build an NBA team, the trade free agency and draft. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1603.52s)]
*  Um, and the Lakers really have access to all three of those levers in a way that [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1608.4s)]
*  no other team does specifically trades and free agency. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1613.0800000000002s)]
*  And this is just another example of that. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1616.76s)]
*  And the Spurs or the Grizzlies or the Thunder will never get a trade for [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1619.4s)]
*  somebody like Luka Donchich or a free agency play like that. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1624.3200000000002s)]
*  Uh, so they do start on third base. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1627.96s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1630.24s)]
*  And this is the updated version of them getting Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 50 years ago. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1631.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1636.68s)]
*  Uh, this is just wild, but it is kind of cool in that sense as an NBA historian. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1636.96s)]
*  It's not cool. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1642.1200000000001s)]
*  I hate it in line with this, but as Celtics fans, not, not exactly thrilled [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  with that historic like parallel, I guess. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1646.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1649.5600000000002s)]
*  You could do an all time nine man rotation of NBA 75 guys that they've [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1649.76s)]
*  traded for a signed in fridge. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1654.2s)]
*  See, will Kareem Shaq and Kobe. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1655.64s)]
*  Cause they traded for Kobe Gasol, Dwight, LeBron, AD, Luka. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1658.5600000000002s)]
*  Those guys are all top 75 guys that they acquired. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1662.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1666.0s)]
*  And pick any other NBA team and say, who's the best, who's the best [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1666.2s)]
*  player your team's ever traded for. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1669.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1671.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's like the Celtics would be Robert Parrish and KG I think would be the two [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1672.0s)]
*  best and that's in 80 years, unless you count the Bill Russell trade because [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1677.24s)]
*  they flip drafts, but yeah, it's really rare. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1680.76s)]
*  The Bucks or the even the Sixers or the Magic. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1684.1200000000001s)]
*  He just, these kinds of players don't, don't just show up on your doorstep. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1687.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1692.16s)]
*  And then the flip side for the Mavs. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  This is, I mentioned the Mookie Betts trade. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1693.96s)]
*  This is Edmonton trading Gretzky in 1988, which we did a 30 for 30. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1696.96s)]
*  That was actually the first 30 for 30 ever, but Gretzky had already won titles for them. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1701.3600000000001s)]
*  The whole point is Luka had not won the title for them yet. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1706.04s)]
*  He had the promise of, oh my God, we have this guy for the next 20 years. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1708.6000000000001s)]
*  Then we have the other weird piece Kirk about the Lakers who are playing well. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1713.3600000000001s)]
*  They still have to do the trade. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1719.5600000000002s)]
*  But the irony of them doing the trade right now was they had just started to look like [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1720.8s)]
*  a contender and they had an identity and they were big and physical and they'd [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1724.96s)]
*  figured out some of the spacing. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1728.96s)]
*  Christie and Finney Smith were both playing well at wing. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1730.76s)]
*  So they finally had competent wings they could put out there. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1733.24s)]
*  So that was part of the trade last night was the timing of it was like, I just [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1736.48s)]
*  watched this team and they look really good. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1740.28s)]
*  And now they just made the most shocking trade in the history of the league. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1741.68s)]
*  So a defense of the Luka trade from Dallas aside, I just want to do this as a [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1745.5200000000002s)]
*  thought exercise. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1749.88s)]
*  If you're trying to zag, what's the defense? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1752.48s)]
*  If you're like, you know what? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1758.68s)]
*  Nico Harrison has figured this out and he's going to show you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1759.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1763.72s)]
*  Trade was really smart. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1763.8000000000002s)]
*  What's the defense? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1765.0800000000002s)]
*  The defense is that the Luka Donjic is the next Joe Ellen beat. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1766.16s)]
*  He is a person who's probably the next Joe Ellen beat. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1770.2s)]
*  He is a person whose body isn't going to hold up to these crazy pace and space [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1773.4s)]
*  games that happen 82 times a year. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1779.04s)]
*  Plus playoffs like Luka played a hundred games last year. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1781.6000000000001s)]
*  He's repeatedly strained his calf. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1784.1200000000001s)]
*  We think there's an Achilles tear risk here. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1787.0s)]
*  We think there's a weight. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1789.28s)]
*  We think the lower body is going to go or the back's going to go. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1791.76s)]
*  And we're going to be on the hook for, for that Joe Ellen beat equivalent. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1794.88s)]
*  And we don't want to do it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1798.44s)]
*  And this is the last trade deadline opportunity we have to turn him into something. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1800.2s)]
*  Um, I don't take that stance, but that's the case. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1807.28s)]
*  And I think that's what they saw. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1810.4s)]
*  Moreover, I thought specifically they wanted Anthony Davis. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1812.0s)]
*  And I think they think they're a better team with Anthony Davis, uh, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1815.24s)]
*  then with Luka Donjic. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1820.92s)]
*  That's the only, I'll add to the defense. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1822.96s)]
*  Anthony Davis. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1825.24s)]
*  Anchor to finals team in 2020 that won it all. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1827.0800000000002s)]
*  Defense wins championships. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1830.1200000000001s)]
*  No defense stars don't win titles. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1834.16s)]
*  Go find me one. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1836.6000000000001s)]
*  Seeing a lot of no defense superstars take teams to round three, maybe even [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1838.44s)]
*  around four, but they don't win. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1842.3600000000001s)]
*  How do we know he was signing here in 2026? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1844.64s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1848.3200000000002s)]
*  Got to get out early. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1849.2s)]
*  The way to do this is to do it now. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1850.28s)]
*  And we feel like we can get a lot of value. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1852.1200000000001s)]
*  And then, uh, AD was the only guy we wanted. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1854.6000000000001s)]
*  Luka was never going to Milwaukee. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1858.3200000000002s)]
*  Boston wouldn't have tate them. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1859.76s)]
*  Bam's not good enough. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1861.24s)]
*  Katie's too old. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1862.28s)]
*  Edwards makes no sense for either side. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1863.88s)]
*  Jaylen Brunson. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1867.1200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1868.8400000000001s)]
*  So where are we shopping him to? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1870.24s)]
*  We're going to trade him for a bunch of picks. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1872.1200000000001s)]
*  Like we didn't want to do that. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1873.6000000000001s)]
*  We feel like our team's good. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1874.52s)]
*  I think that's the defense and it's moronic. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1876.76s)]
*  It's yeah, we'll see. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1880.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I will leave a sliver, a sliver of hope. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1882.28s)]
*  For the Mavs fans that they could be hoisting up Larry [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  O'Brien in the next year or two. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1891.24s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1893.44s)]
*  Uh, but they're so mad. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1895.6000000000001s)]
*  They'd probably boo the finals trophy ceremony throwing their [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1897.04s)]
*  Luka Dantius jerseys at it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1901.0800000000002s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  It's almost like Ohio state football. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1904.04s)]
*  Like they won the national title and they're still pissed off that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1905.64s)]
*  they lost that Michigan Michigan. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1908.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1909.96s)]
*  It was, but we're still mad. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1911.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1913.0800000000002s)]
*  Like they could literally boo the parade. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1913.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh, but yeah, I don't see it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1916.9199999999998s)]
*  I think they really believe that Anthony Davis, and I think this is Nico Harrison [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1919.56s)]
*  believing that Anthony Davis can anchor a top defense in the NBA and that with [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1927.12s)]
*  Kyrie and Clay and their role players, uh, that they can, they can compete for a title. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1932.76s)]
*  That's the, they still need one more trade. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1939.1599999999999s)]
*  I think they need a little, somebody a little more, uh, heat checky who [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1941.9599999999998s)]
*  can create their own shot and they still have time to do it because they have [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1945.48s)]
*  some tradeable contracts. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1948.3600000000001s)]
*  Who? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1949.8s)]
*  Jimmy Butler. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1951.0s)]
*  Is he from Daljee Houston? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1951.64s)]
*  Where's that from? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1952.8s)]
*  I forget. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1953.48s)]
*  Saruti just texted us that, uh, the Warriors, Jimmy Butler trade talks have finally [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1953.84s)]
*  ended because the Warriors did not want to commit to an extension and Jimmy Butler [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1958.0s)]
*  said, this is a, who reported this Saruti? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1962.44s)]
*  It was a, Wendy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1965.76s)]
*  Oh, Wendy reported. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1967.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1968.68s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, yeah, I was thinking about the one thing we didn't talk about yesterday [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1970.48s)]
*  because we were so dumb, dumbfounded by the trade. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1974.52s)]
*  Are there moves for the Lakers this year to become an interesting [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1978.08s)]
*  playoff team? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1982.28s)]
*  Because I'm positive. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1982.92s)]
*  I, if LeBron is playing like he did last night and he can just stay somewhat, uh, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1984.0s)]
*  healthy and fresh for a couple of rounds, that's not a team I want to see in round [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1989.16s)]
*  one or round two, then Luca with him. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1992.24s)]
*  And you just have these two freaky physical six foot eight, six foot nine [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1995.72s)]
*  guys who don't really have a position who can, who both have crazy hoops IQs. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=1999.6399999999999s)]
*  And then if you can put the right team around them, which they're inching closer [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2006.32s)]
*  to having, except they don't have any rim protection at all. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2010.8s)]
*  And could they go get Nick Claxton was a rumor today. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2014.8s)]
*  Could they take a flyer and Robert Williams? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2017.6799999999998s)]
*  Could they get Clint Capella with the Hawks want to trade a Kong woof for, for [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2020.08s)]
*  the 2031 pick, which put Austin Reeves on the table. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2025.4399999999998s)]
*  What could you get from him? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2030.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2032.32s)]
*  Austin Reeves is expendable now. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2032.52s)]
*  I mean, why do you need Austin Reeves? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2034.04s)]
*  Do you have Luca Donchich? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2035.1999999999998s)]
*  They need him. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2036.3999999999999s)]
*  How's the hour talking about this today? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2037.04s)]
*  You need him as your six man injury protection for one of those two guys, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2038.28s)]
*  somebody who's 25 minutes a game. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2043.08s)]
*  You always have to, you know, obviously the other two guys are way better [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2044.7199999999998s)]
*  offensively, but you always have two really good creators and Reeves is turning [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2049.0s)]
*  into a pretty good creator. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2052.6s)]
*  Um, at all times. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2054.3199999999997s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2056.48s)]
*  Do you think they're going to turn like Gabe Vinson, 2031, something [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2057.68s)]
*  else into like Nick Claxton? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2060.72s)]
*  Claxton and Timelord are the names that keep coming up. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  And I would guess that one of them will be on the Lakers. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2066.7999999999997s)]
*  I would guess that, um, they need a five. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2070.16s)]
*  Obviously they need a five. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2073.92s)]
*  They don't have it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2075.3199999999997s)]
*  You're not sold on Jackson Hayes. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2076.48s)]
*  Christian, Christian Wood. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2078.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2080.56s)]
*  I'm a professor at the university of Texas and Jackson is one of our, one of our guys. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  So I'm a big Jackson Hayes guy, but no, I want. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2084.96s)]
*  I want a five man. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2087.96s)]
*  And my question for you, Bill is like, do you believe that this Lakers team thinks [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2090.08s)]
*  they're going to compete for a title now this year in the next five months? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2095.16s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2099.88s)]
*  They should think that way. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2101.36s)]
*  And I didn't think they had a chance to win four straight rounds with the team. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2104.04s)]
*  They had, because it was putting too much LeBron look good against the next. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2107.12s)]
*  Like he was awesome against the next to ask somebody to do that for 10 straight [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2110.2s)]
*  weeks to me at age 40 is not realistic. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2113.8399999999997s)]
*  But now they have a guy who can, we've already seen him single-handedly beat [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2116.68s)]
*  teams in a series who's now going to be pissed off trying to shove it up somebody's [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2120.44s)]
*  ass. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2124.2s)]
*  So if I'm the Lakers, I feel like I could win the win three rounds now. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2124.56s)]
*  I feel like we're going to get into okay. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2129.7999999999997s)]
*  Say, and it's like, we have LeBron and Luca and you guys are small and we're [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2131.56s)]
*  going to just try to bully ball you and you can, you know, do whatever, but you [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2135.2s)]
*  we're still going to be a bitch to play. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2139.56s)]
*  I can't believe I'm saying this, but like they have the six best. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2141.88s)]
*  They were 21 to one last night. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2144.64s)]
*  Now they're 18 to one. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2146.2s)]
*  So people are betting them, which is not surprising, but if they get, if they get [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2147.24s)]
*  a rim protector and they can play LeBron and Luca with some sort of shooting point [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2151.52s)]
*  guard, Phinney Smith and the rim protector at crunch time with Reeves coming off the [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2157.0s)]
*  bench and some other pieces, like I wouldn't want to see him in a series. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2161.04s)]
*  That's where I'm at, but it hinges on that rim protector. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2165.84s)]
*  Cause right now they're just not built for a playoff run without rebounding and [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2168.32s)]
*  rim protection. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2173.48s)]
*  Well, they have the miracle of Palenka keeping Reeves and the 2031 picks. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2174.28s)]
*  So they, I mean, they go get that and that almost could be part of the trade. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2179.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2183.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2184.2000000000003s)]
*  And every call I'm sure you had today that I had today is like, oh yeah, they [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2184.4s)]
*  might trade LeBron to Golden state too, which I don't think will happen, but came [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2187.5600000000004s)]
*  up so many times today that we have to. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2191.92s)]
*  It came up last night too. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2194.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2195.88s)]
*  I think he stays. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2199.5600000000004s)]
*  It's a better career move. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2200.48s)]
*  And I think he likes LA. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2201.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2203.44s)]
*  You get traded, your son has to come with you. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2204.2400000000002s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2206.32s)]
*  Going to Golden state. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2207.5200000000004s)]
*  What ultimately are you going to happen? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2208.44s)]
*  You get to play with Curry. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2209.8s)]
*  It's an older team. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2210.6400000000003s)]
*  You have a better chance at winning the title with the team you have now. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2211.76s)]
*  If he's all about titles and like in, and, uh, an unbelievable out of nowhere [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2214.92s)]
*  title run, which still dubious, but you go through all these teams and all right. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2219.88s)]
*  They're playing Houston in round one. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2224.32s)]
*  Are you going against Luca? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2227.5200000000004s)]
*  Pissed off with LeBron as his sidekick. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2229.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2233.84s)]
*  Against like Fred van Vliet. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2234.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2236.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2237.6400000000003s)]
*  And there's still the buyout market too. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2237.84s)]
*  And these guys just became the biggest magnet and that market is always irregular [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2239.7200000000003s)]
*  and unreliable. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2245.48s)]
*  Don't, don't get me started, but every once in a while, uh, there is a valuable [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2246.6800000000003s)]
*  piece on the buyout market and they will get really attractive potential buyout [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2251.6400000000003s)]
*  pieces looking at their, their team. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2257.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, so I think they have two moves left. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2260.32s)]
*  You know, this is a big four day period for the Lakers front office. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2264.88s)]
*  They're going to look at sending out that pick. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2269.16s)]
*  They're going to look at sending out Austin Reeves, maybe even Rui Hashimura [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2272.08s)]
*  to try to turn it into something at the five, especially, uh, but around these [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2276.88s)]
*  two generational playmakers, two generational playmakers and two guys [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2283.72s)]
*  who do don't shrink in the playoffs. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2290.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2292.84s)]
*  Uh, so I think they are going to try to go, but they are, I think they're [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2293.16s)]
*  going to do a little bit cautious. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2298.16s)]
*  I'd be, I'd be surprised if the pick went, I'll say that. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2299.7200000000003s)]
*  I think they're going to try to do it with personnel. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2303.48s)]
*  Well, they're going to meet a situation where they're going to have to sign [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2306.8s)]
*  Luca this summer and LeBron is going to opt into his deal. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2309.36s)]
*  So they basically have one chance to align all the money because they're [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2313.68s)]
*  going to get crushed next year, no matter what happens, but they're the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2317.12s)]
*  Lakers and they shouldn't care because all of a sudden they have this meal [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2319.76s)]
*  ticket of LeBron was about to end with the season tickets, the suites, everything [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2324.4s)]
*  else, she had the Clippers in their new arena, which is awesome. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2328.4s)]
*  They Lakers playing in a shitty Staples center. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2330.8s)]
*  And now it's like, now it's now here's come see Luca Donchich. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2333.6000000000004s)]
*  And it's a guy that, you know, there's always been a weird thing with LeBron [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2338.8s)]
*  and the Laker fans, cause it's right after Kobe and there's this whole Kobe [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2341.8s)]
*  contingent and Luca had this awesome early relationship with Kobe and I could [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2345.08s)]
*  just see them being all in on adopting them. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2349.96s)]
*  And also he won't be the first guy to move to California and immediately lose [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2352.6s)]
*  20 pounds and look awesome and be tan and get in shape. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2356.44s)]
*  It's happened many times. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2359.4s)]
*  This is what happens when you come out here. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2361.2s)]
*  Perfect place for it. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2362.64s)]
*  Who's he going to be dating? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2364.08s)]
*  TMZ is getting ready, but yeah, in all seriousness, that 77 Jersey in purple [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2365.56s)]
*  and gold, how long till we start seeing the tweets that the number one selling [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2370.44s)]
*  Jersey in the NBA it's, it's already done. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2373.8s)]
*  Like it's, it's again, this is a team that just finds money. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2376.96s)]
*  Uh, and this is just an update. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2381.6400000000003s)]
*  We're not third base team. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2383.48s)]
*  It's frustrating as hell. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2384.5600000000004s)]
*  The thing with the Lakers though, they do have really good fans. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2387.0800000000004s)]
*  I got to hand it to him and they have an expectation. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2390.84s)]
*  It's annoying that it's always going to somehow work out, right? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2395.04s)]
*  Even if they're in the 2010s, they kept ending up with these picks and it was a [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2398.92s)]
*  mess and Kobe's last two years weren't great. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2402.8s)]
*  And it was always like, we're the Lakers. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2405.6000000000004s)]
*  This is going to work out. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2407.1200000000003s)]
*  The Celtics used to have that in the eighties and nineties. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2408.04s)]
*  It's like, what now it'll work out. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2410.1600000000003s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it didn't work out forever. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2411.32s)]
*  Um, and I was always like, just wait with this Lakers thing when LeBron leaves. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2413.44s)]
*  Just wait. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2417.48s)]
*  And now they ended up Luca Dacic. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2418.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2420.6400000000003s)]
*  And he'll probably be pissed off. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2420.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2422.92s)]
*  Cause it felt like they were heading towards an era where they were going to [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2423.1200000000003s)]
*  have a 34 year old Anthony Davis as their focal point. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2426.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2430.36s)]
*  Austin Reeves and, and Max Christie. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2431.36s)]
*  And now they're going to have a 27 year old Luca Dacic, uh, just angry at the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2434.6s)]
*  world, uh, and hopefully, you know, they are able to extend him. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2441.56s)]
*  And I do want to say that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2445.48s)]
*  And one of the sort of main points here is like, there's no guarantee he's [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2446.6400000000003s)]
*  going to sign that extension in Los Angeles. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2449.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh, what if Miami is like batting their eyelashes at him? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2452.08s)]
*  What if San Antonio? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2455.36s)]
*  Like what if Oklahoma city? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2456.36s)]
*  Like there, there are, there are teams that are going to let him know that [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2457.76s)]
*  they really want him to play there. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2462.0s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2463.88s)]
*  The NBA doesn't allow it to do that. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2464.36s)]
*  Kirk teams aren't allowed to talk to players from other teams. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2465.8s)]
*  That doesn't happen. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2469.44s)]
*  God. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2470.96s)]
*  But it's like, so I think that that's something I haven't heard talked about [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2471.36s)]
*  enough is there is a chance that he will not want to be there. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2475.28s)]
*  Um, I think it's a small chance. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2479.8s)]
*  I think he's now at the New York Yankees. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2482.0s)]
*  And he is sort of that a rod character is going to settle into that. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2485.28s)]
*  People don't leave the Lakers. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2490.08s)]
*  They, once you're here and you're on the Lakers and they're spending money and [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2491.6s)]
*  you're, you're in the sunshine, you don't guys have not left the Lakers. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2496.08s)]
*  Great players. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2500.36s)]
*  They stay. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2501.08s)]
*  That's what happens. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2501.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2503.2000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask sports guys. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2503.4s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2505.48s)]
*  Where is, how far did the Lakers go this year? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2506.32s)]
*  I feel like I'm going to throw it right now. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2515.08s)]
*  There are five seed. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2517.88s)]
*  They are tied with Denver and losses for the four seed and they're [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2521.76s)]
*  only three back from Memphis. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2526.1600000000003s)]
*  I think they have to get in the top half of that top four. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2528.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2533.1600000000003s)]
*  So they can have at least one home series. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2533.44s)]
*  I'm just, I'm all in on Luca. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2537.32s)]
*  I completely believe in him as a terrifying offensive force. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2539.08s)]
*  And I think he needed a kick in the ass like this. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2542.36s)]
*  I'm all in on him. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2544.6s)]
*  Like, I feel like they can make the finals. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2545.48s)]
*  I don't think it's crazy. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2548.2s)]
*  We watched him do it last year and he owns Oklahoma city. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2549.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2553.64s)]
*  That's what I was just going to say. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2554.32s)]
*  That's the one team they have to beat and he plays great against them. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2555.2400000000002s)]
*  And even this year he had a good game against them. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2557.96s)]
*  But, uh, you know, and then you take a team like Denver, how do you beat a [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2559.76s)]
*  team like Denver, um, with two really gifted offensive players, you know, and [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2563.52s)]
*  then there's the LeBron piece too. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2569.48s)]
*  This is like an amazing out of nowhere, you know, life raft for a chance to get [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2570.88s)]
*  another title and rewrite some of his shit. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2576.52s)]
*  And dude, I think his odometer benefits from this. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2580.76s)]
*  I think off ball LeBron is, uh, he lasts a little bit longer. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2583.44s)]
*  He's a little more durable than on ball LeBron. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2588.08s)]
*  And, and I think just him setting screens is a crazy concept. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2590.2400000000002s)]
*  Like I'm running pick and rolls, right? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2595.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2597.44s)]
*  He's the new Carl Malone. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2597.52s)]
*  He's just, he just becomes Carl Malone for them. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2598.72s)]
*  And he's the thing last night in the Knicks game, physically, he was so [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2601.24s)]
*  impactful compared to everyone on the Knicks. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2607.0s)]
*  It just didn't feel like they had a big enough athlete to handle him. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2609.16s)]
*  And LeBron hasn't felt like that in a while. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2612.56s)]
*  It really feels like maybe he knew that Luca trade was coming and that's why he [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2614.52s)]
*  was playing with a little, uh, little pep in a step, but, um, I just think those [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2618.7599999999998s)]
*  guys are going to be really hard to play. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2623.3999999999996s)]
*  There's a flip side of this where those two are a disaster on defense. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2624.4s)]
*  You can't play the two of them with Reeves together. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2628.7200000000003s)]
*  JJ, who is now realizing the weight of holy shit, I took this Lakers job. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2631.4s)]
*  And now we have Luca Donchich. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2635.6s)]
*  He's like, his hair's fucking falling out by April. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2637.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, they aren't able to get the right rim protector. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2640.32s)]
*  Like I would say it's 65 35 for me. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2642.6s)]
*  That they could actually be an incredibly dangerous playoff team versus, but I was, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2646.6800000000003s)]
*  I was surprised with the people I talked to today. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2651.28s)]
*  Like people kind of weren't seeing the immediate title picture. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2653.28s)]
*  I think Luca, as long as he's healthy, he has to be, it's like Jokic. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2656.4s)]
*  It's like when Denver looked like shit in the start of the season and we were all [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2660.6s)]
*  worried about them, it's like, well, they still have Jokic. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2664.2s)]
*  Like I'm not counting them out yet. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2665.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2668.88s)]
*  I mean, Oklahoma city gets my respect. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2669.12s)]
*  They deserve it. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2671.56s)]
*  Me too. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2672.48s)]
*  Beyond that Houston, who I adore Memphis, I love, I just think they're both too [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2672.92s)]
*  young really. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2679.12s)]
*  And if you're telling me I have Luca and LeBron against either of those two teams, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2680.48s)]
*  there's a case for those Lakers to just, to, to, to get them with wisdom. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2685.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, I would say the Clippers from a defensive roster standpoint are actually built [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2690.24s)]
*  the best to kind of battle this team, which means maybe we'll finally get the [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2696.24s)]
*  Clippers Lakers series we've been waiting for forever. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2699.7599999999998s)]
*  But yeah, I just think in a series, it's going to be really hard to match baskets [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2702.12s)]
*  with them if Luca's right. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  And I don't know why he wouldn't be right. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  He was averaging 28 a game by the way. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2709.0s)]
*  I know he's having like his worst statistical year, but, um, yeah, this is an [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2710.84s)]
*  amazing way we put it, we put it on wax your season tickets for the Clippers. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2716.04s)]
*  We put it on wax like three weeks ago that we've was like, let's not forget [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2720.48s)]
*  the Los Angeles Clippers and then quiet comes back and they've looked like the [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2724.28s)]
*  best team in the NBA at times. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2727.8s)]
*  So today, um, what happened today? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2730.2400000000002s)]
*  They lost yesterday. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2733.44s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2734.52s)]
*  They lose to, uh, Toronto. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2735.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2737.68s)]
*  They lost to Toronto. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2738.32s)]
*  Um, but yeah, like over the last two months, or I should say January, just [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2739.44s)]
*  look it up, like their indicators scream. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2744.2000000000003s)]
*  This is we're, we're good and their defense has been good all year. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2747.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, and as we say, for them though. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2751.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2754.44s)]
*  Um, yeah, Clippers versus Lakers. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2755.36s)]
*  We could see it amazing trade. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2758.04s)]
*  Uh, congrats to the Spurs for getting Fox as well. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2760.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2763.0800000000004s)]
*  We have four days until the trade deadline, Kirk. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2763.52s)]
*  I don't know what else to expect. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2765.8s)]
*  We don't know where Jimmy Butler's going. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2767.08s)]
*  Um, there's still, what are the things should we be watching? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2769.16s)]
*  Jimmy Butler, the nets, the nets have a for sale sign up in the front yard. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2773.88s)]
*  Um, I think both Claxton and Cam Johnson are, um, on the move. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2778.36s)]
*  If I had to guess Miami, God only knows what they're up to our Memphis and [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2784.68s)]
*  Houston going to feel like they should do something, which is, we'd be great [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2790.08s)]
*  for the Lakers if they didn't. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2793.64s)]
*  Is Cleveland going to take her with anything at all? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2795.56s)]
*  Vucovich is another one. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2797.7200000000003s)]
*  Can the sons get up, Nurkic's deal with the pick and try to, uh, try to get, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2798.96s)]
*  uh, a better rim protector. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2804.08s)]
*  And then, uh, Grant, I think is one to watch in Portland. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2807.2000000000003s)]
*  If Portland can find a taker for Jeremy Grant and Ken Milwaukee figure out [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2811.32s)]
*  anything would be my other question is that, are they just stuck with the team? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2816.04s)]
*  They have my classic Bill Simmons trope that was relevant this crazy weekend [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2821.52s)]
*  is new owner syndrome, which by the way, when the bucks changed owners, that's [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2826.24s)]
*  when this Lillard thing happened and the drew holiday thing, um, this is like [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2831.0s)]
*  the owners remain the most underrated characters in pro sports sagas. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2836.48s)]
*  And this is another example. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2841.12s)]
*  Would Mark Cuban have done this deal? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2842.96s)]
*  Um, so I was texting somebody about that today saying Cubans got to be [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2846.32s)]
*  disconsolate because first of all, he trades the Mavs as the fran or [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2851.2400000000002s)]
*  sells the Mavs as the franchisers are going up. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2855.36s)]
*  He's seems like he had a feeling like he might be involved. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2858.12s)]
*  He's not. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2861.52s)]
*  And then Luca, this is hand-picked. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2862.6s)]
*  Like if they win the title, he gets to take credit for that [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2864.56s)]
*  forever. Now they trade them. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2868.2400000000002s)]
*  I remember one of the, we, we did a grand feature with Mark in 2013 or 14 on, you [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2870.64s)]
*  know, at that time he was like symbolic of this new era of bad boy tech owner guy. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2875.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2880.2s)]
*  And we talked about how the Mavs were a laughing stock before him, you know, and [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2880.52s)]
*  no, no disrespect to Mark and choir or Orlando Blockman, but they were never a [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2885.68s)]
*  great franchise. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2890.08s)]
*  Then he gets him to the finals two or three times. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2891.44s)]
*  And it sure looks like this new ownership group is, is taking things [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2894.56s)]
*  in a different direction. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2899.2400000000002s)]
*  So yeah, he's gotta be just so destroyed. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UMydF5a918&t=2900.2s)]
