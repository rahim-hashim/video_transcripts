# Indiana Steals Game 1 in OKC… WTF Happened??? | The Bill Simmons Podcast with Zach Lowe
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI)
*  You [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=0.0s)]
*  What [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=30.0s)]
*  Zach Lewis here, thanks to state farm for sponsoring our [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=39.28s)]
*  YouTube live stream that we were state farm [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=43.76s)]
*  We were assuming it would be an okc 20-point easy win [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=47.08s)]
*  We would have to make weird okc conversation because they're hard thing to talk about and then [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=51.68s)]
*  Indiana Indiana was like I can't even speak Indiana was like where Michael Myers [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=56.86s)]
*  You thought we were dead [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  We fell out of the out of the deck in the back and we landed on our back and you looked out there [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=63.9s)]
*  And all of a sudden we weren't there and we just keep coming and coming then eventually we get you and you don't know what happened [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=69.3s)]
*  It's I I can't speak I've come to the conclusion that I just don't get the Indiana Pacers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=76.06s)]
*  I don't get I don't get how they do this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  I don't get how there's at least one game every series where they do this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=83.86s)]
*  It's Halliburton at the end of every game with the last shot emerging. I mean like [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=87.06s)]
*  The number of clutch shots he's made this season in this playoffs [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=91.78s)]
*  This is like an all-time legendary crunch time heater and he didn't even play that well in the course of the game and all [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=95.14s)]
*  Anyone's gonna remember is the last shot it this is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=101.14s)]
*  The Pacers are unbelievable and this might be I mean look we've all seen thousands of basketball games [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=104.14s)]
*  No, this might say this was weirder than the Knicks game one [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=111.54s)]
*  This is this might be the it was weird because it was weird the whole time [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=114.54s)]
*  It was weird like how do they have 19 turnovers in the first half and they're not getting run out of the building [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=118.54s)]
*  It's 11 and between 11 and 13 the whole game. I don't like it just felt like the strangest [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=125.18s)]
*  It's the strangest game I've ever watched I think start to finish and then the finish puts it over the top [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=131.76s)]
*  Like I don't I can't wait to rewatch the fourth quarter to see what happened Oklahoma season [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=137.2s)]
*  I just can't believe Indiana won that game. It's unbelievable. We have a series we did weird word. We're gonna say we got a series [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=141.6s)]
*  19 turnovers and Lou Dort had five threes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=148.48s)]
*  I think in the first three quarters and if you just told me those two things I would have assumed okay [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=151.33999999999997s)]
*  See one by 25 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Halliburton was really tentative [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=157.2s)]
*  It felt like [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Indiana was gonna lose by 20 plus various points in the game [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=161.56s)]
*  Okay, see was doing the thing over and over again where they're up nine. They're up 11. They're up nine. They're up seven [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=166.4s)]
*  They're up 11 and you just wait for them to put together that last 10 [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=170.84s)]
*  No run when they're up 21 and the game's over and it just never happened. I think they got up to maybe 15 [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=174.4s)]
*  Right 13 or 15 was the highest lead and it just hovered it hovered in that range from like [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=181.4s)]
*  11 to 13 which is not really a range [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=188.0s)]
*  It's just small small range and they could never land the knockout punch, but then they go it's back to eight [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=190.9s)]
*  It's back to nine. It's back to six. It's back to eight again, and it's all of a sudden Indiana's won the game [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=197.02s)]
*  You know what the other was the moment where it was like, wait a second [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Turner first of all in demand, I think seven eight [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=206.26s)]
*  Crazy threes were like that's not going in then it would go in but Turner hit that three the way you're stepped to the left [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=210.06s)]
*  And he banked it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=215.82s)]
*  When he did that I was on alert after that it was like, oh, okay [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=217.54s)]
*  all the all the stuff I was working on for the rundown was Zach might be just going up and smoke but [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so we took three field goals in the last four minutes of the game Zach [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  That's weird. I didn't I mean I can't wait to watch the game again because I need I didn't like the feel of Oklahoma [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=231.14s)]
*  City's offense almost the entire game. I meant made that take by the way [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=239.94s)]
*  Whatever, you know what? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=243.94s)]
*  I didn't I didn't like their the feel their offense almost the whole game [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=244.9s)]
*  That a lot of that is credit to the Pacers their transition defense was unbelievable to turn the ball over [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=249.02s)]
*  I mean it says 24 in the box score [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  I think that doesn't include a couple of like like other like extra team turnovers or whatever things like 25 or 26 and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=255.82s)]
*  To not get just under water from an avalanche of transition points [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=262.66s)]
*  But I didn't like I mean Shay had 38 and it was just I didn't love his shot selection for a lot of the game [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=267.78s)]
*  And I thought it felt like he was just taking a lot of shots [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=274.3s)]
*  Like he had 11 in the first quarter would end up with 30 30 shots in a yeah, it's too many and some I didn't like [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  And it felt like I thought I thought num hard really look he had 38 points [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=285.38s)]
*  But I thought num hard was about as comfortable as I've seen anyone [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=290.7s)]
*  Defending Shay it was like one of those things where it looked like they've been playing against each other for ten years [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=294.68s)]
*  He kind of knew I was stop and start moves [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=298.88s)]
*  Even in the end when she got that last shot that would have put him up by 3d missed it [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=301.56s)]
*  Now I'm hard was right there the whole time with them like pretty comfortable. I thought [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=305.16s)]
*  And I just thought they were they got slowed down a little bit and like not a lot of flow to their offense a lot of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=309.84s)]
*  Possessions or is like SGA ISO. All right, Nemhart kind of stoned me kick to j-dub [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=317.32s)]
*  ISO and just sort of just there wasn't a lot of flow and I don't know if it's because [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=322.4s)]
*  They were playing just one big the whole time and and and I thought this was a good one big series for them [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=327.0s)]
*  Clearly they agreed they start case and Wallace over Hartnestein [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=333.64s)]
*  But a lot of their best passing sequences are the big to big passing sequences and they they sort of got those out of their [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=337.2s)]
*  Out of their game by the lineup choice [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=343.56s)]
*  They made maybe it was the pressure the defense the stage the unfamiliar lineups like a lot of five out [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=345.96s)]
*  They're not unfamiliar, but just they clearly rejiggered their rotation for this. I didn't like the way their offense flowed but [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=352.44s)]
*  Still can we just like you mentioned the bank? Can we say one thing about that rotation thing? Yes [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=358.96s)]
*  I think this is the key to the game [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  Did you look at the rebounds? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=366.0s)]
*  It's whoo [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  Okay, 56 to 39, I mean it's not 56 to 39, Indiana [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=372.64s)]
*  So okay, see goes one big instead of two [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=378.6s)]
*  Indiana averages 39 rebounds a game in the playoffs [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=381.6s)]
*  Like if you're gonna say what's the weakest part of their game you'd say I'm worried about the rebounds [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  Especially against a team that plays double bigs. Okay, see starts one big down the stretch [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=388.72s)]
*  They go small ball completely and give up a couple big offensive rebounds to see Akam [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=393.76s)]
*  I just why is okay see changing with their okay sees 80 and 18 heading into this game [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=398.76000000000005s)]
*  Why are they changing their lineups like this? Why are they going super small at the end of the games? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=404.68s)]
*  Like they're the heavy favorites their home make why are you changing to conform to Indiana? I don't get that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=409.06s)]
*  So I was surprised [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=416.0s)]
*  I mean I talked for two podcasts in a row about how I thought probably the one big lineups were gonna be a little bit [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  Smoother for the Thunder [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean lots of people made this point to it was not like an original by me [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=426.16s)]
*  Just because the siaka matchup is a tough one for for the okay [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  They're big and and a better one for j-dub or Caruso or whoever takes the matchup [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=433.88s)]
*  But I still thought that they would start [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=439.44s)]
*  Like every team just starts how we start and you got to force us to adjust and Richard Jefferson on the broadcast is making [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=443.2s)]
*  The point like if you're Indiana, this is a win [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  Like they've adjusted to us already and I was thinking the opposite way. I think it was like a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=451.04s)]
*  Cold-blooded we're going for the kill right out of the shoot in game one. We're not by the way [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=456.12s)]
*  It did not work. They got 19 turnovers at the first half [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=461.92s)]
*  If you like you should it this is an all-time impossible outcome [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=466.04s)]
*  24 turnovers to six against the Thunder and the Thunder don't win the game is just absolutely bonkers [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=471.0s)]
*  So plus 17 rebounds Indiana somehow ends up at 24 assists and it's notable that okc has 13 [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=478.7s)]
*  Because that's how it felt watching it. It felt like [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=486.42s)]
*  It was a lot of one-on-one stuff. I didn't feel like they were running enough. I actually didn't think [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=489.82s)]
*  Like I had all these separate notes [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=495.02000000000004s)]
*  I was gonna be what can Indiana do better for game two when it seemed like they were gonna lose [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  The number one thing was it didn't feel like they were running. I felt like the pace [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=501.62s)]
*  I thought they were psyched out by the defense and the steals and the turnovers and they weren't taking off on chances that they had [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=505.76s)]
*  But it somehow worked out anyway, and they won [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=511.68s)]
*  I think there's things that they can do to be even better in game two [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=513.6s)]
*  So when you say we have a series like I bet Indiana thinks we have a series too because they're like we didn't really play [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=516.6s)]
*  That well, we got we we rebounded. Well, nobody in our team was really awesome [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=523.42s)]
*  I mean them hard I thought had a good all-around game top and it's in threes [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=527.46s)]
*  But we weren't running like we should have and we were really sloppy with the ball in the first half because [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=531.62s)]
*  Honestly, they look nervous and how Britain even said in that mic thing. He was like, I'm finally getting my breath [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=536.22s)]
*  I'm fine. Like it's nerve-racking to be in the finals. You and I have been in the arena for those things [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=541.46s)]
*  It's a different kind of tension energy. Everybody's out there for three hours. And when you're a young team you feel it [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  They look nervous to me and then they were fine. We're gonna be there soon. It's gonna be it's gonna be exciting [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=551.76s)]
*  obi-top in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=557.34s)]
*  Five threes after a start in which he looked like a little bit overwhelmed for the first 90 seconds [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=559.18s)]
*  He was on the floor and I think three turnovers in two minutes [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  Can we do but you mentioned the bank shot three? Yeah, which was by the way [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=567.9399999999999s)]
*  It was a play that the Celtics run a lot where miles Turner fakes [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=572.5799999999999s)]
*  Like he's gonna set a pin down for Halliburton and then Halliburton [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  Switches it up and sets a monster like double pin down for miles Turner [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=580.3399999999999s)]
*  That's a play that Tatum and Horford run all the time and he banks in the three [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=584.06s)]
*  There was a lane violation on a siakam miss three. I loved it. I by the way watching it in real time [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=588.28s)]
*  I was like that's Scott. That's a lame violation on somebody. There's four guys in the paint right now [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=594.14s)]
*  There's a tipped air ball like an air ball [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=598.76s)]
*  That's tipped tipped in or put back in by siakam just like and and by the way and also you mentioned just the threes like [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=601.62s)]
*  Neesmith makes one in the corner on like a broken play where obi-top is dribbling around trying to find someone to give it to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  Neesmith makes a three [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=613.68s)]
*  Yeah, I guess Neesmith in the last in the fourth quarter of a desperate game is just never ever going to miss a shot again [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=614.68s)]
*  He's Michael Jordan and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=620.8199999999999s)]
*  the Pacers shot [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=623.08s)]
*  39 threes [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=625.08s)]
*  44% of their shots were threes [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  That's way above their average and I think it's an absolute must for them to have any chance to win this series [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=629.36s)]
*  Increase their three-point attempts against the defense that will get not give them up because they can test them pretty well [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=635.24s)]
*  But they'll crowd the paint and make you shoot threes and take more increase the variance and they ended up taking [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  What 39 threes compared to 30 for the Thunder and the Thunder took a lot more field goals [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=646.52s)]
*  That's that's a big reason they won the game 18 of 39 46 percent on threes. Whoo. Well, tell me if you agree on this [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=652.24s)]
*  They were firing them with no hesitation and I think it was part of their game plan [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=659.84s)]
*  Especially on the road where you were okay. So he's been [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=664.32s)]
*  Such an absolute juggernaut and I think Carlisle told everybody [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=667.36s)]
*  You had the three shoot immediately because you could see these okay see guys flying out on the corners on the top [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=671.1600000000001s)]
*  But they but and I didn't feel like a lot of those threes weren't contested, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=679.28s)]
*  Wasn't like they some of the corner threes I guess were a little open but for the most part [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=684.08s)]
*  Wasn't like they were wide open. It's 106 98 with three minutes left [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=688.08s)]
*  Siakam misses two free throws in a row lane violation gets one SGA makes two free throws [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=692.32s)]
*  Knee Smith hits the three you mentioned [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=698.12s)]
*  j-dub misses [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=701.1600000000001s)]
*  Nemhart heat check [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=702.88s)]
*  Hesitation has he stepped back three. I got nothing going on. I'm just gonna make something happen and make a three [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=705.5600000000001s)]
*  I think it was on Lou Dort to so they're all the sudden they're down three [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  SGA gets a two they're down five. No mark gets free. No mark gets free throws. Siakam blocks SGA [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=715.96s)]
*  Unbelievable play and the door somewhere there. There's the door block where it where it feels like on on knee Smith [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=722.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=729.34s)]
*  Where it's like that might be the defining defensive play of the game and then there's another defining defensive play the right 45 siakam [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=730.08s)]
*  offensive rebound [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=736.5200000000001s)]
*  Scores all send indies down one j-dub misses out of bounds play. I [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  Thought he got I thought siakam got fouled. They didn't call it. I thought though. I thought that was a clear foul [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=743.4000000000001s)]
*  I was surprised that not only did Indiana not win that challenge but that it was decided fairly quickly by the officials [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=748.0s)]
*  So okay [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=753.76s)]
*  C has the ball now 22 seconds left with 14 on the shot clock they go to SGA [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  Who's been unstoppable this entire season and has always scored in this situation pretty much [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=759.2s)]
*  It feels like 90% of the time num hard plays good defense gets to stop no timeout by Carlisle [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=763.84s)]
*  And then Hal Burton has one of those I'm not sure what to do and I'm going against an incredible defensive player and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=769.4s)]
*  Takes a long long to double pump almost [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=776.52s)]
*  So the semi double pump what I got I got I haven't watched it again [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=779.96s)]
*  I just went I just like my chair and logged on to the zoom and I don't really know what happened [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=783.76s)]
*  it was ugly, but he made it and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=788.48s)]
*  There we go 14 10 and 6 for Hal Burton and I felt like he was pretty tentative for most of the game [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=791.64s)]
*  That's a pretty nice outcome for him. So so you mentioned the j-dub miss three. I want to go back to that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=796.88s)]
*  That is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=805.0s)]
*  Two minutes and 20 seconds left thunder by six. Yep [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=807.4s)]
*  If my notes are right and they're a little scribbly [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=812.4s)]
*  SGA's had a seizure. I don't know what was going on SGA Dort pick and roll up top [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=816.8s)]
*  Probably because Hal Burton is on Dort. I'm guessing yeah SGA splits it clean like Hal Burton hedges. I think it's helping [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=823.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing this live. It might not be how but it's what no you're right [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=830.16s)]
*  Going down it seems like he's gonna do an edge down hill [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=832.76s)]
*  You're a step layup [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=834.96s)]
*  If you freeze it when he gets into the paint and he had just gotten fouled [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=835.8000000000001s)]
*  I believe it made two free throws like a minute before 30 seconds before [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=839.4s)]
*  He gets in the paint [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=843.28s)]
*  Every single other Indiana defender on the floor is just like fuck it [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=845.0s)]
*  We're coming into the paint like you are not shooting this shot and we are also not gonna foul [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=849.16s)]
*  You have to pass the ball everyone left corner right corner j-dub on the wing [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=853.6s)]
*  He kicks it to j-dub and that's the knockout punch right there [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=858.58s)]
*  I wrote that in my notes the KO punch won't come he misses that shot and that was the moment where I thought [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=861.96s)]
*  They might they might actually win this thing and go up 1-0. I have an important question [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=867.6600000000001s)]
*  Did you think the shot was going in because I did not the j-dub shot or the Halliburton shot the j-dub shot I [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=874.5400000000001s)]
*  I [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=881.7800000000001s)]
*  Wasn't watching the trajectory to be honest. I was watching the release. It looked fine when it went [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=882.86s)]
*  Clear he was when it was clear he was about to shoot [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=887.1s)]
*  Did you go in if I'm remembering correctly? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=889.9000000000001s)]
*  He he has like a little pass fake where he might pass it to the corner and then he decides to keep it himself [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=892.58s)]
*  That's always like a mmm. I don't know, but I don't remember feeling [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=897.22s)]
*  I did not think that was going you felt strongly about there was I forget what Denver game it was I think it was Denver [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=901.1s)]
*  What was the one where he hit that huge three that I didn't think was going in I think it was [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=908.74s)]
*  It was one of the Denver games and it was the same situation and he actually made it that time [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=914.0200000000001s)]
*  He did not make it. I [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=918.94s)]
*  Gotta say the more I'm thinking about it. I'm stunned that okay see change what they did so much in that game [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=922.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't really fully understand it [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=927.34s)]
*  I thought their biggest advantage was going to be the size and the rebounding and the and the rim protection and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=928.84s)]
*  I know you were making the case for one big at a time [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=936.0600000000001s)]
*  But even then like home Chet played 23 minutes and Heartenstein played 17 [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=938.6600000000001s)]
*  And Isaiah Joe played 11 minutes. I mean as a Joe he was fine. He was plus three [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=944.5400000000001s)]
*  He may he made two shots, but I felt like every moment when they had a swing out there [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=949.46s)]
*  That wasn't an absolute piranha defensively was you're giving Indiana like a little chance to breathe [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=954.32s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know is a weird coaching [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=960.86s)]
*  I'm very interested to see what they do because I would have started the double big lineup and sort of just modified the rotation [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=962.9000000000001s)]
*  So it's if it's going a certain way I go less double big more one big [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=969.94s)]
*  I thought the five out lineups like the no big lineups [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=973.94s)]
*  Looked incredible defensively like Indiana was just like where are we even supposed to go? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=977.62s)]
*  Right, although you lose all the rebounding but they lost too many of the rebound [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=982.5s)]
*  It was like a night. It was like we did everything right and then couldn't close the deal [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=986.34s)]
*  Yeah, you made the key point though with the foot with the first part in the first quarter. They were clearly [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=990.1800000000001s)]
*  A shoeing we're gonna do this for six minutes and then here's the lineup we love they're like fuck it [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=995.24s)]
*  We're gonna try to blow you out of the out of the arena in the first half, which they kind of did [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1000.78s)]
*  They did they did and it was I mean I just couldn't like when the turnovers just kept happening like every variety of turnover [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1006.6800000000001s)]
*  Entry passes back door passes lost it in the backcourt [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1014.0s)]
*  Dead ball turnovers there was I think the one that put him up 15 [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1018.36s)]
*  By the way, when you mentioned the biggest lead was when they couldn't inbound the ball from the TJ McConnell inbound [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1022.24s)]
*  Jdub dunked it and that felt again that felt like a knockout punch. Like how many times have we seen this game and the Pacers man? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1028.04s)]
*  They just keep on playing just keep playing. It's really they're just an up [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1034.56s)]
*  They're an awesome awesome team and they just keep on coming [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1039.24s)]
*  SGA had 18 shots in the first half. He was 8 for 18 and plus 15 just I'm not gonna lie [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1042.48s)]
*  I got a text from an assistant coach who was like is he gonna shoot 40 times in this game? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1048.6s)]
*  Like are we gonna see a 40 shot performance by SGA and it was not a compliment. I [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1052.9199999999998s)]
*  saw a stat [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1058.36s)]
*  Today somewhere on social media that Shaq was the last scoring champ to win the title and it did make me pause for a second [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1060.36s)]
*  I was like, wow 25 years since that's happened. It seems like a long time [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1067.08s)]
*  Who? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1071.96s)]
*  Well, I'll do some of my notes that I still feel like we can still use [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1073.24s)]
*  Because I was gonna ask you this after okay see one but now they didn't win who is the MVP of that game? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1077.4s)]
*  If this was hockey, you're not a hockey guy. This is hockey who's the star of the game? Who's the guy who skates out last? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1083.36s)]
*  Waves to the crowd. I think the guy who skates out last is Halliburton just because he made the shot at the end [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1090.2s)]
*  I think this sneaky MVP of the game for Indiana and it's just so befitting of how he plays is Siakam just quietly [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1095.76s)]
*  19 and 10 makes big plays defends everywhere [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1103.84s)]
*  You kind of don't notice him for a little while and but he's just a consistent [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1107.52s)]
*  Positive force for them miles Turner was good in 28 minutes and then the top and five threes and McConnell [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1112.28s)]
*  Kept them afloat [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  During a couple stretches where it looked like it could get out of hand [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  Those were that's those are nine big points for TJ McCauley's minus 13. I get it [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1123.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not like a fantastic game, but those buckets felt huge [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1128.4s)]
*  So I would say Nemard [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1132.84s)]
*  Because I thought there were a couple moments [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1137.04s)]
*  Where if he didn't play with the confidence that he had down the stretch? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1139.8799999999999s)]
*  I just think they immediately lose but you could also talk me to Siakam Siakam had ten rebounds [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1143.5s)]
*  it's interesting how burned it to because I was looking at the props for this game on Fandel before the game and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1148.1999999999998s)]
*  I had to do that Taylor fade pick which I ended up doing [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1154.1999999999998s)]
*  SGA two threes which hit but I was initially gonna do Siakam rebounds cuz I was like who's gonna get rebounds on Indiana [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1157.36s)]
*  And I went I looked at his rebound game log and he's really like four or five six a game this game [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1163.7s)]
*  He had ten and he had a couple big offensive rebounds. I thought in traffic like to keep [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1169.2s)]
*  Plays alive and in general. I just felt like they kept plays alive a couple times. So did okay [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1175.6s)]
*  See, okay. See had a couple good tapouts. But if I'm okay, see I'm [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1180.5s)]
*  Screw this let's go big again. We can't get we can't go minus 17 on the boards at home [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1185.08s)]
*  You know, it's interesting one of the more eye popping stats in the box course Chet Homer's minutes [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1191.8799999999999s)]
*  What you mentioned earlier is 23 something change [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1197.46s)]
*  to second or third best guy in the team and [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  Some of it is probably because [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1206.04s)]
*  He's on Miles Turner and that's fine like that's not a bad defensive matchup or anything [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1208.48s)]
*  but Miles Turner is a pick and pop big man and [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1214.28s)]
*  Shay, I'm sorry Chet has made his bones in the NBA and made Oklahoma City's defense [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1217.32s)]
*  superpowered by being at the rim all the time and [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1222.96s)]
*  By virtue of how they are matching up in this series so far through one game [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1226.52s)]
*  He can't be at the rim all the time [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1230.72s)]
*  All the time and I wonder if he just doesn't feel as useful to dag gnawed if he's not in that role like he's guarded [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  Jada McDaniels, he's guarded Aaron Gordon [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1240.76s)]
*  He's guarded guys where he could just be at the basket all the time, which is why you know [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1242.92s)]
*  I I thought that they would start big and I said on my pot [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  I thought I would try him on siakam and I realized that looks like a bad matchup for Chet and was made this point [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1251.3600000000001s)]
*  On group chat this week is like because siakam can just kind of get under taller skinnier guys and do siakam stuff [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1258.9199999999998s)]
*  And I was like I still would try it because he's got to finish over Chet [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1264.6s)]
*  Even if he backs him under the rim and I just like Chet near the basket if Chet's gonna be on the floor [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1269.68s)]
*  I like him near the basket and I just wonder if maybe I'm crazy [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1274.8s)]
*  but I wonder if they do start double big if they match up that way heart and stein on Turner and [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1278.56s)]
*  Chet on siakam, but yeah, they went for they went for the jugular with that adjustment [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1283.52s)]
*  They were like we're not messing around and it kind of worked and then nothing worked [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1288.96s)]
*  Can I extend your point? Yeah, I just want Chet in the court [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1294.64s)]
*  I think he's one of the 20 best guys in the league playing him 23 minutes in the finals game seems crazy to me [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1298.52s)]
*  I don't understand why he wouldn't be out there. I mean he was two for nine [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1304.48s)]
*  Maybe they thought he looked nervous. I don't know you made a point you kind of ruined [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1308.8400000000001s)]
*  And you hurt my feelings earlier in the week when you did your Tibbs the thing you the beginning of your pod [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1313.32s)]
*  Yesterday and you did the whole thing about when we complained about [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1318.46s)]
*  Coaches and adjustments and then you talked to a coach and you realized there's so much smarter than you [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1322.0800000000002s)]
*  And I was like don't lift the curtain for me Zach [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1327.0s)]
*  I want to feel like I'm as smart as these guys because I don't tell me how much don't tell me how much smarter they are [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1329.04s)]
*  Than me. I'd like to second guess them but my addendum to that would be and I should have made it and I'll make it here [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1334.52s)]
*  Is that even if they are? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1343.24s)]
*  Aware of all of these criticisms and our five steps ahead of you [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1345.88s)]
*  They still and I think this is what to where Tibbs falls [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  They still will default to what they feel most comfortable doing [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1352.32s)]
*  Even if some part of them is like I should try this I should try that or some coaches will do that [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1357.2s)]
*  I think Tibbs is like that Tibbs can Tibbs could sit down and tell you [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1361.8400000000001s)]
*  17 different counters to 17 different adjustments that you think he should do and why they wouldn't work and [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  Still be aware of like they might work, but I'm he's gonna lean on to what he knows. But anyway, go ahead. Well [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1371.48s)]
*  So Carlisle there's two and I thought there was good mic'd up moments in this game Carlisle [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1377.4399999999998s)]
*  They had in the huddle in the first half [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1382.9199999999998s)]
*  And he said [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1385.84s)]
*  You can't dribble into a crowd against this team. You can't throw mid bounce passes into the middle against this team [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1387.9599999999998s)]
*  And which was actually a lot of information from a coach usually it's like guys play hard [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1395.1999999999998s)]
*  You got to move your legs, but he was basically like [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1399.84s)]
*  You're entering the bowels of hell when you go into the middle and you're dribbling. Please don't do that [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1403.72s)]
*  I kept I obviously I have to bring the Celtics into this it's been 20 minutes [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1409.8s)]
*  I did think today about [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1413.56s)]
*  Jalen Brown and a couple of the other Celtics just dribbling into the middle in this game and how bad some of the plays would have [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1415.08s)]
*  Gone, but then at halftime they showed Carlisle to talking to the team and they showed in the third quarter and he's like [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1420.48s)]
*  Hey 19 turnovers, we're not playing well. We're fine. Keep doing what you're doing [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1427.6s)]
*  Keep like he clearly like wasn't rattled by whatever he saw in the first half and their strategy was like as long as you don't turn [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1432.04s)]
*  The ball over we're gonna shoot threes. We're gonna keep the pace [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1438.36s)]
*  I like the pace we're at and we can kind of hang around because that was not how I felt at halftime and [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1441.24s)]
*  Halftime I was like they're gonna lose by 25 [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1446.72s)]
*  No at halftime. I felt like I was in the twilight zone for like the entire first half [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1449.12s)]
*  I was like, is this a real game? Am I dreaming? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1455.04s)]
*  How many turnovers do they have and yet the score is only 12 11 where I died the whole game [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1458.48s)]
*  I felt like I was hallucinating everything that was happening including maybe right now [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1463.72s)]
*  I don't know if the town Tyrese Albert and hit another last second shot. Like what is going on? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1467.8s)]
*  Well, so I wrote I had adjustments for game two that I did before [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1472.96s)]
*  Before the comeback and [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1478.72s)]
*  The two adjustments I had for Indy was Indy has to run more which I think they're gonna do anyway [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1480.52s)]
*  I think they're gonna look at the tape and realize like we're not we weren't aggressive enough off rebounds [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1485.2s)]
*  The other one's interesting because his stats weren't good. And this is just an eye test [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  And that isn't backed up by any actual information. I [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1495.72s)]
*  let I thought math or and seemed athletically comfortable in this game and [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1500.24s)]
*  I'm intrigued by what his upside is for them because okc is so fast and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1504.48s)]
*  So athletic and they're just at warp speed and I just thought he looked comfortable in the chaos in a way that I'm wondering [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1510.0s)]
*  Are we gonna hear from him in this series? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1518.28s)]
*  With one of those game when one of those games, you know when math or I don't have those games where he's like he scored [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1521.28s)]
*  27 points in 22 minutes. I feel like that I feel like he's gonna have one of those [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1526.0s)]
*  So another sort of Rick Carlisle just pushes all the right buttons all the time [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1530.96s)]
*  Toppin looks overwhelmed immediately and has a disastrous two minutes [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1536.8s)]
*  Some coaches would be like it's just not not gonna be his night [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1541.84s)]
*  Like I'll just try him one more stint if it doesn't work out and like yes, we need you [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1544.76s)]
*  Matheran I thought started the game also really bad [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1549.56s)]
*  He had a couple offensive possessions where he hesitated and the whole flow stopped and Carlisle yanked him quickly after one of those [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1552.92s)]
*  Possessions and then put him back in the game [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1559.28s)]
*  I thought we I thought we might not see him again after that substitution [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  Put him back in the game. It's not like he did anything amazing. He was one for five [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  But I thought you got to the line [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1568.8400000000001s)]
*  For four free throws and just looked again [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1571.48s)]
*  comfortable and [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1574.0s)]
*  He liked the speed [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1575.4s)]
*  The Pacers when you talk to their people [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1577.2800000000002s)]
*  They view they view these series like holistically they are they are thinking [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1580.88s)]
*  They they try to hold adjustments in the bag for future games instead of panicking and overdoing it right away [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1585.72s)]
*  Like even if they're big underdogs like they are here [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1592.72s)]
*  They're sort of playing in their head as if this is gonna be a really long series and I think [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1595.32s)]
*  Trusting those guys to keep playing is like we're gonna need them at some point in the series turned out they needed them today [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1600.0s)]
*  It's good [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1606.1200000000001s)]
*  Thomas Bryant even comes in and scores five points corner three at the end of the third quarter like just okay [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1607.76s)]
*  His corner three is starting to look ray Allen esque. He's one where I think it's going in [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1613.68s)]
*  Yeah, when when Thomas Bryan sign up lots more discussed we're gonna take a break for the podcast [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1618.36s)]
*  We'll keep going on the on the YouTube here [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1622.9599999999998s)]
*  So Halliburton, yes [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1627.3999999999999s)]
*  What a roller coaster ride for this guy from a big picture standpoint. I think if they lose this game by 1215 [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1630.32s)]
*  Halliburton becomes on the TV shows the next day the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1637.1999999999998s)]
*  Where's Tyrese Halliburton? He's got a step up [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  It's the finals you love the step, but you love the step up step up guy [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1644.44s)]
*  And because I thought he was a little tentative [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1649.2s)]
*  But and sometimes he's tentative because he's trying to fill out the game in this case [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1651.72s)]
*  he's going against like an actual fish tank of piranha and [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1655.96s)]
*  I think going from the speed of what he was going against against the Knicks and just trying to hunt Jalen Brunson in [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1660.0400000000002s)]
*  Towns for two weeks and then you see this team and you're like I [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1665.96s)]
*  Who do I hunt I? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1670.16s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1672.92s)]
*  But I I thought he kept tossing the car keys to Nemhard in smart ways [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1674.76s)]
*  He didn't you know, they had all these turnovers [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1680.72s)]
*  I think he only had three a lot of the turnovers were Turner and Neesmith and then those three top in and [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1683.1200000000001s)]
*  McConnell had a couple but I don't know I expect him to be a little more assertive maybe in [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1689.44s)]
*  Game two as well. I think they have some moves left. I think they have bullets in the arsenal for the next game [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1695.68s)]
*  Well when you turn the ball over 25 times right you just like like that's one bullet in the arsenals [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1700.5800000000002s)]
*  Just don't do stuff like that. Take care of the ball [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1707.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, so they have five in the second half, which is a good sign too if you're in data [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1709.0600000000002s)]
*  You're like, hey, let's play like we did in the second half another three and I think it was in the fourth quarter [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1712.3000000000002s)]
*  I don't remember which one if we're talking about [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1716.46s)]
*  Just everything's got a flip right kind of plays for you to come back and win a game like this [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1719.22s)]
*  But there was one possession where Neesmith [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1723.5400000000002s)]
*  Almost got stripped of the ball like four times in two seconds season the paint that he's underneath the basket [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1725.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, somehow it didn't lose the ball and found top in for a three and that was also why I don't I think it was [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1732.02s)]
*  In the fourth quarter. I was like, I don't understand. I just don't even understand what's happening anymore and they just keep coming [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1737.18s)]
*  so [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1743.6599999999999s)]
*  There was a lot of talk last season [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1744.86s)]
*  about the sameness of the of the styles and the teams and and [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1748.46s)]
*  By the way, there was talk on your podcast of my podcast about it [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1754.74s)]
*  Are we heading toward a world where everybody has the same offense and plays the same way and it's all about just hunting [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1758.38s)]
*  matchups and shooting threes and having two guys in the corner and four guys standing around and then one guy comes over and sets [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1763.9s)]
*  a pick and that's just gonna be basketball and [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1770.04s)]
*  Ok scene, Indiana one of the reasons I think [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1773.06s)]
*  We had so much trouble wrapping our heads around game one as we're watching it was neither of them play like that [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1775.7s)]
*  Mean okc was a little predictable with the SGA stuff for the most part you have [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1781.3799999999999s)]
*  Okc's playing small ball down the stretch their defense is unlike anything anybody else has [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1786.8999999999999s)]
*  Indiana is just a hodgepodge of I don't know what the fuck is going on and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1792.6999999999998s)]
*  And there's just a natural chaos that both teams have [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1797.06s)]
*  That makes me think maybe this series is gonna be better than we thought [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1801.1799999999998s)]
*  I thought I was gonna be ok scene four or five. I pick five. I think you picked five too. I picked five [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1804.28s)]
*  I'm [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1809.14s)]
*  good for Indiana [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1810.38s)]
*  Not looking good. Ok, see in five. Well, can you figure ok? See on the roads a little bit different, right? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1812.22s)]
*  It's it's gonna be a little more a little more grueling for them [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1818.26s)]
*  I mean could this be like the Philly Lakers series in oh one where [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1822.22s)]
*  Philly steals the game in game one and then the Lakers just dispatch them after that over the next four maybe [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1826.42s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't it right now in the wake of that game. It doesn't feel like that because [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1832.78s)]
*  Oklahoma City looked a little [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1839.82s)]
*  Confused is the wrong word. They just looked a little like [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1844.18s)]
*  Off trying to figure out what to do against Indiana and how this did this different team that plays differently [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1847.34s)]
*  Well, that was a little like the first Denver home game [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1855.1s)]
*  Where they had they controlled the game for 44 minutes and then something weird happened them [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1858.5s)]
*  I also think they were going too slow and they stopped kind of looking [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1862.82s)]
*  Some that this is obviously the all-time example this were the last few years of the Celtics where they would have this lead and they [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1866.26s)]
*  Would change how they played to kind of almost protect the lead and change their identity in four minutes [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1872.3799999999999s)]
*  And I felt a little of that with them. Yeah, I really I want to rewatch the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1878.62s)]
*  The fourth quarter because I think Indiana just began selling out to the paint like we're just gonna make you guys make threes [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1884.62s)]
*  We're not giving you fouls and we're not giving you layups [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1890.02s)]
*  But can you look for a Chet Holmgren is a rewatch in the fourth quarter [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1893.66s)]
*  He's always he's easy to spot when he's on the bench. She's very tall [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1897.78s)]
*  He's the guy on the bench going looking at the coach over and over again going am I going back in? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1901.42s)]
*  I'm like the 19th. I was 19th of the ringer 100 [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1905.98s)]
*  But when you I mean like yes, Oklahoma City [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1908.7s)]
*  I thought play I thought they played too slowly [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1911.14s)]
*  Almost in like a Knicks kind of way where there were a lot of possessions where there was 13 on the shot clock by the time [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1913.58s)]
*  They just walked it up and there's 13 on the shot clock by the time they did anything [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1919.28s)]
*  like [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1922.78s)]
*  like part of the slowness [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1924.02s)]
*  For both teams that you've suggested both teams run more is like these are [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1926.6200000000001s)]
*  Two of the three or four if even that many best transition defense teams in the league like it's hard [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1930.9s)]
*  To run against these teams because they're super fast super athletic and super attentive to just like we're not getting up fast break points [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1936.98s)]
*  But even just taking the ball out of the basket [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1945.18s)]
*  I thought Indiana didn't play Oklahoma City didn't play with enough speed [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1947.38s)]
*  Indiana will play with speed after you make a basket [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1950.94s)]
*  They'll be underneath your basket in in five seconds, and I think both teams have different tools [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1953.6200000000001s)]
*  They can play with to play a little faster, but I thought in Oklahoma City kind of sunk into a [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1959.7s)]
*  Why are you guys walking it up like this? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1964.18s)]
*  Let's go like get your young and fast and that's not how you that's not how you play [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1966.0600000000002s)]
*  I guess that's that's how I was feeling about Oklahoma City [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1969.94s)]
*  For a lot of this game other than when they were forcing a million turnovers like this doesn't feel like how you [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1973.1000000000001s)]
*  It's too deliberate it almost feels a little too deliberate for how you guys usually play one thing about what you said about a [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1979.06s)]
*  Pushing the pace but being nervous about okay, see it was interesting to watch both Albert and them hard [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1988.4199999999998s)]
*  When they're going up the middle and they were constantly doing this [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1993.82s)]
*  Looking left right as they're going full speed because oh, there's no team like okay [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=1997.62s)]
*  See that just comes diving in from the sides, right? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2002.4199999999998s)]
*  It's almost like you're driving on the highway and you just have cars like trying to basically spin you out on your left fender [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2005.46s)]
*  And your right fender as you're driving up [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2011.02s)]
*  But they seem rattled by it or right from behind like if you get a rebound and you start pushing it up like like there [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2013.0600000000002s)]
*  Was one at least one or two where the one was like Dort just comes up right from behind and takes the ball [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2018.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm doing how about Dort by the way when Dort made his two back [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2022.7s)]
*  He made like two consecutive threes one was like in the Nemhar one where he just was like I'm just gonna [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2026.2s)]
*  I saw this and launch a three and then he made another one on the next session. I was like well [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2030.26s)]
*  Tough one for Indiana. Yeah, those are going in go crazy for from three, you know [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2034.7s)]
*  Well, he was gonna be my MVP if they won this game [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2039.9s)]
*  He's also it's funny. I wrote this down and then they lost but Jada Mcganus was like this for Minnesota [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2043.38s)]
*  Dort is the guy for okay see where if he's shooting the ball [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2049.2200000000003s)]
*  Well on top of doing the defensive stuff, you just feel like they're completely unbeatable [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2052.3s)]
*  Of course, they are four steals and five threes for Lou Dort [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2056.58s)]
*  Yes, if his threes plus steals are approaching ten that's probably winning a problem [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2060.9s)]
*  so I googled like a lot of people at halftime the record for turnovers in a finals game and [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2066.86s)]
*  And they we really got it wrong in the broadcast [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2073.3s)]
*  They said it was 34 with the 77 Blazers and it was 36 Golden State game 3 [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2075.9s)]
*  1975 finals a game that they won by 8 [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2081.1s)]
*  And then 36 turnovers and I did a tweet joking about how hey you can do this [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2084.54s)]
*  But I just thought that was so crazy that somebody turned the ball over 36 times and won and now we have a game where somebody [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2089.84s)]
*  Turned it over [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2095.7200000000003s)]
*  24 times and and won. Alright, so what are our fixes for okay see for game two? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2097.1200000000003s)]
*  You had to make picks here play with more just juice in the half court [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2104.52s)]
*  Play with more urgency more speed like I thought I think they could probably [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2110.28s)]
*  Hunt Halliburton a little bit more often a little bit more effectively than they did [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2114.6400000000003s)]
*  but part of that is like [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2119.2400000000002s)]
*  Setting good screens like I don't think they like Halliburton's guys screening for Shay like sometimes you got to hit the guy force them to [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2121.7200000000003s)]
*  Make a decision [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2127.84s)]
*  Force them to help a little bit more [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2129.48s)]
*  and I thought some of their best offense was keep it simple like Shay [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2131.7200000000003s)]
*  going at the Indiana big men on the pick and roll I thought was more effective than [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2137.76s)]
*  Iso ball then getting cute trying to do guard guard screens hunting Halliburton [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2143.28s)]
*  Even though as I say that they could hunt it more effectively [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought like miles Turner did not really have a good game trying to contain Shay on the pick and roll top and couldn't do [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2149.88s)]
*  It even see Ockham on a switch once got burned [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2156.04s)]
*  I thought like that's the simplest offense in the NBA right just have your big guy if there's one on the floor [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2158.16s)]
*  come screen get the other team center involved and and [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2163.92s)]
*  Go from there and I thought Halliburton actually had some success doing that too [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2167.92s)]
*  On the other end those would be two I and and I think the rotations a big one [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2171.88s)]
*  I even think like Ken Rich Williams one minute that was weird [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2177.0800000000004s)]
*  I could I would play him more at the four maybe a little bit did not did not have the AJ Mitchell first half stint [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2179.92s)]
*  In my notes didn't see that one coming. Not really sure why that happened, but it was just just weird [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2187.1200000000003s)]
*  Did you notice it's always hard to tell through the TV? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2193.6400000000003s)]
*  But sometimes you can kind of tell crowd got super tight the last three minutes [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2196.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you can tell you could you could feel it. That was a we've never won the title. What's going on? Oh [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2200.88s)]
*  God and it's interesting because I went to game one of the 2012 series against Lebron and the heat [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2206.88s)]
*  Which if I remember correctly, okay see I [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2213.6800000000003s)]
*  Thought should have won that game. Maybe they did win the game one of those first two games the rank game [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2217.1600000000003s)]
*  One game one game one day one game two is the game you're talking about where Durant gets fouled up [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2221.54s)]
*  I was sitting where he got fouled. Miami's up to yeah, but yeah that crowd is [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2226.72s)]
*  Absolutely loud your head hurts when you leave [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2232.52s)]
*  But they can also get a little tight well, and don't you think some of that is also like those fans know [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2236.52s)]
*  This team has done this to every team they faced in the playoffs so far like if we let this game get away [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2243.96s)]
*  We've seen Indiana in this movie before like it's danger a it's dangerous [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2249.6s)]
*  They're never out of the game and be if we give them momentum with the home loss like that's who the hell knows what can [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2254.52s)]
*  Happen well, what's interesting big picture, Indiana who if they just get swept in the finals [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2259.08s)]
*  Just historically legacy wise you're like, oh, yeah, that was a weird season [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2265.28s)]
*  Indiana beat Milwaukee then they shot Cleveland [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2269.88s)]
*  They had all those comebacks and they beat the Knicks and they fired Tibbs and then they got killed in the finals [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2272.8s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of remember that team now. It's like remember that Indiana team [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2278.24s)]
*  Holy shit, you'd like chop their head off decapitate them to get them out of the way [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2282.78s)]
*  What an easy finals team that was I mean some someone some like Kevin Pelton stats [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2288.0600000000004s)]
*  Kind of person is gonna have to go through the database and study [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2295.1000000000004s)]
*  Is this the greatest clutch shooting season last two minutes last greatest clutch playoffs? Yeah [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2299.0s)]
*  Okay, but but even a regular season he was incredible too [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2304.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like he just is Halliburton is making all the shot [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2307.34s)]
*  We didn't you know what we did not hammer enough we kind of hammered around it. We didn't hammer it enough [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2309.94s)]
*  Jdub and Shet 8 of 28 combined from the floor [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2315.26s)]
*  Check check made two baskets the entire game [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2319.38s)]
*  The first was to my earlier point about keep it simple pick and pop pump fake drive by miles Turner layup [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2322.12s)]
*  The second was a fast a dunk on a breakdown on a double pick and staggered pick and roll [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2328.94s)]
*  that's just like two two baskets for chat and a to 28 for those two guys like [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2334.42s)]
*  You know that young young guys in game one of the finals when Oklahoma City loses [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2340.06s)]
*  The focus is often on those the second and third guys cuz Shay even when he has an end game [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2344.06s)]
*  And this was like as and as I think a 38 point game could be yeah [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2349.56s)]
*  What's up numbers with some decent level of efficiency and so the spotlight always goes to those guys [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2353.58s)]
*  They weren't good enough. Well the other thing about the finals that we love the rhythm of these games [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2360.06s)]
*  We have game one and this is the only time you have the home game [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2364.06s)]
*  With the with the two days off in [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2367.8s)]
*  Two days talking about it and tomorrow people are gonna go to nem heart and be like you've been going against SGA for a long time [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2370.76s)]
*  What's your secret just dying for him to say one dumb thing you're dag not what? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2376.92s)]
*  You guys are 80 and 18 Chet played 23 minutes heart and Stein played 17 like what are you doing? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2383.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure that was in the press conference right now [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2390.24s)]
*  So a little bit of a pressure and then on top of it you have Indiana which I [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2392.3199999999997s)]
*  think has a great crowd and now they can decide the series at home if they want to and they would be I [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2397.16s)]
*  I think the most improbable finals champ [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2405.0s)]
*  Easy easy, let's not do it. I'm trying to think is there anybody even if you said like this [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2411.16s)]
*  77 Blazers or the 78 Sonics like that era even I [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2416.92s)]
*  Don't know talk about it. They were 20 to 1 win the East before the playoffs [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2421.52s)]
*  This would be the fucking craziest finals if you were a Pacers fan right now and [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2425.36s)]
*  The basketball gods came to you and said hey, we'll make you a deal [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2431.84s)]
*  Would you sign up for 2-2 right now going back to Oklahoma City 2-2 for game 5? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2435.7999999999997s)]
*  Would you take that deal or are you gonna get greedy and think now? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2440.16s)]
*  I don't think I can win if it's 2-2. I think I have to go into the next three. Okay. All right [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2442.6s)]
*  I assume I'm gonna win game 3 and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2447.88s)]
*  Then game 4 will be you assume [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2451.76s)]
*  Okay, see you'll do the thing where they win by 38 and game 2 and one of those games and then we'd be like [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2454.28s)]
*  I India already got the game they got then India win game 3 then game 4 be the series [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2458.96s)]
*  I will say though when you're a big underdog. I [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2464.3s)]
*  really like winning game 1 I [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2467.04s)]
*  Just feel like if the recipe to actually win a series when you're a massive underdog like that [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2469.76s)]
*  Now you only have to win three of the next six [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2476.08s)]
*  By the way, these aren't like outstanding points by me [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2479.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just pointing out you lose that first game and now you have to win for the next six and you're the big underdog [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2481.7599999999998s)]
*  to begin with [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2486.44s)]
*  Conversely, we've seen some teams where they blow that first game in a in a big series or even a finals and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2488.04s)]
*  It turns, you know, we just saw it with the Knicks series [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2495.0s)]
*  You saw it in Orlando Houston in 1995. Sometimes there could be a devastating game one loss and the team can get rattled [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2498.0s)]
*  I think okay, see you'll be fine though because chat will play more [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2505.04s)]
*  J-dub will be better [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2508.68s)]
*  And and I assume they're not gonna get out rebounded by 17 again. Well, this is also where [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2510.68s)]
*  The Denver series and to a lesser extent game four in Minnesota are just massively important for them because they've answered the bell already [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2518.0s)]
*  Every time they face pressure including being down to one to Denver and specifically j-dub [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2526.6s)]
*  Especially j-dub in games game seven of the oak of the Denver series [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2531.24s)]
*  So it's that right this is this is no longer like on unsure [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2535.36s)]
*  It's uncharted because it's the finals [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2539.0s)]
*  But they've kind of done this before and this seems like a team who won't get too high or too low to use a cliche [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2540.56s)]
*  I have down as a winner Nikola Jokic [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2548.8s)]
*  Just cuz I think okay see is just an absolute beast and you think like he takes [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2553.84s)]
*  Takes team USA to the brink almost beats them takes this [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2561.0s)]
*  Okay, see team this seven and then you watch them that first half and you're like, oh my god [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2564.32s)]
*  This team's gonna go 84 and 18 and then maybe he's not as much well [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2568.92s)]
*  we should is by that standard shouldn't shouldn't one of the winners be like Tibbs and [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2572.92s)]
*  And the Knicks by by that standard like, you know, okay, we talked about the Knicks really quick. What's they've got they've got company now [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2577.76s)]
*  You know, let's take a break and we'll do the Knicks really quick [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2583.68s)]
*  Um, Nick's coach drama boy [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2587.22s)]
*  Boy, there's been some buzzing boy. There's been some tidbits and some [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2591.18s)]
*  Some things being talked about. Okay sources are saying stuff. Well, what are they saying? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2595.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't know. It just seems that Nick's team was a lot more dysfunctional than I think [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2601.18s)]
*  They're enhanced and heard [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2605.7s)]
*  Rumors and but man this little games a game of fronzie over there [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2607.98s)]
*  Dysfunctional well, okay [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2612.86s)]
*  So are you talking about players or like when you say game of Thrones you usually mean, you know the upper echelon of management [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2613.8199999999997s)]
*  question for you, so Jaylen Brunson's dad is one of the coaches of the team and worked with tips for a long time and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2620.1s)]
*  Danta D. Vincenzo was yelling at him for some reason in that first home game and seemed like he had felt betrayed by him [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2626.5s)]
*  And there's always rumors that he had an outsized voice with Leon and all those dudes [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2632.38s)]
*  If you're the next coach [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2637.86s)]
*  Do you want your own staff or do you want to inherit this staff that [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2640.1s)]
*  Felt like it got a little game of thrones II down the stretch there. Okay, so [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2644.1s)]
*  Every coach wants his own staff and there are some coaches [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2649.26s)]
*  There are some coaches for whom that's been a deal-breaker when they are told during the hiring process [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2652.54s)]
*  Well, you got to keep this guy or you got to keep this guy. I got Kate these two guys [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2656.86s)]
*  It's either it has been either a deal-breaker or begrudgingly [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2659.9s)]
*  Accepted by a coach who really wants a particular job with an eye on like alright [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2663.86s)]
*  I'll give it a year and then I'll exercise my power [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2667.7799999999997s)]
*  This is obviously a much different situation since he is the father of the franchise player [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2670.66s)]
*  and I think that is a discussion that has to include lots of different parties to come to a [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2675.66s)]
*  If a change is made, I think a lot of different people have to be involved in that [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2681.9799999999996s)]
*  I don't when you talk to people around the league [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2685.9399999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of skepticism that there would be a change made because he is Jaylen Brunson's father [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2688.18s)]
*  But I think skepticism is under rating it. I think people think he will be on the bench [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2694.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of what I meant. Yeah [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2700.2599999999998s)]
*  But you know dysfunctional is like it's a strong it's a strong word [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2703.58s)]
*  80 it's just like every team's got its stuff, right? Every team's got its stuff in the locker room, but a lot of leaks [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2709.54s)]
*  lot of [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2717.18s)]
*  Renewing the story from the moment the season ended all the way through that athletic thing that we talked about in our podcast that came out [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2719.06s)]
*  Almost right afterwards the scapegoating and that was really interesting. I've been following that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2726.9s)]
*  That was cat cat was kind of hit hard and that one in tips right called it out [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2732.5s)]
*  That night when I read the story was like, alright, this is notable that these are the two scapegoats. Let's see how it goes [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2738.2599999999998s)]
*  I'll be interested to see if [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2743.78s)]
*  Cat will be the other domino that falls with this but would who wants this job is [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2745.46s)]
*  I assumed Johnny Bryant was gonna get it because the Sun said there were two people left him the guy who got the job [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2751.62s)]
*  Jordan odd give Jordan. I love who apparently is married is somebody named Jordan. Did you hear this? I [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2760.7000000000003s)]

*  Um [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2772.42s)]
*  But uh, so Johnny Brian how many names how many names could you do that with? Okay, you know have not made the same [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2773.62s)]
*  Yeah ready. We have to be like Jordan Kelly [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2779.9s)]
*  Yeah, Kelly's a good one [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2782.9s)]
*  Anyway, Alex. Yeah, Alex is a good one [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2785.1s)]
*  But uh, so when Johnny was in the final two and then all of a sudden the other guy got it [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2788.54s)]
*  I just assumed he was the the next thing. I don't think being gunned a that name got flown around but he's which one [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2792.66s)]
*  Jeff he's friends with uh, yeah, I don't obviously really close with tips. I don't see I'm like cool [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2800.1s)]
*  Yeah, you shanked my guy. I'd love to take the job everything he's ever said [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2805.34s)]
*  publicly and privately would cut against him taking that job [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2810.42s)]
*  So who's left the only name that didn't really get mentioned that I was surprised. Oh [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2814.5s)]
*  You're excited [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2819.8199999999997s)]
*  Taylor Jenkins is a good coach. I [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2821.74s)]
*  Watched a lot of Memphis games going man. They have a really good coach [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2824.18s)]
*  And he's just kind of sitting there everyone was talking Mike Malone, but to me that that just feels like you're running back a different [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2827.54s)]
*  version of tips [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2833.78s)]
*  Taylor Jenkins I thought he you could make a pretty [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2835.78s)]
*  Fair case with him that he [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2839.7s)]
*  Had a really tough job the last couple years. He's a very good coach Taylor Jenkins is a very good coach [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2842.42s)]
*  Memphis to New York as a market and as [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2849.06s)]
*  Expectations faced is about as big of a jump as you can make in you go from Chris Vernon to 40 Chris Vernon's [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2852.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean this James Dolan know who Taylor Jenkins is [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2859.46s)]
*  Like start there like I'm not even being facetious. Like is he aware that that's a coach? I don't know not [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2863.5s)]
*  I'm not sure he's hiring the next coach. I think this is a Leon thing [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2870.54s)]
*  But but he'll he's got a little sign off on it [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2875.06s)]
*  Who do you think's gonna be the next coach I have no earthly idea I mean I you know, I've heard rumblings of [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2878.54s)]
*  Like they'd maybe they want an ex-player [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2886.54s)]
*  An ex NBA player. I don't know if that's I don't know if that's true [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2890.2999999999997s)]
*  My favorite is Ron our tester in his hat in the ring was my number one [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2894.74s)]
*  He really wants to coach. He really wants to coach. I'm pretty sure he's not gonna get it [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2898.74s)]
*  I don't I see come up on like the the list of like, you know [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2903.74s)]
*  They have the 20 best odds to coach the New York Knicks where it's like the bottom one is the last one is like [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2908.46s)]
*  Stephen a Smith like they get real Joe House is right above it. Yeah, I [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2913.2599999999998s)]
*  Thought the name I thought Frank Vogel might come up just because he's a New York guy [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2919.58s)]
*  But he's you know, he's been in a lot of places now in a short amount of time. Look the one he got ish beard [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2924.1s)]

*  You [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2936.78s)]
*  Boosted his I'm gonna get more involved [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2938.46s)]
*  Watch out. I'm gonna get Ishby. I'm gonna get more involved [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2941.5800000000004s)]
*  I wasn't involved enough and I'm gonna get more involved like it wasn't his idea to throw Cam Johnson and then Kevin Durant [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2944.7400000000002s)]
*  Trade and like one more pick and just be like you know, you're loving the ish beer [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2950.6600000000003s)]
*  You got him on your podcast right off the bat and I had no idea [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2954.3s)]
*  I was gonna be a specials. Well, I think I think he's not he's not gonna come back [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2957.1800000000003s)]
*  I actually was I was gonna do this with you in the pod the most hilarious owner of each decade [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2960.94s)]
*  Because he's clearly halfway there the back was locked it down in the 2010s [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2966.02s)]
*  So that gives coming in for a late a late 20. That's the thing. You can't have a vet. You can't count him out [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2971.02s)]
*  You can't [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2976.46s)]
*  You just can't he's I'm not saying ish be hasn't locked up yet, but he's he's in the lead and he's feeling good [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2978.94s)]
*  But the back, you know, who knows but Vivek won last decade and then I think probably Dolan won [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2985.2200000000003s)]
*  In the 2000s with all the crazy shit he did to he's he's not hilarious though. It says it doesn't fit him [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2991.02s)]
*  Doesn't who would you have in the 2000s server? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=2999.82s)]
*  No, nothing. They're they're malicious people. They're not hilarious server. Yeah, that's illegal stuff [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3003.26s)]
*  Like well, we didn't know that in the 2000s. Oh civil litigation. Anyway, no that was later [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3009.54s)]
*  I'm saying 2000s 2000s when he basically hired Steve Kearns like you have to get into luxury tracks trade all our picks [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3014.06s)]
*  I mean [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3021.66s)]
*  He you know what it is. It was Cuban [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3023.98s)]
*  from a hilarious standpoint some of the stuff it where he was sitting on the bench and [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3026.86s)]
*  Remember the time he ran on the court during the fight to break up the court and then realized he shouldn't be on the court [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3030.7000000000003s)]
*  He had some funny stuff [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3035.5s)]
*  Ishby is the clear winner in the 2020. So I mean, I guess we can't blame [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3037.34s)]
*  Will be can't blame but it wasn't hilarious [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3042.78s)]
*  Glenn Taylor for just overseeing the entire David Kahn [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3045.62s)]
*  Experience in Minnesota, but you know, this is why you're the best not only that but the he lost four picks would for Joe Smith [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3049.22s)]
*  But he was ever hilarious was ever hilarious [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3058.9799999999996s)]
*  He called as we had in the Celtic City doc [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3061.9399999999996s)]
*  He called wick to congratulate him and win in the 2008 title because he was trading him Kevin Garnett [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3064.62s)]
*  He had Kevin McHale as a coach and a GM at the same time and flip Sauners. Yeah, it's Glenn Taylor. It's a great call [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3071.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, wait, wait, wait, let's go back to the next we didn't like who do you think is gonna get the job? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3078.74s)]
*  I'd find it hard to believe Johnny Bryant's gonna be the head coach the more I looked at it and thought about it [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3085.06s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like he's experienced enough. This is one of the biggest jobs in the league [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3090.4199999999996s)]
*  I would bet on Taylor Jenkins Frank Bogle Mike Malone one of those guys who at least has been in some situations [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3094.7s)]
*  What about the what about the? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3101.4599999999996s)]
*  Can we trade for your coach Gambit that has been mentioned with email doka and Jason Kidd any of that interesting [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3103.9s)]
*  Well, why would Houston trade in made doka like just to throw him out. He's I [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3110.78s)]
*  Don't get any rid of him. That's ridiculous. I agree and I don't think he would leave [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3115.86s)]
*  It's a great situation even with the East being so much worse in the West [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3119.54s)]
*  It's a great situation and also like I know how Houston's GM or fell stone [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3122.62s)]
*  Negotiates would just be like you don't even have enough. You don't have enough [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3128.02s)]
*  Three first round picks you don't even have that the kid one is interesting to me [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3131.14s)]
*  Yeah, because he's I wouldn't think they didn't love the Luca one. I wouldn't take my eyes off it [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3136.86s)]
*  That's all I that's all I would say now. I wouldn't I wouldn't take I wouldn't disqualify it [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3142.14s)]
*  I wouldn't take my eyes off it in part because as you and I are batting it around [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3146.18s)]
*  We can't find another candidate. That's like oh, that's [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3149.2599999999998s)]
*  That makes a ton of sense for a team that has said in its press release announcing the firing of Tom Thibodeau [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3152.46s)]
*  We are a championship roster at least we believe we are that's the pressure that's the expectations [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3158.0s)]
*  That's why it's hard to imagine a first-time head coach walking into that job. I [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3164.0s)]
*  Apologize to the friend who sent me this. Oh boy that I can't remember their name [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3170.6s)]
*  What kind of friend do you but? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3176.36s)]
*  Made the point Tibbs would have been the greatest Atlanta Hawks coach and [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3180.2000000000003s)]
*  That the best outcome would have been a Quinn Snyder for Tibbs trade [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3184.56s)]
*  Over firing Tibbs because if you put Tibbs on Atlanta [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3188.72s)]
*  He basically just could have run the Knicks offense with Trey as Jalen Brunson [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3191.76s)]
*  but then had all this defense and all these wings and a Kong Wu is the shop Walker and [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3196.2s)]
*  Just done the Tibbs with that team and Trey could have shot [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3201.0s)]
*  36 times I again, I really apologize to my friend who texted this but I thought it was great and then Quinn Snyder on the [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3204.16s)]
*  Knicks bench [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3210.2s)]
*  With the red glasses just just being weird and he's gotta get blue [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3211.24s)]
*  Glasses then blue glasses are orange glass right dark blue glasses. I thought that was a really good one [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3215.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I think it's a guy with some pedigree the Malone would be a weird one though because he's a little gruff like [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3220.12s)]
*  Tibbs was but [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3226.08s)]
*  The guy won a title two years ago [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3227.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, so that's a great. This is a point [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3230.9199999999996s)]
*  I wanted to make and I should admit it about Tibbs and I'm gonna make it again on my podcast this weekend [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3232.9199999999996s)]
*  Michael Malone's a great name to bring up Mike Budenholz is a great name to bring up not for this job [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3237.6000000000004s)]
*  But for this for this purpose Frank Vogel is a great name to bring up not necessarily for this job, but for this purpose [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3242.76s)]
*  The idea that Tibbs is not a championship coach that you need a different coach to take your team [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3250.28s)]
*  He's the floor razor who can only take your team so far [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3254.9s)]
*  I think there's some merit to the general idea of Tibbs is that because he is [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3258.1000000000004s)]
*  Indisputably an incredible floor razor incredible and I don't think he's like a Carlisle spoh level [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3265.0s)]
*  quarter for quarter minute for minute [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3272.44s)]
*  Adjustment guy that's your playoff dream coach, right? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3275.36s)]
*  But I don't think any of those other guys were either and like that's why Mike Budenholz are got fired in Milwaukee [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3278.52s)]
*  He was too slow to adjust blah blah blah Michael Malone was never thought of as like this incredible [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3285.54s)]
*  Wizard of adjustments and all this stuff and those guys won championships like if you have the right talent and [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3290.96s)]
*  If you have the right talent right year right circumstances like yeah [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3298.96s)]
*  I should have been clear about this like Tom Thibodeau can absolutely win an NBA championship [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3302.36s)]
*  Even if he is more of a floor razor than a ceiling razor [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3306.88s)]
*  He can he's so good at getting your floor so high that he can get you into that spot [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3310.16s)]
*  He can absolutely win a championship and like that's why that Michael Malone Mike Budenholz [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3316.4s)]
*  But was like on thin ice [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3320.52s)]
*  Several times in Milwaukee mostly because of the idea that he was not as good of a playoff coach as someone like Eric [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3323.7599999999998s)]
*  Spoelstra who kind of exposed him a couple times and he won the championship. That's all [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3329.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it seems like it was time for tips to go in New York after five years [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3334.3199999999997s)]
*  Didn't use flow felt like it felt like the the the core guys [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3339.16s)]
*  Were good [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3344.16s)]
*  Moving on with him and you lose the core guys [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3345.8s)]
*  It's it's a wrap in the NBA and that's why the longest tenured coaches in the league go back to the 2020 [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3348.28s)]
*  Can we just the core guys? I know cats had experience with Tibbs before maybe so maybe this is maybe that was rocky from the [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3353.2400000000002s)]
*  Gecko, I'm sure [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3360.5200000000004s)]
*  Fine now, how do we know in a no-be like kind of just got there, you know? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3361.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not like he's been there all five years with Tibbs [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3366.78s)]
*  It's not like Towns has been there all five years with Tibbs or heart has been there all five [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3369.5600000000004s)]
*  Briges just got there. It's not like they've all been there [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3373.44s)]
*  But like four years of just like oh my god another shoot around with Tibbs like, you know, it's it's not like they've been there that long [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3376.4s)]
*  Seemed a little [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3384.3599999999997s)]
*  Seemed a little gamey. That's why I flagged it for you in April when you jerk backwards [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3386.44s)]
*  And I still like they made the conference finals [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3391.7599999999998s)]
*  They did and the thing is a lot of it has to come down to [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3394.3599999999997s)]
*  How do you view those first two games against Boston because they were they were before Tatum Tours Achilles [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  They were about to go up 3-1 probably win that series and you would think like wow [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3405.52s)]
*  What a feather in their cap that they're gonna knock the defending champions out pretty honestly until that injury [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3410.96s)]
*  Unless you think the first two games were about Boston just were like 75% choke [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3417.3199999999997s)]
*  25% comeback and not 50-50 [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3423.4399999999996s)]
*  Can I give you 90-10? Yeah, whatever. I was trying to be nice to the Knicks. I [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3426.28s)]
*  Was on a tech start about this two days ago because I was looking at the third and fourth quarter box scores from game one [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3431.32s)]
*  And getting mad all over again [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3438.44s)]
*  To Celtics took I think it was 34 shots in the second half and 27 of them were threes [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3441.84s)]
*  they took 20 20 shots in the third quarter with a 20-point lead at various points and [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3448.96s)]
*  19 of them were threes they took zero free throws and the whole thing is like after watching what Indiana did to the Knicks [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3454.84s)]
*  To think that the Celtics just walked the ball up and just jacked up threes and that was their offense and what a giant favor [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3461.96s)]
*  They did for the Knicks and both of those games and then the Knicks hung around they grabbed the game much like Indiana today [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3468.76s)]
*  But to me that was a Boston [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3473.88s)]
*  Just an absolute strategy collapse where you're just like it was the basically the opposite. OkC tonight [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3476.44s)]
*  We're ok. See it's like actually we're gonna change our lineup. We think maybe this would be a little better for us [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3482.36s)]
*  Boston was like we do this. This is all we do [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3486.7200000000003s)]
*  We don't care who we're playing. This is our formula [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3490.1600000000003s)]
*  We're never gonna deviate from it [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3493.06s)]
*  And then you see how easy it was to just push the ball in the Knicks [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3494.6000000000004s)]
*  Get towns or Brunson in any sort of switch keep running run after run after made baskets [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3498.52s)]
*  Just keep pushing the pace on them and they didn't do any of it and they had the same kind of players [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3504.1200000000003s)]
*  Indiana has better versions of them in some cases [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3508.44s)]
*  Anyway, I [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3511.48s)]
*  Have the I what's Utah up to? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3514.3599999999997s)]
*  Rind down as a topic [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3518.68s)]
*  Jazz at 12 15 a.m [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3521.9599999999996s)]
*  This is my last one cuz I haven't seen you since they hired Austin age [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3524.2799999999997s)]
*  Gave him the car keys then Austin age is like we're not gonna be tanking anymore. That got my attention. I [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3528.7999999999997s)]
*  Have my eye on them. Everybody's telling me to have my eye on Toronto [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3535.12s)]
*  That's been the new catchy thing to say this [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3538.84s)]
*  Toronto nobody loves that more than the Raptors. They're in the discourse. Yeah, watch out for Toronto. It's like what am I watching out for? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3542.12s)]
*  Well, they're gonna do they're all the Scotty Barnes and other picks for Yanis. Milwaukee's not doing that. What are they gonna do? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3549.16s)]
*  Why are you disqualifying that for Milwaukee? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3556.36s)]
*  I'm not doing that. I'm keeping honest if it's Scotty Barnes and some picks for Yanis. Thanks. I'm gonna keep you honest [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3560.64s)]
*  Thanks. Anyway, I'll keep one of the 20 best players ever at age 30. Thank you [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3567.04s)]
*  Well, okay, so what do you want to talk about the Utah Jazz [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3573.56s)]
*  We should we do a deep dive on can't a George like what are we doing here? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3575.68s)]
*  I'm just wondering are they gonna get frisky over the next three weeks? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3579.32s)]
*  So do I have to keep my eye on this? So you're you love this idea of [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3582.7999999999997s)]
*  you love this idea of [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3587.7999999999997s)]
*  Marketing for Paul George and number three. That's like you're that's like your little pet. It's like a little pet over here [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3590.52s)]
*  You love that one. I have it in a cage [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3596.0s)]
*  I feed it some cage free eggs and some some spring water and I try to try to grow it [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3598.2s)]
*  I don't even know if that makes sense for Philly [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3604.42s)]
*  But I just wonder if Philly's looking at trades like that with the third pick [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3606.6s)]
*  I hate that trade for everybody involved. I think I do too. I just thought it was a fun trade [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3610.76s)]
*  I don't know. What are you doing with marketing and Joel and be together? I don't know what that is [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3615.72s)]
*  If you tell me I'm the Sixers I know I'm the jazz I can reroute Paul George somewhere else for something less damaging to [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3620.44s)]
*  My cap sheet for the next three years and I get the number three pick then it starts to be [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3627.64s)]
*  somewhat interesting me but like marketing is pretty good and [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3631.76s)]
*  The Paul George contract is not so good. Although I think it'll get rehabbed in this year [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3635.1600000000003s)]
*  I think we'll think differently a Paul of Paul George in about six [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3639.6800000000003s)]
*  Can I make the case for why I would think about this if I'm Utah? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3642.1600000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't do it if I was Philly [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3644.6800000000003s)]
*  But if I'm Utah and I have two two stabs at a top five pick in this draft [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3646.16s)]
*  Which I think has a really especially the top five has a chance. There might be somebody really special [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3650.72s)]
*  Edge comb Trey Johnson Harper like one of those guys but ended up being a top [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3656.3199999999997s)]
*  Ten or fifteen guy in the league, maybe two of them. Who knows? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3662.64s)]
*  And from Utah I get two swings at that Apple if I can trade keep my fifth pick and trade into the [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3666.08s)]
*  Top three, but I thought would not be the trade I did if I was Philly [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3673.08s)]
*  If I would try to do three and Paul George, I would be shopping that around [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3676.12s)]
*  They I would have offered that to Jalen Brown for Jalen Brown right now [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3680.56s)]
*  well, that's okay, so you're in the right age range then because [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3684.72s)]
*  for Philly [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3689.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I have to make decisions at this level [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3690.8399999999997s)]
*  Based on a timetable that is not Joel Embiid's timetable [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3694.7599999999998s)]
*  like I that's that's why if I really like the guys are available at three and those guys have studied the draft a [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3697.9s)]
*  Thousand times more than I have if they hate if they don't like those guys. It's a different conversation if I like them [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3703.44s)]
*  I as a steward of that franchise. I could no longer mortgage major pieces of our future [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3708.98s)]
*  For the idea that I can win a title with Joel Embiid. I just can't do it. I think you're right [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3715.36s)]
*  I think that's the right I think you have max number three. It's obvious like I just don't know if I don't know if [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3719.48s)]
*  So that's the thing one office is wired that way though [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3726.92s)]
*  So that's the thing about Utah and frisky that that your little pet trade is at least the right idea of them being frisky [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3729.48s)]
*  Because otherwise like what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go out and trade for Trey Young or something [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3735.88s)]
*  Like why is that interesting to me if I'm Utah like what I'm why am I cashing in ships when Austin says? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3739.88s)]
*  They're not tanking anymore [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3745.2400000000002s)]
*  It's it they don't have to tank to tank like they could just play all the players that they have on their roster [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3747.52s)]
*  Maybe trade Sexton for a first or whatever [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3754.64s)]
*  Whoever gets you a first out of the Sexton Collins Clarkson group and just don't do what you did last year [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3757.3999999999996s)]
*  Where everyone has injuries that pop up mysteriously every third game or like last 40 games or whatever [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3763.7599999999998s)]
*  Just play your roster the West the West is so good that you'll finish 14th or 15th in the West anyway [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3769.7599999999998s)]
*  And you'll have organically tanked and everybody won't be so goddamn miserable anymore. That's all [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3775.64s)]
*  especially will Hardy [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3781.0s)]
*  Not a drinker, but I'm gonna be starting if we're gonna suck again cuz I can't do this a third year [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3784.8399999999997s)]
*  But at least for will Hardy sake he has leveraged their own misery into like I think he's been extended 15 times [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3789.68s)]
*  40 now, uh [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3798.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think you ties the food pick and that might end up being a really good player so maybe they're good but Utah [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3801.52s)]
*  Utah and Toronto I think are the two that people seem to be whispering about that [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3808.0s)]
*  And then Atlanta I think is just interesting in general. I don't even know who would want to try young San Antonio [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3813.5200000000004s)]
*  I think keeps to at least that's that's the word [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3819.0400000000004s)]
*  but there's [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3823.44s)]
*  There's been a lot of KD stuff this week a lot of Katie's and that seemed like a possible home for him [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3825.0s)]
*  I still like towns for Katie is employed to I by the way one of my favorite things has been like how every time anyone [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3830.36s)]
*  Says that Katie's almost a lock to get traded [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3836.28s)]
*  It gets aggregated as if it's some big story like Katie's getting traded [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3839.56s)]
*  But yeah, they promise not Katie's not gonna be on the Suns next year [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3843.12s)]
*  Like we could we could put that one to bed. Just wait to see what the trade is [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3846.6s)]
*  Well the stuff the stuff that was this week about how Bradley Beale [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3850.08s)]
*  They're stuck with them. They might have to buy him out [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3854.32s)]
*  He's got two years left. I think at like 53 and 57. My guess is they're not gonna buy him out [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3858.08s)]
*  Anyway, we'll see what happens. We have plenty of time to talk about this [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3864.92s)]
*  So we're gonna be doing pods next week in in the great state, Indianapolis [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3867.88s)]
*  That's right baby nap town. We're coming. Do people call it nap town anymore? I [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3872.82s)]
*  Jalen Rose does that was [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3877.0s)]
*  That's good enough for me, you know, I just gonna throw this out here you would know this [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3879.84s)]
*  You would not necessarily know this but you would know how how realistic of a question [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3884.2000000000003s)]
*  This is I asked some of the Pacers people this when they were in New York up three one last week [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3888.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so a near and dear question to your heart and probably one that you've thought about and know the background of better than I do [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3894.08s)]
*  Do we get a legend appearance in Indiana for a game for one of the home finals games? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3901.2s)]
*  I mean if you want to get the crowd involved to bring the house down, I think it's a good idea [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3905.7999999999997s)]
*  He lives in Indiana. Why wouldn't he? Well, he's good. He lives in Florida a lot. I don't know where he is [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3911.7599999999998s)]
*  Day to day right now, but I know he's got a place in somewhere in Florida [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3918.16s)]
*  If I'm the Pacers and I and it's one one heading into game three [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssP_fIV6mI&t=3922.2s)]
