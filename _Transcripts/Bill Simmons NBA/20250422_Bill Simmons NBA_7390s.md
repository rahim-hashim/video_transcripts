# Ageless LeBron, Kawhi’s Crazy Career and NFL Draft Burning Questions | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok)
*  Alright, I am taping just the top part of the pod here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=0.0s)]
*  It is 10 o'clock at night, almost. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=28.9s)]
*  Just got home from Lakers, Minnesota. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=31.18s)]
*  Game two played in Los Angeles, California at the Crypto. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=33.339999999999996s)]
*  It used to be called Staples. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=36.66s)]
*  I still call it Staples. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=38.739999999999995s)]
*  It's Crypto. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=39.9s)]
*  A must-win game for the Lakers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=40.9s)]
*  They did win. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  It was a weird one. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=44.46s)]
*  I really wanted to have like some sort of awesome take to play off of or some grand [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=45.459999999999994s)]
*  thing to say. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=49.5s)]
*  And I could do the first take thing and just list all the guys who need to step up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=50.5s)]
*  Nazred, Nazred, nine points. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=57.5s)]
*  He's got to step up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=59.62s)]
*  Dante, Vincenzo, four points. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=62.26s)]
*  You got to step up. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=64.5s)]
*  I'm not going to do that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=66.22s)]
*  I have two takeaways. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=67.1s)]
*  One slightly negative, one slightly positive, other than the Lakers were supposed to win [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=68.58s)]
*  tonight. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=72.86s)]
*  They took care of business. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=74.58s)]
*  Their defense was way, way, way better. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=75.86s)]
*  Their energy was way, way, way better. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  And if you look at the box score, big minutes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=80.9s)]
*  Donchich, 42 minutes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=85.26s)]
*  Reeves, 42 minutes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=88.46s)]
*  LeBron James, is he 40 yet? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=91.3s)]
*  39? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=93.1s)]
*  Somewhere in that vicinity. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=94.34s)]
*  39 minutes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=96.7s)]
*  Rui Hachimura, who got hit in the face. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=98.22s)]
*  He's wearing like a Batman mask. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=99.94s)]
*  34 minutes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=101.26s)]
*  Phinney Smith, 38 minutes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=102.62s)]
*  So they basically did a Tibbs on this game. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=104.5s)]
*  And the positive comment here is just the LeBron stuff is just incredible. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=108.18s)]
*  21-11 and seven. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=113.3s)]
*  Big energy plays, big defense. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=116.7s)]
*  And I'm watching it going. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=119.38s)]
*  This team is in basically the same situation the Warriors are in, where they're going to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=121.58s)]
*  have to go small to be truly effective. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=125.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=127.74s)]
*  The Warriors have Draymond, who is this undersized center. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=128.3s)]
*  You can kind of get away with it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=131.9s)]
*  And they're always at their best when Draymond is at the five and they can surround him with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=133.3s)]
*  shooters and stuff and do that thing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=137.34s)]
*  This Lakers team by default is at their best when they're basically playing LeBron and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=140.18s)]
*  Rui as the quote unquote centers, even though they're not centers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=144.26s)]
*  And they're just scrambling, hustling on defense. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=147.1s)]
*  And they're just trying to protect the rim. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=149.38s)]
*  They're trying to get away with the physicality that you can get away with when you have LeBron [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=151.14s)]
*  James and Luca Doncic on your team. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  And just be physical from the gate and just keep scrambling, keep trying, keep trying, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=156.74s)]
*  keep having energy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=160.62s)]
*  And LeBron was playing so freaking hard. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=162.22s)]
*  I don't know if it came across the same way on TV, but he was playing like it was like [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=164.46s)]
*  a game seven when Minnesota was trying to come back there near the end. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=168.14s)]
*  And I was thinking, like, there's been so many iterations of him over the years, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  Like he comes into Cleveland the first six, seven years and it's like, what is this? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=176.82s)]
*  He's Magic Johnson crossed with Dr. J. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  That's what it seemed like. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=187.77999999999997s)]
*  That's where we were headed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  And then it's like, well, wait, he's more of a scorer than we thought. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=189.61999999999998s)]
*  He had that 48 point game against Detroit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=191.98s)]
*  It's like, so the 1.0 version was like, what is this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=194.7s)]
*  Well, wait, there's some, some Jordan stuff here too. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=197.34s)]
*  He's putting up 27, seven and seven every game. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  What is this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=202.5s)]
*  Then he has the four MVPs in five years and basically moves into like queen of the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  chess. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  I remember writing a column about it, like queen of the chessboard where he just masters [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=209.26s)]
*  the ability. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=214.62s)]
*  He's like the Swiss army knife crossed with the best all around offensive player in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  league. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=219.22s)]
*  He could score when he needs to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=219.62s)]
*  He's setting people up. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=220.78s)]
*  He's the best athlete in the league and he's just mastered whatever version that is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=221.82s)]
*  Then he goes to Cleveland, puts on more weight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=227.66s)]
*  Now he's got this weird post-up power game. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=230.98s)]
*  And that's where he kind of moves through the mid 2010s there where it's like, he's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=233.54s)]
*  still the magic, not really dock anymore hybrid. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=239.06s)]
*  It's more like a magic Carl Malone hybrid with a little Jordan thrown in, not that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=242.34s)]
*  much, but really magic in Carl Malone's body using the physicality. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=247.06s)]
*  And that peaked in the 2018 season where he's bully balling anybody. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=251.62s)]
*  And that that's basically where he's been. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  He added the three point shots. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  So like the 3.50 version of this was that Carl Malone magic combo with the three point [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  shot. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=265.38s)]
*  I don't know what this version is. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=266.86s)]
*  And I don't know if he really knows either because they have this incredible offensive [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=268.7s)]
*  player on their team. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=272.74s)]
*  Don't you shoot 31, 12 and nine tonight. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  And all they're doing the whole game is trying to get go bare to get switched on to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=276.98s)]
*  Luca. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=282.02s)]
*  That's the offensive strategy for the most part. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  Where's Conley? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=285.06s)]
*  Can we torture him? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=285.85999999999996s)]
*  Oh, he's not in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=286.82s)]
*  Let's go after go bare. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=287.58s)]
*  And Lebron's over in the corner watching, you know, for, for key possessions. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's really weird to watch in person because he still looks like a Bron. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  He's, he's still as athletic as, you know, as he was in his post prime. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=300.02s)]
*  He can still create his own shot. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  He's still was doing all the same, you know, looking for teammates, all that stuff. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  And then there's times he just seems marginalized. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  You kind of forget he's out there for a couple of possessions and he's figured out [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=315.26s)]
*  always how to be involved in the game. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  Even if he's not involved in the play and he's always moving, he's always hustling, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  he's using his brain and it was really cool to watch. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=325.29999999999995s)]
*  I was really impressed. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=327.97999999999996s)]
*  So for them, he's kind of a little dream on D on defense, I guess, better, better [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=329.34s)]
*  rebounder. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=335.5s)]
*  He had how many rebounds he had tonight? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  11. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=337.58s)]
*  Um, trying to protect the rim every once in a while, and then just keeping energy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=338.54s)]
*  attacking, trying to get offensive rebounds and picking his spots. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=343.46s)]
*  And when they need him, you know, he missed, missed a few wide open shots today, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=347.14s)]
*  which was uncharacteristic for him. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=351.38s)]
*  But, um, I thought it was really cool to watch and whatever balance they found [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=352.82s)]
*  tonight is just how they're going to have to play. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=358.06s)]
*  And I don't know if it's sustainable, but when you think about it, I said this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=359.82s)]
*  before to win three rounds in the playoffs, you have to go 12 and nine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=362.86s)]
*  So can this team be slightly above 500 for three rounds? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  Like, maybe I, I personally don't think either of these teams are [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=370.94000000000005s)]
*  going to win three rounds. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=376.38000000000005s)]
*  I think the it's going to be okay. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=377.42s)]
*  See Clippers, whoever wins that series will be in the finals. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=379.3s)]
*  I still thought that before the playoffs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=382.3s)]
*  I think that now, but when you think of a, what they did tonight on Fandel, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=383.94000000000005s)]
*  that's moved down to minus one 12, the Lakers, Minnesota was, uh, I think they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  were minus one 80 after they won game one. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=394.5s)]
*  So this series is just swinging back and forth. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=396.62s)]
*  And I picked Lakers in seven before the series. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=398.7s)]
*  I will say this, and this leads to my second point, cause I want to talk [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=402.42s)]
*  about Edwards for a second, um, Minnesota has to win this in six. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=405.66s)]
*  I don't, I know, like I said, on Sunday's pod, this team doesn't care where they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=410.3s)]
*  play, um, they're not afraid of anybody. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=415.22s)]
*  And I certainly didn't think they seemed afraid tonight. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=418.18s)]
*  The Lakers just had more energy than they did. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=420.66s)]
*  But this is going to be a tough place to play a game seven because of how good [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=422.46s)]
*  of a, how smart of a player Luca is offensively combined with how smart [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=426.14s)]
*  LeBron is and just the way they can pick their spots, how the energy, the crowd [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=430.5s)]
*  can kind of keep sustaining them and how JJ now realizes I can't play Jackson [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=434.41999999999996s)]
*  Hayes anymore. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=438.46s)]
*  I basically have six guys, six and a half backs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=439.05999999999995s)]
*  Um, I just think it's going to be a hard place to win with when they can always [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=442.26s)]
*  just default to, all right, Luca, where's go bear. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=447.62s)]
*  Let's do that again. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=449.9s)]
*  And I think Minnesota, you know, they have three and four at home. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=450.98s)]
*  The law, the longer the series goes, the Lakers are probably just thinking, can [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  we just somehow get this to seven? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=459.86s)]
*  Um, if we're just going to trade wins, whatever, if we have that seven at home, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=463.14000000000004s)]
*  we're going to have so many advantages. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=466.82s)]
*  They're so hard to officiate to, you know, the way that everybody's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=468.3s)]
*  bouncing off everybody. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=471.66s)]
*  So I still feel like this is seven. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=472.74s)]
*  And if you're telling me these two teams are playing in a game seven for more [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=475.02000000000004s)]
*  to watch tonight, um, I would still slightly tilt toward the Lakers, but, you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=478.66s)]
*  know, would I be surprised if Minnesota wins now? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=483.3s)]
*  So the first take is Lakers did their job today because there was another [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=485.46s)]
*  scenario in this game where they go down on two and it just feels like [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=488.98s)]
*  everything's going to self combust, but that did not happen. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=493.06s)]
*  Second piece, Edwards had a weird game and you know, he's young. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=495.7s)]
*  He's 23, 24. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=501.9s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=503.38s)]
*  And, you know, he had no idea what he was doing. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=504.26s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=506.82s)]
*  And, you know, he had nine assists in the first game and, uh, played [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=507.61999999999995s)]
*  with the energy and pizzazz. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=511.7s)]
*  I think he was hurt. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=513.02s)]
*  Like the shoulder was bugging him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=513.78s)]
*  Basically didn't do anything. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=515.6999999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't shoot in the first quarter as the Lakers are taking a big lead and ends [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=517.18s)]
*  the game. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=521.54s)]
*  He has, I'm going to say zero assists. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=522.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=527.42s)]
*  25.0 assists and sub taking 22 shots, but didn't really shoot in the first quarter. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=528.78s)]
*  This is the last level for him and he's not close yet. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=533.42s)]
*  He might be two years away from me yet. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=536.06s)]
*  And we saw him do it for a stretch last year. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=538.02s)]
*  Um, in those first two rounds where he put together, I think it was seven, eight [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=541.5s)]
*  games where there was just a real mastery of the moment, the game, the other team, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=546.06s)]
*  um, had to set up everybody just had to. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=551.3399999999999s)]
*  Impact the game for four quarters. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  Um, he did not have that tonight. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=556.5s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=560.26s)]
*  Cause I think I, I, as I've said before, 26, 27 is when I really think a guy turns [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=561.5s)]
*  into who they're going to be. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=568.62s)]
*  And right now he is 23 years old. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=569.74s)]
*  He turns 24 on August 5th. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=571.26s)]
*  This is what they need from him. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=574.58s)]
*  If they're going to win three straight rounds, because the conference is just [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=576.9s)]
*  better this year, which is this. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=580.02s)]
*  So you win this series. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=582.22s)]
*  Now you're playing Golden State, probably next round. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=583.34s)]
*  I would guess maybe Houston, if Houston crawls back, but probably Golden State. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=585.54s)]
*  And then after that, you're playing the winner of OKC and I assume the Clippers. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=588.74s)]
*  There's a, there's a sense of the moment slash mastery for him that went a little [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=594.46s)]
*  sideways in the Dallas series and the conference finals last year and sent in [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=599.98s)]
*  this time where, um, the guy that he's going to be that he's not yet, you kind [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=603.38s)]
*  of feel it in games like tonight, he just seemed young to me tonight. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=611.82s)]
*  He seemed like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=614.94s)]
*  a young, awesome player that just seemed good that they won game one and didn't, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=619.38s)]
*  didn't seem desperate in the right way. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=624.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=626.94s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=627.34s)]
*  That's, that's where you won the game. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=628.18s)]
*  You're going back to Minnesota. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=630.86s)]
*  You win three and you're done and you get to the next round. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=631.82s)]
*  But, um, I think what he'll learn in situations like this, like when you're [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=635.1s)]
*  talking like 27 year old aunt, the thing that he's going to learn that I don't [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=639.34s)]
*  think he really fully realizes yet. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=643.38s)]
*  It's like, this is a, you know, go for the jugular game. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=645.5s)]
*  This is like, we, if we go up, oh, two, they're not going to come back. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=650.5400000000001s)]
*  We're going to have three games in Minnesota. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=653.86s)]
*  Um, and he just didn't have that tonight. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=656.1s)]
*  And again, I don't know how hurt he is, but it was a weird one from him. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=657.94s)]
*  Minnesota also couldn't make a three. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=661.1s)]
*  Part of that had to do with how, how, uh, how the Lakers are scrambled around, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=663.14s)]
*  but Minnesota finished five for 25 after they went like 30 for 40 in game one, I [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=666.6600000000001s)]
*  think, but it was a game that aunt just couldn't match the intensity of the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=671.54s)]
*  other team. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=675.62s)]
*  Randall was ironically really good. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=676.0999999999999s)]
*  He had 27 physically. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  Um, I noticed, especially in person watching the bodies bank, cause you always [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=680.62s)]
*  get a better sense of it in person. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=684.78s)]
*  Um, he, he bangs with LeBron. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=687.02s)]
*  He bangs with Luca. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=689.74s)]
*  Like he's as big and as strong at Rui. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=690.62s)]
*  It's as big, as strong as anyone in the Lakers. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=693.3s)]
*  And it actually seems like a really good matchup. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=695.66s)]
*  The problem for Minnesota is the Conley piece. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=697.38s)]
*  Conley, uh, zero points today, over five had some wide open shots and just looked [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=699.7s)]
*  old and they didn't really know what to do. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=704.5s)]
*  Um, D'Fenchenzo got in foul trouble right away, but, uh, I'm still not positive [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=707.26s)]
*  who the best five guys are as a unit on this Minnesota team. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=712.34s)]
*  And I think not positive they know either. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=715.78s)]
*  So, uh, I don't know what's going to happen in this series. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=718.78s)]
*  It's really independent on two things. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=723.4200000000001s)]
*  Can the Lakers get away with playing those four guys as many minutes as they [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=726.02s)]
*  played them tonight? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=729.9s)]
*  Cause I think they're going to have to win four games. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=730.66s)]
*  That's one. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=732.6199999999999s)]
*  And then the second is does the end have an end to be the best player in the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=733.66s)]
*  series because I don't see another scenario that, that they win three more [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=739.18s)]
*  games unless he can rise up a level. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=744.66s)]
*  He had that incredible dunk in the third quarter. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=746.8599999999999s)]
*  That was breathtaking. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=749.3s)]
*  But, um, this feels like it's an ant first, Luca series. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=750.26s)]
*  That was my takeaway tonight. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=755.26s)]
*  I think LeBron is going to do what he did tonight and he's going to, you [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=756.46s)]
*  know, he, he's a fixed cost in the series. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=761.6600000000001s)]
*  I know what I'm getting from him. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=764.74s)]
*  For the most part, the threes are going to come and go, but for the most part, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=765.94s)]
*  we're going to get the energy and the creativity like we had tonight. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=768.46s)]
*  Luca is the wild card because he might have, you know, he might have 45 [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=772.0600000000001s)]
*  points in game three and then in on the other end, what can he create? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=775.78s)]
*  Um, and how much can they survive this weird go bear thing? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=779.82s)]
*  He was really bad today. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=783.9s)]
*  He was six and six, some butterfinger moments and they just kept attacking [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=785.9s)]
*  them and attacking them, attacking them. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=789.82s)]
*  And ultimately who's their best five. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=791.1s)]

*  Who do you think is going to win this series by the way, now that you've seen two [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=973.22s)]

*  about it, went home court advantage and best player in the world. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=981.58s)]
*  And, uh, I listened to you and Ryan after game one, I felt exactly the same [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=985.26s)]
*  way you guys did that the nuggets kind of stole that game and I would feel really [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=991.0200000000001s)]
*  good about the series if I were a Clippers fan and then they won game two. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=995.86s)]
*  Obviously we're doing this right after that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=998.74s)]
*  Uh, I would feel good if I were a Clippers fan. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1001.26s)]
*  I'm going to stand by my pick, obviously, cause you know, I don't repick [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1003.6600000000001s)]
*  repick series halfway through, but, um, I think Clippers have outplayed [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1006.94s)]
*  them and if they're going to have, we're going to talk about Kawhi and if they're [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1011.38s)]
*  going to have one guy in each game and it was hardened in game one, Kawhi in [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1013.78s)]
*  game two, who's essentially like on par with Yoke Hitch, they're going to win [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1017.5s)]
*  the series, right? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1021.22s)]
*  They just need somebody to cancel him out numbers wise in some way. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1022.54s)]
*  Um, they got out rebounded by 18 last night and one, they got, they survived [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1027.58s)]
*  a really great Michael Porter performance compared to his complete no [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1036.18s)]
*  show in game one and that didn't matter. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1041.38s)]
*  Um, but the Kawhi piece was the piece and it got me thinking like you and I have [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1043.98s)]
*  known each other for basically Kawhi's entire career. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1049.22s)]
*  I think we first met each other at least like on email or wherever in 2011, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1051.9s)]
*  which is here, he was drafted. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1057.5800000000002s)]
*  I thought one of the best pieces you ever wrote for Grantland was the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1059.38s)]
*  Kawhi George Hill trade piece, which was, I think, um, I just remember when you [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1062.26s)]
*  wrote it, I was like, this is, I feel like this is where basketball writing is heading. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1067.06s)]
*  Like it's not just like, who, you know, this is like some sort of, it was [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1072.7s)]
*  sourced, why did they do this? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1077.3799999999999s)]
*  Where's this going? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1079.54s)]
*  It was a sliding doors moment. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1080.34s)]
*  I still can't believe they like multiple front office people talk to me on the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1082.54s)]
*  record for that piece about like what was going on during the draft? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1086.02s)]
*  What were they thinking? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1088.82s)]
*  I'm like, well, maybe that's why. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1089.66s)]
*  Maybe it was like a new ish piece and they were like, oh, this will be fun. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1091.02s)]
*  Let's do this interview and reveal like what was going on for this. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1094.62s)]
*  It happened anymore, right? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1098.22s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1099.3799999999999s)]
*  Anyone's doing that again. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1100.02s)]
*  For some reason in the early 2010s, people were like, here's some information. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1101.34s)]
*  Take it wherever. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1107.82s)]
*  Worked out well for me. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1108.78s)]
*  So then Kawhi, he has a couple of different arts. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1110.1s)]
*  There's never been a career like this. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1114.1399999999999s)]
*  And I said to you, just come on my podcast. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1116.82s)]
*  We're not going to do an hour and a half. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1119.1s)]
*  Let's talk about Kawhi Leonard because I can't remember really anything like this. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1120.34s)]
*  I think it's the second biggest what if career of all time. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1124.9399999999998s)]
*  I'm going to start there. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1128.22s)]
*  I think Bill Walton is still number one. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1129.1399999999999s)]
*  I think Kawhi's second where it's been a great career. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1132.22s)]
*  He's making the hall of fame anyway. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1135.82s)]
*  He was NBA top 75, but there's this extra gear and it came down to bad luck and [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1136.98s)]
*  injuries, which happens so much in the NBA, but you see stuff like last night [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1143.3799999999999s)]
*  and you go back and you look through some of the history and you're like, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1147.74s)]
*  could this guy have been like one of the 15 best players of all time? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1150.62s)]
*  Oh, there's, there's no, did he make top 75? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1154.6599999999999s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1157.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1157.74s)]
*  He did. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1158.1s)]
*  So there's no question. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1158.74s)]
*  He would be one of the top three. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1159.58s)]
*  He might already be one of the top 50 players of all time. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1160.62s)]
*  He's a two time finals MVP. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1162.6999999999998s)]
*  He's kind of like the 15. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1164.4599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I'm talking like, oh, I'm talking high levels. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1167.26s)]
*  So now you're talking like he's in the Durant, Berkeley, Yannis, maybe heading [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1172.34s)]
*  toward where that Shaq Moses, a Keem level, like how high could it have gone? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1177.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1182.02s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1183.46s)]
*  Now health is a huge part of this. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1185.98s)]
*  Durability is a huge part of this. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1187.46s)]
*  And the, and the best guys ever have always managed to stay on the court has [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1188.9s)]
*  been one of the things and he wasn't able to do that, which is why it's a what if. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1192.9s)]
*  But his best was up there with everybody from this century. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1196.8600000000001s)]
*  No question. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1202.66s)]
*  Two time finals, MVP defensive player of the year. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1203.38s)]
*  Um, 50, 40, 85 in the playoffs. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1206.82s)]
*  Uh, and we'll talk, we, I have, I did a little dig. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1210.94s)]

*  four bouncer, um, in, in, in Toronto against the Sixers. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1232.4199999999998s)]
*  Uh, and like, again, you never know, like with these guys, like all the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1237.58s)]
*  time he's missed, if he had played all that time, what, if he, it's, if he had [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1243.74s)]
*  played twice as many minutes or 1.5 times as many minutes, how does he look right [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1248.82s)]
*  now? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1253.78s)]
*  Cause right now he looks incredible and fresh and all that stuff. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1253.8999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, look, he hasn't finished the season healthy since 2020. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1258.02s)]
*  Since the bubble, he has not finished his team season available to play since the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1262.4599999999998s)]
*  Clippers flamed out in the bubble and knock on wood, we're only two games into [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1266.6999999999998s)]
*  this and he's playing a ton of minutes and he played a ton of minutes at the end [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1270.26s)]
*  of the season. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1272.9399999999998s)]
*  If he plays like this, like, I think we just get, did you just give up on this? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1274.26s)]
*  Like, I just kind of get like when they lost Paul George and free agency, I was [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1278.54s)]
*  just kind of like, he's going to mishap the season. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1282.82s)]
*  It's going to be all dependent. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1285.58s)]
*  I just didn't see the Clippers ever reaching this level again in this iteration [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1286.82s)]
*  of them in part because I just kind of gave up on this. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1291.26s)]
*  It just seemed like a pipe dream that we'd ever see this level Kawhi in the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1294.94s)]
*  playoffs every game. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1298.66s)]
*  And I really, you know how much I love Kawhi. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1299.82s)]
*  I voted him MVP in their year. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1302.74s)]
*  Russ won the MVP when it was a super controversial, but I think I was one of [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1305.06s)]
*  eight guys to vote for him. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1307.94s)]
*  I thought he was the best player in the league that year. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1308.9s)]
*  And I just hope we get to see this because what he did, what he's doing and [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1311.3799999999999s)]
*  just eviscerating every defender that they threw at him last night, 15 of 19 [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1316.14s)]
*  for 39 points is ridiculous. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1320.58s)]
*  And the last basket of the game or yeah, it was to put them up by three. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1322.06s)]
*  Hard, hard shots too. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1326.5s)]
*  And a steal right after that. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1328.74s)]
*  Contested shots. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1329.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1330.46s)]
*  He just, what we saw last night in game two, which is why I want to do this [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1331.02s)]
*  segment, cause I don't feel like it's possible to overreact to it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1335.58s)]
*  What he did last night was as good as I think I've ever seen him play. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1339.02s)]
*  And this is a guy who's had some amazing, amazing moments, but yeah, I [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1342.8999999999999s)]
*  mean, if you go through it, there's so many what ifs with him where you start [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1347.5s)]
*  with like, what if, what if the 2017 playoffs when he gets hurt, right? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1353.26s)]
*  I don't think they would have beaten Golden State. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1358.18s)]
*  I think that's one of the three or four best teams of our lifetime, but it [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1359.9s)]
*  would have been a good series. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1365.3400000000001s)]
*  And so we saw enough in the two and a half quarters of that game to be like, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1367.26s)]
*  okay, like he's going to give them a punchless chance in all of these games. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1371.58s)]
*  Like they'll probably lose four, two or four one, but this is going to, this [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1374.9s)]
*  isn't going to be like a walkover, like everything else they had that year. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1377.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1380.5800000000002s)]
*  He's going to be throwing punches. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1380.7800000000002s)]
*  What if he signs off on the 2018 Boston trade is a really good what if Boston [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1383.0600000000002s)]
*  was trying to come after him? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1388.5800000000002s)]
*  Take me, take me. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1390.14s)]
*  That's, that's your, that's your world. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1391.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, that at least would have been Jalen Brown and some other stuff. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1392.74s)]
*  And you know, I think Boston was really hesitant to actually consider talking [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1396.0600000000002s)]
*  about it because he was making it so clear. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1401.5s)]
*  This is a one year thing. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1403.46s)]
*  And I'm going to LA and wink, wink. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1405.38s)]
*  I'm, I'm going to a different city after with Toronto didn't care. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1408.02s)]
*  There's the what if Kauai just re-signs with Toronto in 2019 because they had a [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1412.42s)]
*  pretty good nucleus, you know, and you think like the league was a little bit weird [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1416.42s)]
*  there in 20 and 21, 22, could they have gotten back in games the next year? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1420.5s)]
*  They were one of the best stories. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1424.3000000000002s)]
*  I think did Nick Nurse win coach of the year that year? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1425.38s)]
*  I think after, yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1427.9s)]
*  Um, there's the what if Kauai signs with LeBron and the Lakers in 2019, which [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1429.66s)]
*  is what we thought was going to happen. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1434.78s)]
*  And I don't even know. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1437.02s)]
*  Can they get Anthony Davis at that point? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1437.7s)]
*  Probably. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1439.5s)]
*  I don't know if they could, maybe they could have fit all these. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1439.94s)]
*  I can't remember the details of it, but maybe if you get Kauai, you don't [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1442.02s)]
*  need Anthony Davis and you're using those picks for other things, you're [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1445.78s)]
*  building around those two guys. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1448.82s)]
*  Those two guys make sense together. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1449.98s)]
*  What if, what if he starts getting hurt within a couple of months after that [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1452.1s)]
*  trade and now LeBron has no running mate and that just goes- [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1455.86s)]
*  It's ridiculous to even suggest this, Bill. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1458.98s)]
*  Nothing like that ever falls into the Lakers laps. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1461.02s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1463.54s)]
*  They don't just get stars. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1464.54s)]
*  They go to their team like shockingly. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1465.74s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1467.74s)]
*  What if COVID doesn't happen is a really good what if for really a bunch of [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1469.46s)]
*  different people in 2020, but especially when you think about where the league [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1473.1s)]
*  was at that moment, Milwaukee was kicking everybody's ass, the Lakers and Clippers [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1476.34s)]
*  were the two best teams in the West. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1480.98s)]
*  And it felt like there were three teams and then everyone else. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1482.5s)]
*  And we were headed toward this LA versus LA, then the COVID, the bubble, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1485.3s)]
*  things get weird, whatever. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1489.42s)]
*  And then, you know, the last one is what if he stays healthy in 2021, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1490.6999999999998s)]
*  when he gets hurt and then Paul George elevates, but I forgot this. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1494.6999999999998s)]
*  He played 11 playoff games that year in 2011 and he averaged 30 a game [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1498.9399999999998s)]
*  in the playoff games. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1502.8999999999999s)]
*  Seven against Dallas and four against Utah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1504.02s)]
*  And then kind of left. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1508.62s)]
*  I went to the game where he kind of left near the end of the game. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  It's like, uh-oh, that's not great. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1512.58s)]
*  Well, can we, can we, can we just stop for a second? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1515.3799999999999s)]
*  Like we shouldn't, we shouldn't slow down on it. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1517.6999999999998s)]
*  We should, we should slow down at a couple of things. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1520.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1522.3s)]
*  Um, the first one is the bubble and COVID because I picked the Clippers to win [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1522.58s)]
*  the championship that year and we learned pretty quickly even during the bubble. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1528.06s)]
*  And then after that, no team wanted to be there less than the Clippers. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1532.5s)]
*  And they just completely, I don't know that I've ever seen a team let go of the [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1536.98s)]
*  rope like that, uh, like they did against Denver. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1540.74s)]
*  Like they wanted to leave over trying to try to win the title. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1543.26s)]
*  Seemed to be a feeling that was pretty pervasive. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1546.78s)]
*  And 2021, he gets hurt against Utah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1549.9s)]
*  Um, the series is two, two when he gets hurt and they end up winning the series. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1552.58s)]
*  The end, essentially the end of the jazz of the Mitchell go bear, you know, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1555.82s)]
*  it or if they had one more year after that, but everyone knew it was kind of over. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1559.82s)]
*  Um, we just like, I, I, that 45 point game six to save the Clippers season. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1563.06s)]
*  And remember that series against Dallas, they get rolled the first two games in [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1571.7s)]
*  LA, they're down like a million points in game three in Dallas, and it just feels [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1575.1s)]
*  like it's over, they saved the season. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1578.54s)]
*  They're still down three, two in game six. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1581.1399999999999s)]
*  And he plays one of the best games I've ever seen anyone play 18 of 25, 13 of 16 [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1584.8999999999999s)]
*  at the line, 45 points and the usual defense and single-handedly wins the game [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1590.42s)]
*  and saves their season. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1595.3s)]
*  Then he follows it up with like a whole hum, 28, 10 and nine in game seven. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1596.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1599.3s)]
*  Just that's one of the best games that's up there with any game. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1599.7s)]
*  I've ever seen anybody play. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1603.26s)]
*  I just wanted to say that it's all down and say that game. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1605.22s)]
*  Well, and then you think from a Quipper standpoint, the most tortured NBA [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1607.8999999999999s)]
*  franchise we have in 21 is just wide open. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1611.54s)]
*  You look back at that season, it's like bucks team that I'm not even sure [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1614.42s)]
*  it was the best bucks team. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1618.46s)]
*  Um, the sons make it right. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1620.42s)]
*  And I think there's a bunch of teams that are like, Oh, we could have [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1623.26s)]
*  beaten that if this had happened or this had happened or this had happened. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1625.98s)]
*  And that ends up being our finals and the bucks wins, but bucks win. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1628.6599999999999s)]
*  But I think the 22 bucks team, you could make a case of Middleton's healthy [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1632.3s)]
*  that year that they're probably a better team than the 21 team. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1636.98s)]
*  So anyway, a whole bunch of what ifs from the what if career standpoint, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1640.18s)]
*  Walton's still number one for me because he just wins multiple titles [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1644.3s)]
*  in the late seventies and goes down as one of the best 15 guys ever. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1648.5s)]
*  He, Kawhi is second. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1653.26s)]
*  And then my other two for my lifetime were Andrew Tony, who really only [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1654.8600000000001s)]
*  played five years and then his feet went on him, but I just think would [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1658.5s)]
*  have been a hall of fame to guard and probably the second best to guard [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1661.78s)]
*  in the league behind Jordan. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1665.02s)]
*  And then Bernard King was the other one, the 20, he's 20 years old [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1666.6200000000001s)]
*  when he blew out his knee. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1669.6200000000001s)]
*  He's averaging 33 a game that year, which in 19 mid 80s standards is like 40. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1670.8600000000001s)]
*  Um, and came back, but was never really the same, but was the, you know, he [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1676.42s)]
*  was the forward scoring Michael Jordan of that era. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1681.1s)]
*  And then the only other one I have is Yao. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1683.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up Yao because I was the one where it's like, ah, man, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1686.5s)]
*  we kind of forget that Yao only played like eight years. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1690.06s)]
*  Ralph Sampson. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1694.1s)]
*  Sampson's a good one. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1695.98s)]
*  I don't, I'm not sure he knew where he got hurt, but I'm not, I've always [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1697.18s)]
*  felt like he spent four years in college and then it's like, am I a center? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1701.46s)]
*  Why am I in the perimeter this much? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1705.7s)]
*  I'm never sure he totally figured that out from like a ceiling standpoint. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1707.14s)]
*  Yao could have been 23 and 10 for like 15 years, but I think the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1710.9s)]
*  China national team murdered him. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1715.78s)]
*  And then there's some other ones. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1717.5s)]
*  There's like the TMAC and C web, but those are guys like they had good careers [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1718.34s)]
*  and they got hurt a little bit later. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1722.9s)]
*  Um, but I think those are my five. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1724.9s)]
*  Anybody else you have? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1726.9s)]
*  Well, there are some, it depends how, um, how, what if you want to, I mean, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1728.0200000000002s)]
*  lend bias, never play in the NBA before. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1734.7s)]
*  So I'm glad you brought up Yao because I just did, I just did to point to your [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1738.5400000000002s)]
*  point about how unique Kawhi's career is. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1742.6200000000001s)]
*  I just did a search on Basel reference. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1745.2600000000002s)]
*  People in the hall of fame, um, with player efficiency ratings for their [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1747.7s)]
*  career PR everyone craps on it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1752.7s)]
*  I was thinking useful. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1754.9s)]
*  Like if I just need to catch all like, was this guy good? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1755.7s)]
*  How was he right? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1757.98s)]
*  PR above 22 for their career. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1759.02s)]
*  Kawhi's regular season is 23.2. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1761.02s)]
*  I think, um, and cause I wanted to see how many guys hall of fame that elite [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1764.02s)]
*  level and how many played fewer than Kawhi minutes wise, I think Kawhi's are [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1769.94s)]
*  about 23,000 career regular season minutes. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1774.6200000000001s)]
*  There's only, there's only three guys in the hall of fame that meet that [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1777.46s)]
*  PR standard and played fewer minutes than Kawhi. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1781.38s)]
*  One is George Mike in, okay. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1783.7800000000002s)]
*  Like original NBA, you know, dinosaur, but innovator, ABA commissioner, all that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1785.7s)]
*  One is Neil Johnston fifties Philadelphia, where he probably made your book of [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1791.18s)]
*  basketball, Bill Russell kind of took them out. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1795.42s)]
*  And the third is Yao Ming. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1797.98s)]
*  And so that was a name that I thought of right away when I, and before I did that [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1800.0600000000002s)]
*  search, he only played 15,818 career minutes. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1804.3400000000001s)]
*  But obviously unlike Yao Kawhi is a multi-time champion, multi-time finals MVP. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1807.62s)]
*  There's just, there's, and then you go right. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1812.74s)]
*  And then there's a, a Neil Johnson played 18,300 minutes. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1815.1s)]
*  And then there's a 10,000 minute jump to the next guy on this list. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1818.7s)]
*  And it's Dr. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1822.58s)]
*  J who obviously played in the ABA too. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1823.18s)]
*  So he's got other, like, there's just, there's a 10,000 minute gap between those [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1824.94s)]
*  two guys and Kawhi's right in the middle of it. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1829.58s)]
*  Well, and then you think there's only three guys who ever won finals MVP for two [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1832.42s)]
*  teams in the other tour, LeBron and Kareem. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1836.66s)]
*  I have my 42 club that I still stand by as one of the dumbest, but accurate. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1839.38s)]
*  Is the, wait, is that the one that cuts off Carl Malone or cut? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1843.7s)]
*  Yeah, I got to 42 because it was the best way to cut off as many Carl Malone [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1846.46s)]
*  seasons as possible points, rebounds and assists. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1850.5800000000002s)]
*  Poor guy. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1853.8600000000001s)]
*  Sorry, Carl. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1855.5800000000002s)]
*  No, don't be sorry. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1856.5s)]
*  If you go 42 club who made the finals since Michael Jordan, Shaq has three, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1858.22s)]
*  LeBron has six, Kobe wants to know when Iverson wants no one didn't win the title. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1865.98s)]
*  Duncan and Oh three 45.4. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1872.7800000000002s)]
*  Kauai 19 45.4. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1875.74s)]
*  Yonis and 21 48.1. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1878.46s)]
*  Yokos in 23 53.5 and Luca last year 47.0. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1881.02s)]
*  Gives you a sense of first of all, how great that 19 season was, but then also [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1886.3400000000001s)]
*  like that's where we are. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1891.46s)]
*  And the only outlier in all of that is probably Iverson who just, he took a ton [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1893.62s)]
*  of shots, but wasn't like a points rebounds, assists, like how some of these other ones, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1898.8999999999999s)]
*  even Kobe only made it once. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1904.9799999999998s)]
*  Um, and then the other thing with Kauai, um, well, how many guys have gone from [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1906.6599999999999s)]
*  incredible glue guy to awesome a plus list score? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1915.54s)]
*  I was trying to think like SGA Kauai was a better blue guy than SGA, but where you [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1921.74s)]
*  thought their career was going to be one thing and then it became something [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1927.9s)]
*  completely different. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1931.74s)]
*  How many guys can you think of who were like, wow, I just didn't see this because [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1934.98s)]
*  we, we were working together and we were going to those finals games. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1940.94s)]
*  I never thought Kauai would be a guy who averaged 30 a game in the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1945.54s)]
*  playoffs that was inconceivable. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1948.38s)]
*  Well, I remember after the first Spurs heat final that the Spurs lose the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1950.38s)]
*  Ray Allen game and all that. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1954.5s)]
*  He had moments in that series. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1957.7s)]
*  I don't have his game log up in front of me now, but he had moments in that [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1960.18s)]
*  series where it was like, Ooh, something, something's interesting is happening [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1962.74s)]
*  with this Kauai like he's, he's guarding LeBron like that. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1966.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1969.66s)]
*  Fine. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1969.8600000000001s)]
*  Like he's a great defensive player. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1970.26s)]
*  Actually, let me bring up his game log as I'm talking, but he's guarding LeBron. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1971.8600000000001s)]
*  He's guarding LeBron comfortably by the way. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1975.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1977.9s)]
*  And LeBron respects him already. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1978.3000000000002s)]
*  And now he has games I'm looking at here. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1979.9s)]
*  The here's his last three games of the, of those 2013, 13 or 14, 13, the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1981.38s)]
*  one they lose to Miami 16 points on six of eight shooting 22 points and 11 [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1987.02s)]
*  rebounds on nine to 14 shooting game seven, 19. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1993.78s)]
*  I miss is a big free throw in game six. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1997.06s)]
*  Obviously people remember that 19 and 16 on eight of 17 in game seven, 45 minutes, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=1998.6200000000001s)]
*  46 minutes a game before he has double digit rebounds in five of the seven games. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2004.42s)]
*  I remember before the next season, I wrote a piece about this cause this for [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2009.4199999999998s)]
*  Grantland, this guy is the biggest X factor in the league this year. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2014.4599999999998s)]
*  And I was like the only time I think I ever got a one-on-one interview with [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2018.4599999999998s)]
*  Kauai, I called the Spurs. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2021.58s)]
*  I was like, Hey, I'm writing all about this kid. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2023.1799999999998s)]
*  They keep as a kid back then, whatever. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2025.4199999999998s)]
*  And I remember their PR guy, Tom James was like, this will, this, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2027.2199999999998s)]
*  this will be your one for the year. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2031.34s)]
*  Like don't, don't call it as for pop. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2032.78s)]
*  He was being polite about it, but like, you know, the Spurs are, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2034.62s)]
*  it's like, you're not getting popped. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2036.74s)]
*  Like this will be the one. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2037.58s)]
*  But like, I think it's a good idea. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2038.34s)]
*  You should do it. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2040.1399999999999s)]
*  And then he ends up winning finals, MVP, making me look really, really smart, but [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2041.3s)]
*  you could see enough in that first finals or it was like, okay, something [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2045.34s)]
*  different is going on, something more is here, but again, to be an MVP candidate [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2049.7s)]
*  and a guy who, you know, we'll go through his playoff numbers, but even then, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2055.58s)]
*  you, even in the 2014 finals, I don't think you could see that coming. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2059.42s)]
*  It was, he was kind of like MVP by, you had to pick a spur and he was, you know, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2062.14s)]
*  it was such a team win and he did, you know, LeBron's numbers are actually pretty [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2068.02s)]
*  good when you look back at that series, but he did a good job of at least going [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2072.7400000000002s)]
*  toe to toe with LeBron, which is why I think he won and his stats were good. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2076.1s)]
*  He was in an interesting spot there. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2079.42s)]
*  The first couple of years we were working together where he was the go-to [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2081.14s)]
*  guy, if you were talking about, you know, who I really love. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2084.7400000000002s)]
*  And he was the guy like, who's that now in 2025 or the, you know, I really love. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2088.26s)]
*  It's like, it's like a Jalen Johnson, like those guys. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2095.06s)]
*  But on a better team, but those kind of like Evan Mobley or Cade [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2097.82s)]
*  Cunningham before this year. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2100.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2102.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2102.6600000000003s)]
*  Um, maybe not even quite quite that, but he didn't have the pedigree of those guys. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2103.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2107.5800000000004s)]
*  But it was one of those things coming out of the gate where they were like, yeah, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2107.86s)]
*  there's something here with this guy. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2111.5800000000004s)]
*  But I always thought his, I thought he was going to be Pippen and Pippen was a [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2112.82s)]
*  better, like kind of passer creator than him. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2117.5s)]
*  He had the ball more than who I did. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2120.86s)]
*  But to me, the best still to this day, the best three perimeter players [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2122.26s)]
*  I've ever seen in person. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2126.1800000000003s)]
*  And maybe, maybe a man Thompson can get here, but maybe, I don't know. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2128.1000000000004s)]
*  What is he? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2133.98s)]
*  22, but the best I've ever seen in person, Pippen one, Kawhi and Rodman. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2134.38s)]
*  If I'm just talking about, I need a long athleticism. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2140.5800000000004s)]
*  I need a long athletic perimeter to shut down the score. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2143.26s)]
*  Who am I picking? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2146.5s)]
*  Those are the three guys. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2147.46s)]
*  And then after that we can argue, but those three guys have to be on the list. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2149.06s)]
*  Is there anybody else you would add? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2153.86s)]
*  For defense? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2155.6600000000003s)]
*  I'd have to sit and think about it for a second, but I mean, you know, Gary [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2156.5s)]
*  Peyton wasn't big enough to be in this conversation, right? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2160.74s)]
*  Like, is it, um, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2163.66s)]
*  you're talking about guys who could guard everybody from LeBron James to Tony [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2165.34s)]
*  Parker, like you just, anybody basically from six one to six 10, they could [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2170.02s)]
*  handle and also maybe even like, you could throw Kawhi at Yoke-Age at this [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2174.82s)]
*  point and it's not like crazy. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2178.02s)]
*  I'll give you this one too. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2179.86s)]
*  Um, I'm going to, I sound like an old man. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2181.34s)]
*  It's not that long ago, but like, he's still a very good defender. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2185.26s)]
*  Now, like if he were healthy and played the whole year, he'd be in the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2188.0200000000004s)]
*  all defense conversation. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2190.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2192.0600000000004s)]
*  That's he's still that good. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2192.3s)]
*  Peak Kawhi, like 2016 to 18, 19 defensive player of the year, candidate [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2195.0600000000004s)]
*  Kawhi was legitimately terrifying. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2200.78s)]
*  And to the point that he would turn entire games, entire games by himself, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2204.34s)]
*  like steel, dunk, block, dunk, steel, three pointer and be like, what just [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2210.6200000000003s)]
*  happened that that one guy just going to nine Oh right. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2216.54s)]
*  And I remember the most underrated playoff series. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2219.34s)]
*  I think maybe anyone has ever played is that year. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2221.6600000000003s)]
*  Um, Kawhi against Memphis in 2017 in the first round, like a, like a whole [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2225.6600000000003s)]
*  home Memphis team dispersion to one that series was like incredible in that [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2231.9s)]
*  series and did everything for that team. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2236.3s)]
*  And, and just like people can go back and look it up. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2238.9s)]
*  But I like, remember the Ben McLemore thing? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2241.6200000000003s)]
*  I think he ruined Ben McLemore's career because Ben McLemore tried to dribble [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2244.6600000000003s)]
*  within like a 10 foot radius of Kawhi and Kawhi just took the ball out of his [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2248.9s)]
*  hands, two possessions in a row and went and dunked on the other. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2253.02s)]
*  And I wanted to write a story about that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2256.54s)]
*  I approached Ben McLemore's people once and I was like, can I write this story? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2258.1800000000003s)]
*  And then again, I don't think he wants to talk about that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2262.5s)]
*  It's still not ready. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2264.38s)]
*  But he ended up writing something different about him. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2266.34s)]
*  He is quite an, he was very sweet guy and had an interesting arc to his career. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2268.5s)]
*  But like peak Kawhi, if you were not like an A level dribbler, you could not [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2272.34s)]
*  dribble anywhere near him, you would just take the ball from him. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2278.34s)]
*  Well, I remember one of my last pieces I wrote for Grantland. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2280.7000000000003s)]
*  We did this art drawing. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2284.7400000000002s)]
*  Cause I was talking, we were talking about how Kawhi was like an octopus. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2286.6600000000003s)]
*  He, he hit this level the second half of that 2015 season coming off the finals. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2291.5800000000004s)]
*  MVP. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2296.18s)]
*  And that second half of the season where there was a lot of storylines [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2297.74s)]
*  going right, like Curry, the Warriors are winning 67 games. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2302.54s)]
*  Curry's about to win an MVP. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2305.3799999999997s)]
*  Blake has become one of the best five guys in the league. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2307.1s)]
*  LeBron's in his first Cleveland season. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2309.7799999999997s)]
*  Harden has started to really kick ass on Houston. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2311.62s)]
*  And it felt like this sea change of like this new generation of guys taking over [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2314.3799999999997s)]
*  kind of taking the steering wheel of the league and then Kawhi was in there [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2319.74s)]
*  just wrecking everybody. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2323.4199999999996s)]
*  And I remember we did this octopus drawing of him and it's, you can find it [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2324.54s)]
*  probably in the one of the last grand, Kawhi's face on this octopus. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2328.06s)]
*  Cause he would just kind of be on the court, he'd be like, I'm just going to [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2331.82s)]
*  take the ball and he would just go over and like grab the ball. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2334.62s)]
*  But you can see the moment when he would decide, actually, I think I can just get [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2337.7s)]
*  the ball. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2342.22s)]
*  Like you're going to make it like everything's normal. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2342.66s)]
*  I'm just, how about I just take it? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2344.74s)]
*  I'm just going to grab it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2346.62s)]
*  So that stretch he had on the Spurs basically from the second half of 15, 16, 17 [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2347.66s)]
*  leading to him stepping on Zaza's foot. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2353.98s)]
*  Um, he was as good as any, and we have Durant, Hummin on OKC at that point. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2357.18s)]
*  We have kind of the last stages of Carmelo. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2364.62s)]
*  We have LeBron on Cleveland. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2366.86s)]
*  Um, we have a lot of good forwards and it's just this amazing forward stretch. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2368.78s)]
*  I have him, I was thinking most talented, small forwards of my lifetime. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2372.82s)]
*  Just talented. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2376.86s)]
*  I'm not going best career in that stuff. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2378.06s)]
*  And LeBron's one and Bird's two. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2379.86s)]
*  And then Kawhi versus Durant, if you're just talking Apex, it's pretty good. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2381.62s)]
*  It's a pretty good argument. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2387.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2388.38s)]
*  That's almost a three A three B thing. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2388.7000000000003s)]
*  And I don't, Durant's had a better career because he was more durable. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2390.7000000000003s)]
*  Um, I don't know the answer. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2394.3s)]
*  It's, it's actually kind of amazing and speaks to how great he was during, you [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2396.62s)]
*  know, that five or six year stretch, um, that he's a six time all star because it [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2401.26s)]
*  doesn't feel like he's been healthy enough to be in his prime to be a six time all star. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2406.7000000000003s)]
*  It's just when he's minimally healthy, it's so obvious that he's one of the five to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2410.38s)]
*  eight best players in the league that he just makes the all star team every year. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2414.58s)]
*  The Durant one is interesting. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2418.02s)]
*  Durant's got the height and the quick twitch shooting from any, any range ability. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2419.62s)]
*  This, the bulk and defense, uh, and just, you can't move him at all. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2425.9s)]
*  That Kawhi brings both of them are their assist numbers. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2430.9s)]
*  Durant's probably a little higher, but broadly similar in that they're not a [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2434.3s)]
*  primary creator, they're more of a, they're more of a, they're more of a, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2437.46s)]
*  more secondary creator. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2440.38s)]
*  It's, it's, I mean, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2441.6600000000003s)]
*  it's an interesting, it's an interesting one. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2445.46s)]
*  Well, one other thing with both of them, there was a little bit of a Swiss [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2447.78s)]
*  army knife with each where I felt like you could play Kawhi at either forward [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2451.06s)]
*  spot and get away with it, right? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2454.26s)]
*  You could play Durant. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2455.82s)]
*  I mean, you weren't, it's not awesome to play him at small forward, but you [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2458.58s)]
*  could do it, but really you could, he has the ability to go, you go stretch [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2461.58s)]
*  five with him and just go smaller or you can play him with a center. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2465.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, it was just a more flexibility in a lineup that maybe LeBron had up [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2468.98s)]
*  until later in his career where LeBron was like, he needed certain things around him. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2474.2200000000003s)]
*  Those guys, you could kind of mold if you, whatever your roster is, you [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2479.02s)]
*  could kind of mold them a little bit. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2482.3s)]
*  But I really think those are the four best quote unquote small forwards [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2484.34s)]
*  I've seen in my lifetime. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2489.42s)]
*  Can I, these are, these are great names. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2490.98s)]
*  Can I just do it, read you another list of things I got from best [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2493.14s)]
*  wall reference, searching around. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2495.98s)]
*  Uh, I just did, um, Playoffs. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2498.38s)]
*  These are playoff numbers. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2502.1800000000003s)]
*  Again, PR is not a perfect stat. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2503.78s)]
*  Good catch. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2505.58s)]
*  Oh, Kawhi's career playoff PR is 24.3. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2506.02s)]
*  It's higher than his regular season. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2509.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2510.58s)]
*  Or that, that alone is an accomplishment, by the way, the perimeter guy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2510.86s)]
*  That's really high. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2514.1s)]
*  If you can maintain your efficiency stat, if you're an elite player and you can [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2514.86s)]
*  just maintain your regular season efficiency into the better competition [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2518.42s)]
*  of the playoffs, that alone is an accomplishment to go up a mini level [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2522.34s)]
*  is a big, big deal. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2526.58s)]
*  So I did above a 24 PR at least 4,000 minutes in the playoffs. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2527.7s)]
*  Kawhi's at 5009, I think. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2533.58s)]
*  So you got to have been there a decent amount of time and you [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2535.7s)]
*  maintain a 24 efficiency, 24 PR. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2538.62s)]
*  Eight guys total have ever done it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2542.54s)]
*  And I'll go in order of their player efficiency ratings. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2545.06s)]
*  Number one, Michael Jordan, 28.6. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2547.98s)]
*  Number two, LeBron James, 27.9. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2550.9s)]
*  Number three, Shaq, 26.1. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2554.54s)]
*  Number four, I still think for my money, maybe the most criminally underrated [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2557.58s)]
*  player in the history of the NBA, Akima Olajuwon, 25.7. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2561.42s)]
*  Not by me, not in this house. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2564.7799999999997s)]
*  Number five is a tie at 24.3. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2566.7799999999997s)]
*  And it's just too good that it's a tie. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2570.7s)]
*  Tim Duncan and Kawhi. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2573.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2575.02s)]
*  And then right below them at 24.2 is Barkley, who has the fewest [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2576.54s)]
*  playoff minutes of this group. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2580.94s)]
*  And right below Barkley is Durant at 24 flat. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2582.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2585.26s)]
*  That's the whole list. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2586.1s)]
*  The legend's not in there? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2587.42s)]
*  I'll look up his playoff PR. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2589.78s)]
*  I mean, I know I should have anticipated. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2592.2200000000003s)]
*  No, it's fine. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2595.14s)]
*  He's the last couple of years, a little rocky wearing the back brace. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2596.5s)]
*  Career PR. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2600.98s)]
*  Probably like 23. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2602.46s)]
*  21.4. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2604.66s)]
*  Ah, the legend. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2605.98s)]
*  But he's got, he's got a 26 to 24. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2607.06s)]
*  I mean, it's different. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2609.5s)]
*  It's PR. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2610.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2611.14s)]
*  It's, it's, it's a. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2611.62s)]
*  Well, I have my own basketball reference list. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2613.02s)]
*  You had to play at least 20 games in a playoff season. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2617.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2619.82s)]
*  You'd score at least 30 points. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2621.3s)]
*  Per game. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2623.86s)]
*  Per game. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2625.1s)]
*  And you had to get at least six rebounds. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2625.9s)]
*  Here's that list. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2628.02s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2628.9s)]
*  So 30, hold on, let me 30 and six in at least 20. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2629.18s)]
*  Playoff games. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2632.9s)]
*  So it's 20 plus games. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2633.46s)]
*  You're making the finals. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2634.82s)]
*  You're making the funds. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2635.9s)]
*  Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaq, Kawhi, LeBron again, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2636.94s)]
*  Yannis, LeBron a third time, Jokic. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2644.34s)]
*  That's our list. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2649.26s)]
*  I mean, it lends creed. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2651.98s)]
*  I mean, when you said top 15 earlier in the podcast, I, I mean, again, you're [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2653.34s)]
*  getting into sacred territory there in my initial. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2658.9s)]
*  You're at least near Durant. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2661.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2662.7400000000002s)]
*  You're, you're, you're in that, you're in that, you're in that, you're in that [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2663.26s)]
*  dirt, you're above, you're right around Dirk, you know, like you're in the [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2666.94s)]
*  Dirk, maybe a little edge above Dirk and you're in the Duran area. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2670.78s)]
*  It's, it's pretty sacred territory. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2676.06s)]
*  And now that we're going through these lists, I, I, I can't argue against it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2677.86s)]
*  That the what if is that, is that severe and the what if ceiling is, is that high? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2684.1800000000003s)]
*  Your guy Hakeem 95, 22 playoff games, 33 points a game, 10.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2690.42s)]
*  So if you're criminally underrating Hakeem, you can go to hell. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2700.34s)]
*  Where you know, who's not criminally underrating Hakeem from 1995, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2704.02s)]
*  Dave, David Robinson, or Shaquille O'Deal or Shaq. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2707.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2711.06s)]
*  Or either of those guys. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2711.5s)]
*  Um, yeah, two, couple other quick things with him. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2713.06s)]
*  Three first team OMBs, three second team OMBs. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2717.66s)]
*  That's it for Kawhi. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2720.34s)]
*  Cause he kept getting hurt. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2721.5s)]
*  You could say he's [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2723.14s)]
*  still like a lot. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2723.9s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2724.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2725.2200000000003s)]
*  It's a nice one. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2726.38s)]
*  You could say he's responsible for title teams in San Antonio, Toronto, and maybe [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2728.02s)]
*  Oklahoma city this year because he wants the quipper. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2734.5s)]
*  I'm only coming to the Quippers if you give me Paul George and that leads to, you [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2739.78s)]
*  know, lots of stuff that's still still going on the last 10 years of the [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2745.06s)]
*  playoff games, including the two this that we've just had 2016 through the 25 [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2749.94s)]
*  playoffs, he's 28 and eight 51% shooting 39% from three 88% 66 games. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2755.02s)]
*  It's a 10 year stretch kept getting hurt. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2764.38s)]
*  And then, Oh, and the 2019 Raptors 30 and nine four assists, 49% field [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2767.22s)]
*  goal for the whole playoffs. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2773.38s)]
*  But here's the other thing with him. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2774.82s)]
*  And this is crazy. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2777.2200000000003s)]
*  733 regular season games total. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2777.98s)]
*  That's his career, which seems low considering he was in the 2011 draft. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2780.54s)]
*  Seven 26 winning percentage all time six. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2784.78s)]
*  It's Tim Duncan 2.0. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2788.34s)]
*  It's this it's incredible. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2789.6600000000003s)]
*  The symmetry of those. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2790.9s)]
*  So here's the list magic bird, Casey Jones, Cooper, Tommy [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2791.7000000000003s)]
*  Heinzen, Kawhi Duncan, Sam Jones, Sam Jones. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2795.82s)]
*  Russell is our top nine. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2799.3s)]
*  So a bunch of, a bunch of [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2802.02s)]
*  just for when I play, my team wins almost 73% of the time. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2803.1s)]
*  And yet I can't stay on the court. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2808.3399999999997s)]
*  And by the way, there are Cooper fans probably listening to this going, you [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2809.8199999999997s)]
*  motherfuckers, he's going to get hurt in game three because you guys did this [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2812.7799999999997s)]
*  segment, but there's never been a career like this where he might be. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2815.8199999999997s)]
*  He might end up being like the best guy in the West for the next, you know, this [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2823.54s)]
*  round and the next two, which, you know, I didn't see you talked about giving up on [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2827.66s)]
*  this. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2831.9s)]
*  I gave up on giving up on this. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2832.62s)]
*  I was like three levels beyond giving up on this. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2834.3s)]
*  Even when he came back during the season, I was like, all right, this is stupid. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2837.02s)]
*  He's just going to get hurt. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2840.54s)]
*  Even, even as you're watching the Clippers finish at whatever 16 and whatever, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2841.38s)]
*  they've had an incredible last 35 games. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2846.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2849.2200000000003s)]
*  And he looks incredible. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2850.38s)]
*  And you are saying out loud what, what is completely reasonable, which is that. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2852.62s)]
*  In your opinion, this is the second best team in the Western conference. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2859.0200000000004s)]
*  And I'm watching it and I'm like, yeah, that makes total sense. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2862.5400000000004s)]
*  And my brain just can't even, it still puts them over here in like a separate [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2866.6200000000003s)]
*  category of the standings just because I just never believed we would see it [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2872.1400000000003s)]
*  again. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2877.1400000000003s)]
*  I just, I wouldn't allow myself to, and again, he hasn't finished a season since [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2877.38s)]
*  2020, but I'm glad he brought it back to this year because I think this is the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2881.9s)]
*  coolest thing happening in basketball right now. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2886.26s)]
*  And I, I don't know how far this team can get if he stays healthy and plays like [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2889.0600000000004s)]
*  this, but it's minimal conference finals. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2894.38s)]
*  I think they could be, I don't know. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2896.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't want to put a ceiling on it. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2897.94s)]
*  Thunder are going to be favored against anybody. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2899.5800000000004s)]
*  Um, well, I guess not minimal conference finals cause they're in the Thunder's [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2902.0200000000004s)]
*  bracket, so we'll see like where they can go. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2905.2200000000003s)]
*  But would you rather catch the Thunder sooner or later? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2907.94s)]
*  Would you rather catch the Thunder after they've just completely demolished this [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2910.6200000000003s)]
*  crappy Memphis team and now all of a sudden they're moving up in weight class? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2913.7799999999997s)]
*  I liked, by the way, I liked that one game to adjust almost. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2918.14s)]
*  I liked Rosillo's idea that if you lose by 50 or more in game one, it counts as [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2921.2999999999997s)]
*  two, a two wins for the team. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2925.1s)]
*  Try to push that through. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2928.22s)]
*  But I will say like, not only is this about Kawhi, I think, I think the Clippers [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2929.4199999999996s)]
*  are the team of the year, the franchise of the year, almost in the NBA. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2935.66s)]
*  I mean, the Thunder are the obvious choice because they won 68 games and they're [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2939.2999999999997s)]
*  just incredibly well set up for now and tomorrow to, to a level that no team has [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2942.54s)]
*  ever been, but for the Clippers to win 50 games and be looking like this in the [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2946.22s)]
*  postseason after they lost Paul George and everyone, including me, just wrote [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2951.62s)]
*  this entire era off is now we're just killing time until we pivot into a rebuild [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2956.14s)]
*  and we get our picks back. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2960.58s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be cool. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2961.42s)]
*  That's what we're saying. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2961.9s)]
*  Like this, you're only doing this because you have a new arena. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2962.5s)]
*  Yeah, this is fool's gold. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2965.9s)]
*  You just want to bring people in and make them feel okay that they can recognize [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2967.5s)]
*  a couple of players. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2971.38s)]
*  And the front office was like, actually, I think we signed some pretty good role [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2972.2599999999998s)]
*  players in free agency and we have a lot of faith in Zubots to make another level. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2975.7799999999997s)]
*  And if Kawhi ever can play and we're doing our best, we feel like we're still [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2979.66s)]
*  like a pretty, and they didn't, I don't even think they expected, I think they [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2983.62s)]
*  thought we could be like a cool 46 win, tough as nails defensive oriented team. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2987.4199999999996s)]
*  And for them to be this is incredible. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2993.7s)]
*  It's an incredible job by the coaching staff, Ty Loo, Jeff Van Gundy, the whole [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=2996.7799999999997s)]
*  staff, it's, I think they're like the franchise of the year in the NBA, maybe [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3000.22s)]
*  second to the thunder, I guess you can't undersell what an incredible [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3004.1s)]
*  accomplishment it is for them to be a 50 win team and going toe to toe with the [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3009.02s)]
*  best player in the world in a playoff series in the, you know, middle to upper [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3013.3399999999997s)]
*  half of the Western conference bracket. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3019.06s)]
*  It's, it's ridiculous. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3020.4599999999996s)]
*  Well, and they know they could play with OKC. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3021.98s)]
*  They have a real identity, which I think is so hard to find. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3024.54s)]
*  And there's two teams in the East that have an identity. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3027.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3032.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3033.9s)]
*  The Knicks do not have an identity. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3034.46s)]
*  They just do not concerning first couple of games for it. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3036.1s)]
*  Do not have an identity. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3038.34s)]
*  Remember when I, when we did that pod and I said Tibbs was my wild card. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3039.7s)]
*  Don't be surprised. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3043.82s)]
*  I'm feeling better about that. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3044.9s)]
*  Can I give you a third? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3046.42s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3048.46s)]
*  I'm just supposed to be identity teams. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3048.78s)]
*  Pacers Pacers have an identity. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3050.78s)]
*  No good call. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3052.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3053.46s)]
*  I'll accept it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3053.98s)]
*  Um, Clippers have an identity and unfortunately it's built around this [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3055.14s)]
*  awesome player and they just kind of never know with him, you know, and they view, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3059.74s)]
*  like I heard Marcus Morris today, I saw him on ESPN talking as he played with [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3064.46s)]
*  Kawhi and he loves them and he was like, Kaua is the first guy there. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3067.9s)]
*  Like the guy works his ass off. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3070.9s)]
*  He gets this reputation that he doesn't, but the guy worked as [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3072.42s)]
*  hard as any team that I had. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3075.8599999999997s)]
*  But if you talk to people around the Clippers and Kawhi is always this thing, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3077.5s)]
*  like, yeah, we don't know. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3081.98s)]
*  He does his own thing. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3083.22s)]
*  We he's kind of over here and we just kind of keep our fingers [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3084.18s)]
*  crossed that he's going to be awesome. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3087.8199999999997s)]
*  The difference this time versus some of the other times, he just looks good. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3089.02s)]
*  Like when you watch him, like his side to side stuff and the athleticism, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3094.7s)]
*  it feels like it's back. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3099.02s)]
*  He's got lift on his jumper. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3100.1s)]
*  Like he made a couple of jumpers last night in traffic with a hand in his [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3101.58s)]
*  face and he's able to elevate now like he used to, and he just has that [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3105.8999999999996s)]
*  mind drive shot he can get over anybody. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3109.46s)]
*  And he's such a weird player. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3112.14s)]
*  There's no player like him now. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3113.38s)]
*  Who's like, I just want to get this 14 footer. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3115.2200000000003s)]
*  I just want to get to my spot and get it and I'm going to get it. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3118.58s)]
*  And, you know, so that's why he's always been an elite postseason player. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3121.1400000000003s)]
*  Among many other things is that there is some truth to the idea that in the [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3125.06s)]
*  playoffs, you need a little bit more than in the regular season, at least [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3128.9s)]
*  you need some guys who can get those shots and he can get like the last shot [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3133.1800000000003s)]
*  he made last night to put the Clippers up at one Oh five one Oh two. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3137.46s)]
*  Uh, I think it was, yeah, this is the last shot of the game. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3141.58s)]
*  Um, the last basket of the game. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3144.94s)]
*  They ran a pick and roll to try and get Jamal Murray switched onto him. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3146.78s)]
*  And for maybe the first time in the entire game, the nuggets decided, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3149.58s)]
*  we're not giving you this switch. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3152.98s)]
*  We're going to hedge with Jamal Murray. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3154.3s)]
*  Risk leaving the screener who I think was Norm Powell open and figure that [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3156.78s)]
*  part out, we're just not taking Aaron Gordon off you. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3160.38s)]
*  And he was like, cool. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3163.3s)]
*  Like Aaron Gordon is a tank. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3164.46s)]
*  I'm, I'm totally cool with this. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3165.78s)]
*  I'm still going to get to my spot. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3167.2200000000003s)]
*  And he looked, he made that jumper from the right wing over Aaron Gordon. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3168.7s)]
*  And it was vintage Kawhi, the height, the trajectory, the easels, which he got [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3173.38s)]
*  there against a defender who's one of the only guys in the league who can match [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3177.9s)]
*  his size, strength and athleticism. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3181.22s)]
*  And it was just like walk in the freaking park. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3183.38s)]
*  Denver was basically an underdog heading into the series. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3187.62s)]
*  Clippers were minus one 18 favorites. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3192.46s)]
*  Denver wins game one. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3194.2999999999997s)]
*  I talked about this Sunday night. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3196.06s)]
*  It flips just a little. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3198.7s)]
*  So Denver became a minus one 18 favorite. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3201.42s)]
*  Whereas the Minnesota things flipped wildly now on Fandel, the [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3203.94s)]
*  Clippers are minus one 80 to win the series. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3207.7799999999997s)]
*  And honestly, if, if you, if you tell me you know, way to know this, but if you're [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3212.18s)]
*  like, why is playing the rest of the series and it'll be at the level you're [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3217.38s)]
*  saying, I don't see how Denver wins. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3219.94s)]
*  I asked something Denver has some real issues. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3221.74s)]
*  It goes beyond the Westbrook stuff. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3223.94s)]
*  It's, it's just Rocky. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3225.7s)]
*  Like you gotta be for what this Clippers team is with Kawhi. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3226.86s)]
*  You have to be pretty sure of who you are and what you are. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3229.9s)]
*  And the nuggets, all they know is that Yoko is just fucking awesome. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3232.7400000000002s)]
*  And I don't think they know anything else about their team. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3236.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3238.6200000000003s)]
*  And they beyond six guys, they don't even know who the seventh guy is. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3239.5s)]
*  And he's getting frustrated too. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3242.98s)]
*  Um, he's getting frustrated with the officials. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3245.1800000000003s)]
*  He's been pretty demonstrative, but not, not in a bad way, but with teammates [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3247.58s)]
*  trying to point them in the right direction, seven turnovers, missed some [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3252.2200000000003s)]
*  big free throws in both games, including two late in game one, only six of 10 [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3255.86s)]
*  from the line yesterday. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3260.46s)]
*  I mean, doesn't he look a little worn down to you too? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3261.7400000000002s)]
*  I'd be worn down carrying it. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3264.94s)]
*  Last night as a, as a giant Yoko watcher, as I know you are too, but last night, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3267.2200000000003s)]
*  the guy seemed like he was physically beaten up last night. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3272.34s)]
*  You know, he's had 20 minor injuries, nothing major, but, um, I sound like [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3275.54s)]
*  I'm making excuses for him. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3280.02s)]
*  He sucked last night down the stretch. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3281.06s)]
*  He's bad. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3282.58s)]
*  It's funny you say that because I was, I was in my notes. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3283.38s)]
*  I was taking on the game. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3286.2599999999998s)]
*  I can't remember when it was in the game, but I'm paying very close attention to [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3287.74s)]
*  every Murray, Yoko pitch, pick and roll, how the nuggets decide to guard it. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3291.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3296.98s)]
*  Different ways, different, their default strategy has been X, Y, and Z. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3297.5s)]
*  And there were two in a row, I think in the third quarter, maybe where they [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3301.58s)]
*  didn't, they didn't need to do anything dramatic. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3308.34s)]
*  They didn't even need to do the, their sort of usual response to it so far in [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3311.38s)]
*  this series because Yoko didn't pop to three, which is dangerous for them. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3315.5s)]
*  And he didn't roll into floater area for like a pocket pass from Murray, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3320.46s)]
*  which is a danger area for them. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3324.94s)]
*  So Zubot just kind of saw he just sort of stood at the point of the screen, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3326.78s)]
*  like 19 feet from the basket. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3331.1400000000003s)]
*  And Zubot was like, Oh, cool. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3332.9s)]
*  I can just sort of drop back and play this like a normal pick and roll. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3334.1800000000003s)]
*  And the worst case scenario is he gets a 20 foot jump shot. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3336.78s)]
*  This is, this is a nice reprieve. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3340.34s)]
*  And I just took note of those. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3341.82s)]
*  Cause I was like, I, you don't see him do that very, very often. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3343.1s)]
*  And I said in my notes, like maybe he's tired of it. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3347.82s)]
*  He shouldn't be, he's playing 40 gazillion minutes every night on a team that needs [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3350.9s)]
*  him to do literally everything on offense for them to survive. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3354.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3358.1s)]
*  It was four for eight from three last night. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3358.22s)]
*  I just remember it triggered me in the memories of the Minnesota series last [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3360.14s)]
*  year, when I just thought he lost his legs as that series went on because they, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3365.26s)]
*  they were just absolutely murdering him game after game. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3369.1s)]
*  And they had so many big bodies that throw them. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3371.74s)]
*  Then by the end of it, the three, the three pointer started to go. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3373.94s)]
*  When he starts missing free throws, I always feel like that's a bad sign, but I [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3377.66s)]
*  just think the burden he's carrying on this team, especially not knowing if [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3381.22s)]
*  Porter's going to show up or not. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3384.7799999999997s)]
*  Porter showed up last night and rebounded. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3386.02s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to show up for game three. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3388.38s)]
*  This seems like a team that we've watched a lot of playoffs and I'm even older [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3390.34s)]
*  than you. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3394.38s)]
*  This seems like a team teetering on this could really go badly in these next two [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3395.5s)]
*  Cooper games, or they'll just look, Yokocho will be great in game three and be like, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3400.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, what are we worried about? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3404.82s)]
*  But I just feel like they're like, if I go through every other team, like the [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3405.86s)]
*  Knicks have real problems. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3409.38s)]
*  We knew this. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3410.54s)]
*  I don't, I didn't really change anything. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3411.1400000000003s)]
*  I thought of the Knicks other than I was surprised how well the Pistons have played. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3413.38s)]
*  Uh, the seven of the eight quarters, they look good, right? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3417.58s)]
*  They had one horrible quarter and it's a one-one series. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3420.34s)]
*  The Knicks, we knew they didn't have a bench. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3423.7s)]
*  We knew they were going to have to play too many minutes with those guys. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3425.14s)]
*  Um, Denver, I could just see this going any direction now. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3428.5s)]
*  And I think the Clippers are better than them. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3432.98s)]
*  So we'll see with Kawhi, but I'm glad we captured this moment because [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3434.54s)]
*  Can I just add one more thing that is too irresistible given that this is a podcast [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3438.54s)]
*  with you, I think about Kawhi a hundred nights a year, 50 nights a year for this [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3442.74s)]
*  reason and this reason only. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3451.42s)]
*  I don't even know if you remember this after the 2017 season when Russ wins [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3452.58s)]
*  the MVP and averages a triple double, you voted for Harden, I believe. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3458.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3462.58s)]
*  Um, it was the most we've ever texted about an MVP and you did a classic Zach [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3463.2599999999998s)]
*  rope dope and you went, how though I could feel you going toward Kawhi. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3467.66s)]
*  That was one where I just felt it in my gut. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3472.74s)]
*  But anyway, so you voted for Harden and you're so proud of the vote that [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3474.98s)]
*  I believe you had the maid. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3479.06s)]
*  You were someone at Grantland had them, had these shirts made. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3480.66s)]
*  I should have brought it, but it looks disgusting. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3483.66s)]
*  Right side of history. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3485.74s)]
*  A white t-shirt and it says 2017 MVP, right side of history. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3486.54s)]
*  And it has a photo of Russ and a photo of Harden and a check mark in a [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3492.46s)]
*  box next to Harden and now that's been, that's in my pajama rotations. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3497.66s)]
*  It's one of my pajama shirts. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3502.38s)]
*  So I look at it and it makes me smile, but it also pisses me off because I have [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3503.54s)]
*  the wrong vote for me on the shirt. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3508.22s)]
*  I need a Kawhi version of, I look at the shirt Kawhi's not on it. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3510.5s)]
*  It's the right side of history is James Harden. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3514.42s)]
*  And they're like, well, that's not my side of history, but I [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3516.54s)]
*  wear it anyways, pajamas. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3518.2200000000003s)]
*  So I think about the 2017 MVP, like a third of the year, cause it's pajamas. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3519.38s)]
*  Did you vote for Harden second? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3524.62s)]
*  Probably. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3527.42s)]
*  I think so. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3528.1s)]
*  I I'd have to go look it up. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3528.7s)]
*  I probably did. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3530.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3530.78s)]
*  That was the year, like LeBron was fourth and you just felt like this is insane [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3531.46s)]
*  or that, you know, this is the way this is breaking. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3535.66s)]
*  How, why? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3537.86s)]
*  But there's a. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3539.34s)]
*  There, the LeBron MVP conversation goes every once in a while. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3540.5s)]
*  The only one he has a case for after 2013 is the 18 one when Harden beat him. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3543.54s)]
*  I voted for Harden. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3551.7400000000002s)]
*  The numbers were around the same. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3552.54s)]
*  I voted for Harden too, but Houston won 65 games and you know, Cleveland. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3553.58s)]
*  LeBron spent six straight weeks pouting and giving everyone side eyes, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3558.9s)]
*  which nobody remembers from basketball reference. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3563.98s)]
*  He did his whole team. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3566.14s)]
*  It was like, I need you to trade all these, all these people. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3567.62s)]
*  Basketball reference doesn't capture that unfortunately, but that's, that's [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3570.14s)]
*  the one that I think people mentioned, but Harden clearly should have won that year. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3573.3399999999997s)]
*  All right, Zach, you have a podcast coming Thursday. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3576.46s)]
*  Thursday. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3579.14s)]
*  We're going to recap everything that happens Wednesday and Tuesday, depending [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3579.66s)]
*  on which series we have time to talk about, uh, and look ahead to games, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3583.2599999999998s)]
*  threes and games for that. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3587.66s)]
*  I think that's coming right off a, uh, Warriors rockets game two and it's [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3588.7799999999997s)]
*  coming right off Lakers wolves. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3593.62s)]
*  We'll have a couple of extra days of rest. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3596.14s)]
*  So we'll see if the Lakers are down to O2. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3597.8199999999997s)]
*  It's going to be DEFCON DEFCON one across the airwaves, baby. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3599.54s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3603.42s)]
*  Are you on Kaminga watch or have you just sold out your stock and given up? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3604.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to keep the stock because I'm going down with the ship. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3608.86s)]
*  I still, Tim Legler and I used to joke that we needed t-shirts made on that [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3612.14s)]
*  we could wear on television and the t-shirts would have just said, John, I [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3616.34s)]
*  think Kaminga is good because we were both that, that like, we both would just [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3619.2599999999998s)]
*  be like, I don't understand. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3622.58s)]
*  Like we think this guy's good. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3623.7s)]
*  Warriors fans. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3625.54s)]
*  It's incredibly polarizing. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3626.38s)]
*  Some of them just think he stinks. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3627.58s)]
*  I still think he's interesting and good, but I, you know, if they're not [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3629.58s)]
*  dusting them off now and they're winning games, I, I kind of think the ship has [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3635.06s)]
*  sailed, but you never know in the playoff, the longer you would stay in the playoffs. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3638.94s)]
*  If they get through this series, you know, the matchups change, someone gets hurt. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3642.02s)]
*  You never know. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3644.94s)]
*  But I, I don't even think about him anymore. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3645.38s)]
*  Sadly. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3648.3s)]
*  I don't think Steve Kurt does either. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3649.58s)]
*  Zach, fantastic to see him. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3651.34s)]
*  So glad you're with us. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3653.2599999999998s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3654.2599999999998s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3655.18s)]
*  All right. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3656.9s)]
*  We're taping this part of the podcast early my time on Tuesday morning, because [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3657.1s)]
*  Peter Schrager is about to fly to Green Bay for the NFL draft. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3661.7799999999997s)]
*  Why are we having the NFL draft in Green Bay, the single hardest city to get to [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3667.8199999999997s)]
*  out of all the NFL cities? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3671.42s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3672.62s)]
*  So hard planes, trains and automobiles. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3673.38s)]
*  Uh, I think the NFL has decided that sunny weather and new stadiums get the [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3675.54s)]
*  super bowl and then cold weather Cleveland, Philly, Detroit, Green Bay. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3680.22s)]
*  You get the draft. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3685.2599999999998s)]
*  But, uh, yes, this will, this will be a different destination than just a [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3686.26s)]
*  direct flight on a Delta to Detroit. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3690.34s)]
*  Like last year, I forgot to introduce you as ESPN's Peter Schrager. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3693.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3697.5s)]
*  The worldwide leader. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3698.26s)]
*  Um, you paved the way for me and now I'm here. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3699.42s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3702.0600000000004s)]
*  But what way, what way did I pave? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3702.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, you, I started reading you back in 2002 at my college dorm on ESPN page two. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3706.42s)]
*  And I said, someday I want to write for that website. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3713.1400000000003s)]
*  I didn't realize that, uh, 23 years later, I'd be on, on air doing it on ESPN, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3715.3s)]
*  but I'm here, Bill, let's go. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3719.78s)]
*  Have they, what's the longest stretch? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3721.9s)]
*  What's the longest day you've had? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3724.34s)]
*  The comedy shows have you done in one day? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3726.0600000000004s)]
*  Did you do a three show day yet? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3727.7400000000002s)]
*  I did. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3729.38s)]
*  I'm, I'm about to experience what they call the car wash at the draft. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3729.82s)]
*  I got my schedule. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3733.5800000000004s)]
*  It's like, so Thursday morning, you're going to do get up and then you're [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3734.5s)]
*  going to do sports center and then you're going to do NFL live and then you're [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3737.7400000000002s)]
*  going to do, and I'm like, okay, all right, so we'll see how this goes. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3740.6600000000003s)]
*  But, uh, I'm an egomaniac. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3743.42s)]
*  I'm a narcissist. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3745.42s)]
*  I like seeing myself on TV and I'm cool with that. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3746.2200000000003s)]
*  You love this stuff though. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3749.3s)]
*  You'll you're ready to do multiple hours at a time. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3750.42s)]
*  I mean, you were just on get up an hour ago and now you're on this podcast. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3753.7400000000002s)]
*  You're ready to go. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3757.38s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3758.26s)]
*  Um, I'm excited. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3759.02s)]
*  And it's funny, like we're sitting in the get up production meeting and it's [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3760.1s)]
*  Marcus Morris and it's Damien Woody and it's Carlos Boozer and we're talking [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3763.98s)]
*  about the Knicks and you know, I'm a diehard Knicks fan and I'm just like trying [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3768.14s)]
*  to stay quiet because I'm here for NFL draft stuff and I just just feel my heart. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3772.74s)]
*  I'm like, I just can't watch even Chenzo hitting threes and Randall [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3776.58s)]
*  bullying LeBron and Hardenstein looking like he's an all world center. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3779.7s)]
*  And I'm looking at Carl Anthony towns, unable to score and Dennis Schroeder [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3783.06s)]
*  all up in a everyone's face or Schroeder. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3786.54s)]
*  Uh, it's like, so they let me talk about the Knicks, which was fun. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3789.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'll tell you, man, like all these ESPN shows, I was biting my tongue last [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3791.8999999999996s)]
*  week. It's like, if they don't get past the Celtics and the Cavs, is it a [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3797.4199999999996s)]
*  disappointment for the Knicks? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3800.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm like the Celtics and the Cavs, like I'm petrified of the Pistons and here [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3801.78s)]
*  we are and you're going to go to the game tonight or whatever and you're going [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3806.7000000000003s)]
*  to see Devin Chenzo and Randall light it up again. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3809.78s)]
*  And the Knicks had zero from Kat and zero from Mikhail Bridges when it mattered. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3812.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it does feel like the Knicks fans didn't have enough time to enjoy whatever [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3816.1800000000003s)]
*  the team that kind of blossomed last year was. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3821.02s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it just blew up. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3823.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't think I personally don't think Tibbs is the right coach for the team that [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3826.02s)]
*  they currently assembled. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3829.34s)]
*  And maybe we'll find that out after the year, whether they agree with me. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3831.02s)]
*  But, you know, they played the two games against the Pistons at home. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3833.86s)]
*  And they lost seven of the eight quarters, basically, no doubt. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3838.7400000000002s)]
*  And they look like the better team or the better coach team. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3841.94s)]
*  And, you know, campaign in the first game scores 14 and is like this huge spark [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3844.7000000000003s)]
*  plug off the bench. He gets three fouls early. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3849.6600000000003s)]
*  We don't see him the rest of the night. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3851.38s)]
*  And they had eight bench points, eight, and they're all from Deuce McBride. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3852.7000000000003s)]
*  None of them of great significance. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3856.82s)]
*  So as a Knicks fan, I'm sitting here and the series is tied at one, but I'm not [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3858.34s)]
*  exactly full of optimism. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3861.94s)]
*  But that's what I bring to ESPN. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3864.1800000000003s)]
*  That's what I bring. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3865.7400000000002s)]
*  Multi-sport capability, passion, optimism. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3867.1800000000003s)]
*  We're going to talk NFL draft, which we haven't talked about in the last, like, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3870.6200000000003s)]
*  five, six weeks as I've thrown myself into it. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3876.02s)]
*  I don't even know where to start because on the one hand, it feels like a draft [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3879.54s)]
*  that can go chalk. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3883.3s)]
*  You were on get up today reporting that teams are trying to trade up for two or [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3884.22s)]
*  three. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3889.58s)]
*  Yep. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3890.46s)]
*  And we don't even really know for who, whether it's like a Travis Hunter play as [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3891.3799999999997s)]
*  an Abdul Carter play is that I just refuse to believe Sanders is a top three [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3896.2999999999997s)]
*  pick at this point. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3900.54s)]
*  Even if the Giants want to take him at three, why wouldn't they just flip picks [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3901.98s)]
*  with the Patriots and try to get like a third round pick or anything? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3904.98s)]
*  Why would they take them at three? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3907.8599999999997s)]
*  Why don't move back? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3909.1s)]
*  I'm going to move back one spot. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3910.7000000000003s)]
*  I can't imagine in a million years he goes three. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3912.1s)]
*  I'm not even sure he goes in the first round. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3914.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't think Sidor Sanders was ever a top three pick. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3916.82s)]
*  This was my big treatise on the NFL draft world and the NFL. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3919.42s)]
*  Like, I really value what Mel Kuyper has to say. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3924.98s)]
*  And like, Daniel Jeremiah is like the best in the business. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3928.58s)]
*  And all of these different pundits on TV, like for a good month there after the [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3932.9s)]
*  combine, it was like, well, you've got, you know, Kim Ward, you got Abdul Carter, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3937.98s)]
*  you've got Travis Hunter, you got Sidor Sanders. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3942.98s)]
*  Like at no point in this process was anyone telling me that Sidor Sanders was a top [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3945.22s)]
*  five pick or a top 10 pick. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3951.18s)]
*  And then even when the Saints, like Nebula's Derek Carr injury, which I roll my [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3953.5s)]
*  eyes about, I don't know what's the story there, but Derek Carr is down. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3957.66s)]
*  Do you think that was an ooh my arm? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3961.02s)]
*  I think it's broken. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3961.9s)]
*  I can't say anything publicly. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3962.7400000000002s)]
*  Because then it comes out. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3967.82s)]
*  But like that one came out of nowhere. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3968.86s)]
*  I don't think the Saints saw that one coming. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3970.6600000000003s)]
*  Derek Carr shoulder and everyone just like, ooh, Saints are going to take them. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3972.94s)]
*  Like, guys, I think everyone's mistaking what we want Sidor Sanders to be into what [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3976.82s)]
*  the NFL evaluators see him as. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3982.3s)]
*  So here's my take on Sidor. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3983.98s)]
*  If he goes three to the Giants, this is one of those cases where they did all the work. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3986.7400000000002s)]
*  They feel comfortable with him. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3992.1000000000004s)]
*  And it's like, if we like him at 15 or we like him at 20 in this year's draft, who [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3993.66s)]
*  cares if it's not one of the blue chip guys, take him at three. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=3998.9s)]
*  We've got our quarterback. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4001.62s)]
*  We took him at three. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4002.74s)]
*  We're good. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4003.98s)]
*  This is the bone next Denver last year, right? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4004.74s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4007.14s)]
*  You know, like, I'm taking 12. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4007.7s)]
*  Blake Bortles to Jacksonville. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4012.5s)]
*  I remember that pick also. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4013.7s)]
*  He went third overall and it was like Blake Bortles third. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4014.9s)]
*  Like, and it was a big, if we like him as a quarterback in the first round and we [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4017.06s)]
*  have the third pick, like we're not going to get cute here. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4021.02s)]
*  So that's it with Sidor and we're recording this on Wednesday. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4023.02s)]
*  I could tell you there's a, there's a, sorry, what is today? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4027.3s)]
*  Today's Tuesday. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4032.2599999999998s)]
*  There is a meeting that's going to happen on Wednesday between John Marrow and all [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4033.62s)]
*  of the brain trust from the Giants and they're going to go through their draft [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4039.9s)]
*  board and they've talked, of course it's been fluid throughout, but like, this is [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4042.98s)]
*  one of those where does the owner step in and say, guys, I am not going through [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4046.46s)]
*  another draft year where we don't get a quarterback if we like Sidor, I'm okay [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4051.02s)]
*  with you taking a mat three. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4055.74s)]
*  Um, I don't see it happening right now. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4057.66s)]
*  I see a far more likely scenario being the Giants take Abdul Carter at three. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4059.7s)]
*  And then they trade back into the first round and get either Jackson [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4064.86s)]
*  Dart or Sidor Sanders. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4068.18s)]
*  But, uh, just to empty the bag a little bit on this whole thing, like the [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4069.66s)]
*  Giants have been to multiple Sidor Sanders games. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4073.82s)]
*  They have been to, I know Joe Shane himself was at a practice. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4077.78s)]
*  Earlier this year they went, they sent 13 people to the pro day. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4081.02s)]
*  He came to New Jersey. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4084.78s)]
*  They not only did a visit with him, they then took him out to dinner in Jersey. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4086.5s)]
*  And then last week they went back out there for a private workout, which I'm [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4091.06s)]
*  told went well that and Pat Shermer is his offensive coordinator at, you know, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4095.46s)]
*  in, and he's got great relationships with Dable and Shane. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4100.78s)]
*  So you've got like, if you don't want to look at the Dion side of it, there's [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4103.7s)]
*  also another voice in there. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4106.7s)]
*  That said, Joe Shane's daughter goes to Ole Miss. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4108.42s)]
*  He's been around that program a whole bunch. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4113.219999999999s)]
*  Uh, Joe Judge, former head coach of the Giants also works for [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4115.82s)]
*  Ole Miss football right now. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4119.62s)]
*  So there are people in the organization who are still employed by the Giants who [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4120.98s)]
*  can get the full story on Jackson Dart from Joe Judge, who still talks to those [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4124.94s)]
*  guys, Charlie Weiss is kid calls the plays Brian Dable and Charlie Weiss, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4128.78s)]
*  the Castilles have a long relationship. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4133.0199999999995s)]
*  So as much as we want to say like, well, they put all this time into [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4135.219999999999s)]
*  Shador, they know Jackson Dart also. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4138.219999999999s)]
*  So I am not convinced that Shador is this quarterback. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4141.0199999999995s)]
*  The Giants are certainly being linked to it. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4143.94s)]
*  I think Jackson Dart could easily be that guy as well. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4146.66s)]
*  Shepter had a tidbit about how, which I agree with that some organizations slash [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4150.5s)]
*  coaching staffs would be afraid of taking Sanders because Dion is just looming [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4156.54s)]
*  over you as you're replaced with this head coach. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4161.9800000000005s)]
*  The moment you take his son, which I think ties into what I see with the Giants. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4164.62s)]
*  And, you know, I have some Intel in the paths. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4169.26s)]
*  I think the paths don't, the paths don't know what the Giants are going to do. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4171.62s)]
*  And the paths are heading into this draft prepared to not know up until the [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4176.860000000001s)]
*  Giants are on the clock and then building out all their scenarios from there. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4180.820000000001s)]
*  But I think the Intel, a lot of people are having are you have the people who [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4185.22s)]
*  they might not be there in a year and the Giants, right? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4190.38s)]
*  The GM, the coach, well, they just can, can we just take the [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4192.66s)]
*  best possible player and whatever. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4196.74s)]
*  You have the long-term planning people who were like, maybe we, you know, maybe [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4199.139999999999s)]
*  we could turn this pick into a bigger asset and then you have the owner. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4204.34s)]
*  Who knows what the family thinks. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4208.139999999999s)]
*  So you basically have three different sides, all who have these vested interests. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4209.62s)]
*  Like what if Deball is like, I'm going to get fired unless we take [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4214.78s)]
*  Sanders at three and he's good. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4217.3s)]
*  If Sanders is at three and he's good, I might keep my job for a little bit. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4219.26s)]
*  He might also think the opposite way and be like, if we take Sanders, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4222.94s)]
*  I'm definitely getting fired. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4226.62s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4228.14s)]
*  So I just said, it's so interesting how many different agendas are going on and [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4228.9s)]
*  what a mess they've been for the last decade, which is just the fact. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4233.94s)]
*  The word, the word is a giant Delta on what, on what Sanders is draft stock [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4237.18s)]
*  could be and three is where it begins. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4241.42s)]
*  And I will not close the door on the Giants at three because of exactly what [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4243.34s)]
*  you're saying. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4246.82s)]
*  There's different agendas going on. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4247.38s)]
*  There also might be different evaluations and there's different philosophies on. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4249.219999999999s)]
*  Hey, if we draft Abdul Carter and he gets seven sacks and we're five and 12, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4253.179999999999s)]
*  like it doesn't, that doesn't help any of us. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4258.54s)]
*  And it doesn't necessarily do anything to strengthen the team far greater than [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4261.099999999999s)]
*  what they have, which is Brian Burns and Dexter Lawrence and Kavon Tibbito. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4264.179999999999s)]
*  They have defensive line. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4269.259999999999s)]
*  So it's not like this is some pressing need that would just be, Hey, he could [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4270.7s)]
*  be Micah Parsons or Hey, he could be Lawrence Taylor. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4274.1s)]
*  That's why you take him up at three, but Miles Garrett might be the best [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4277.02s)]
*  pass rusher in the sport. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4281.06s)]
*  There's been a lot of turnover in Cleveland since they took Miles Garrett. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4282.620000000001s)]
*  You get a quarterback and suddenly you say, okay, well, Dable's a quarterback guy. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4286.5s)]
*  You know, we've got to pay some time here to see this quarterback develop a little [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4291.54s)]
*  bit. That's why we have Ross. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4294.780000000001s)]
*  And then you kind of give yourself a little breathing room and say, well, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4296.780000000001s)]
*  there's obviously signs of development. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4299.26s)]
*  I would also add with the, the Shador thing, he could go three there. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4301.740000000001s)]
*  He could still be on the board at 34. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4307.740000000001s)]
*  So to me, this is one of those where, and I, I've said it and I get like, people [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4312.780000000001s)]
*  get caught up in the comparison, but not since Johnny Menzel have we had a [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4318.06s)]
*  prospect where I walked into draft night and said, this guy can go first overall, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4322.9800000000005s)]
*  or this guy doesn't even belong in the first round because of so many [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4327.620000000001s)]
*  differing opinions. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4330.82s)]
*  And my last point on Lamar had like what, like a 20 pick swing for where he could [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4332.86s)]
*  go. Like, it would have been shocking if he was in the high teens, it would have [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4337.7s)]
*  been shocking to fill the second round. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4341.58s)]
*  Yeah. And what's amazing about the Lamar one is that people forget the Ravens [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4343.299999999999s)]
*  took Hayden Hurst at 22. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4347.46s)]
*  So it's not like he was, it took a tight end and then they traded back and Lamar [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4349.58s)]
*  says, I'm going to get you guys a Superbowl ring. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4354.299999999999s)]
*  And it's like, all right, almost. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4355.78s)]
*  Well, sure enough, he's, he's everything you'd want more, but people forget that [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4357.0599999999995s)]
*  30 teams pass on them, including the Baltimore Ravens. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4360.98s)]
*  Well, that's the Patriots and Brady. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4364.66s)]
*  They passed on them in the fourth round and the fifth round. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4366.219999999999s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4368.5s)]
*  And then they took them in the sixth round. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4368.86s)]
*  So it's like smart, but you also passed on them. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4370.46s)]
*  The Dion thing is interesting. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4373.0199999999995s)]
*  So Shador Sanders has never played for a coach other than his dad. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4374.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4378.82s)]
*  In high school and in college. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4379.74s)]
*  Red flag. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4381.98s)]
*  What's up? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4383.299999999999s)]
*  Is that a red flag or is that just weird? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4384.219999999999s)]
*  I asked the question and then it's, well, he didn't do that. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4385.98s)]
*  He just plays for his father and that's fine. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4389.94s)]
*  The other side of it is like Dion's shadow might be large, but like, if you're [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4394.099999999999s)]
*  a coach and you're that insecure, then you probably have your own issues. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4398.66s)]
*  Like Mike Tomlin is the reason I would think Pittsburgh makes sense because [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4402.58s)]
*  Mike Tomlin is not going to be, he's not going to be nervous of like Dion Sanders [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4406.7s)]
*  talking in the media locally about his son. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4411.54s)]
*  That said, you go to a weaker coaching staff in a weaker market and they're one [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4414.179999999999s)]
*  in seven and should do are still not on the field Dion Dion might have something [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4418.82s)]
*  to say a couple other things just because I asked you a quick before you do the [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4424.5s)]
*  couple other things. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4428.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4429.0199999999995s)]
*  What's the craziest team in round one that could take should door that you think [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4431.099999999999s)]
*  there's actually like a 1% chance it could happen. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4438.82s)]
*  So it's completely insane, but also you could see it. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4441.82s)]
*  Is there a team? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4446.099999999999s)]
*  There's, there's, there's two teams. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4447.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4449.379999999999s)]
*  Not at 11, but you're telling me should door still on the board at 30, 31, 32. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4450.86s)]
*  And we've got Brock Purdy talking about where he wants and what he wants to San [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4456.74s)]
*  Francisco, you know, pull the plug and just say, screw it. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4462.5s)]
*  We'll take two young quarterbacks. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4465.46s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4466.5s)]
*  We'll still sign for maybe, you know, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4467.219999999999s)]
*  but not at 11, but maybe a trade back. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4469.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4472.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4473.299999999999s)]
*  And then Seattle who gave Sam Darnold a three year deal, but there's a lot of [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4474.14s)]
*  ways out of that three year deal after the first year or second year. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4478.98s)]
*  And if Seattle was to look at things and say, we like should door and let's just [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4483.5s)]
*  give ourselves some security here behind him. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4488.58s)]
*  Um, that would be two teams that I think that no one's talking about. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4490.66s)]
*  That could be a possibility. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4494.14s)]
*  San Francisco one would be a giant leverage play just to press it to Purdy [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4495.0199999999995s)]
*  and put him in a corner because he's there. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4499.26s)]
*  Those contract talks are going on right now. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4501.22s)]
*  And I don't think they'd ever waste a first round pick to just make a point. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4503.299999999999s)]
*  I think Purdy is the guy they want, but you talk about him slipping. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4506.0199999999995s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4509.82s)]
*  All right. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4510.86s)]
*  We'll hold on the Niners cause I'm going to come back to them. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4511.139999999999s)]
*  What was your couple other things that you had off this? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4513.179999999999s)]
*  You know, Dion has a lot of people that he's done work with and works with in [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4515.339999999999s)]
*  the media. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4522.179999999999s)]
*  So I think there's been a little bit of like the sensitivity of, of being [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4523.179999999999s)]
*  negative on Sjodor and I don't know if it's, if it's helped Sjodor in the long [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4527.54s)]
*  run, cause now if Sjodor doesn't go in the first 20 picks, it's this great slide [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4531.34s)]
*  and the thing, but, you know, Dion worked for CBS Dion worked for NFL network for [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4536.02s)]
*  many years. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4540.18s)]
*  Dion has obviously great relationships with Fox and he's got a show on to be, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4541.18s)]
*  he's got a documentary on Amazon. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4545.58s)]
*  Like we all love Dion who worked in the media at any spot with him. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4547.3s)]
*  And like I worked with Dion in NFL network. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4552.26s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4554.18s)]
*  And he's like, Oh, great, great. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4555.18s)]
*  So I think this whole lead up to the draft, the people who have been talking [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4557.179999999999s)]
*  about the draft are careful. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4562.9s)]
*  I don't know if that's done him any favors. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4565.0199999999995s)]
*  If there is a slide in the draft that would also add. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4566.66s)]
*  And meanwhile, people are saying like, Hey, he might be Andy Dalton, Teddy [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4570.0199999999995s)]
*  Bridgewater, like that level. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4573.219999999999s)]
*  That's probably the ceiling. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4574.54s)]
*  I think your guy McShay had some things to say out of the combine and it was as [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4575.9s)]
*  if he had like, you know, said something about, he's been consistent this whole [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4579.42s)]
*  time, he just doesn't have them as a top 25 guy period. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4583.0599999999995s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4586.419999999999s)]
*  And you know, for Todd to do that, that's him going out on a limb. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4587.0599999999995s)]
*  I think some other people have been out there saying, I don't see him as this [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4589.74s)]
*  guy, but it's a lot safer just to say, ah, yeah, we like Shador, but when the [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4593.54s)]
*  rubber hits the road, who's going to be there answering the questions as to why [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4598.58s)]
*  is he slipping out? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4603.5s)]
*  Well, after, after Nick's last year, I just think that's the league now. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4604.179999999999s)]
*  If you like your guy, what, what, who cares? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4609.0599999999995s)]
*  Who's going to remember 10 years ago, what number in the draft he was? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4612.299999999999s)]
*  Like if you want your guy, you want your guy. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4615.38s)]
*  And if you talk yourself into a QB, which is the make or break position [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4617.06s)]
*  every year, you're going to do it. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4620.18s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter where you take them. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4621.86s)]
*  Three is too high. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4623.42s)]
*  I would, I would also add this with the Shador thing. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4624.900000000001s)]
*  So obviously all eyes have been on him. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4627.900000000001s)]
*  Huge spotlight. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4630.26s)]
*  They had reality shows at Amazon. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4631.62s)]
*  Um, you know, Dion has the famous video of him with the amazing, you know, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4633.74s)]
*  draft day look at Andrew Kramer in his living room. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4638.26s)]
*  I don't know what the plans are to cover Shador during draft day, but like, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4641.740000000001s)]
*  if there's 10 cameras in his living room and we've got, you know, wall to wall [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4647.62s)]
*  coverage of him, that tells me they know something. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4652.46s)]
*  And if there isn't that, that tells me that this thing is still very undetermined. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4655.18s)]
*  So I would almost approach the day of the draft and see, okay, well, let's see [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4658.62s)]
*  how much access we have to the Sanders family now, all that could be moot and [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4663.860000000001s)]
*  they're doing their own documentary and maybe they're filming something that we [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4667.18s)]
*  don't even know about and they've already sold the rights to, to Fubo or [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4669.78s)]
*  to Netflix or whoever, but like these guys have never shied away from the [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4673.3s)]
*  spotlight and I'd be curious to see how much spotlight and attention that they're [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4678.0199999999995s)]
*  getting or they're asking for on the day of the draft. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4682.54s)]
*  Did Fubo come after you when you were a free agent or was there a Fubo talks? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4685.099999999999s)]
*  No Fubo talks. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4689.9s)]
*  Can we just all agree? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4691.62s)]
*  And maybe I'm saying this selfishly as a Pats fan with the fourth pick in a [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4693.86s)]
*  three-part draft, um, the most fun outcome to all of this is the Pats and [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4697.14s)]
*  Giants flip picks, the Pats take Carter, Sanders goes to the Giants at four. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4703.14s)]
*  And we just get to talk about that for the rest of the off season, heading [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4711.54s)]
*  into the thing and maybe he's a little better than we thought and the Giants [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4714.780000000001s)]
*  fans will talk themselves into him almost immediately. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4718.1s)]
*  Um, them taking Carter is just a weird pick. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4720.900000000001s)]
*  That's another piece of this. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4725.46s)]
*  Like that team needed, that team has holes everywhere. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4726.58s)]
*  I would say the only thing they don't really need to address in the [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4730.62s)]
*  2025 draft is the defensive line. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4733.7s)]
*  They've got one, they've got one of the better young defensive lines in football. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4737.0199999999995s)]
*  You could argue Dexter Lawrence is the best defensive tackle in the sport. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4739.98s)]
*  And then Tibbetto is entering his fifth year. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4743.42s)]
*  So obviously he's got a contract situation that's looming. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4746.42s)]
*  And then on the other hand for Burns, like Burns, they spent a lot of money on [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4749.38s)]
*  Burns. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4752.62s)]
*  You're almost like, do you take Carter or like you, maybe you shop Tibbetto [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4752.86s)]
*  at that point and you just decide not to pay him. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4755.7s)]
*  Like I, for a team that has holes everywhere, it just seems like such a [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4757.5s)]
*  weird pick to me, but that's how top of this draft is until we get to Gentie. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4761.74s)]
*  Who's the wild card of everything. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4767.46s)]

*  Here's my promise. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4909.58s)]
*  It's a position that, you know, you think back to when Zeke Elliott was in the [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4911.34s)]
*  draft and he was awesome. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4915.5s)]
*  That was 2016 and he seems like he's a hundred years old now and he's like 31. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4916.82s)]
*  Um, it's a seven, eight year shelf life. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4921.86s)]
*  You might get the guy in the rookie contract plus one more contract. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4924.62s)]
*  If you get eight, nine, 10 years out of a running back, it's amazing. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4928.82s)]
*  And yet he has a chance to be immediately one of the top five guys at his position. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4933.18s)]
*  Now it's a position that when you're paying for it, when you see like free agency [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4938.86s)]
*  and you see the numbers, different positions get, what did Barkley get? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4942.82s)]
*  What was his last contract? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4947.0199999999995s)]
*  Like 16, 17 a year. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4948.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4949.9s)]
*  You got a new extension from the Eagles. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4950.1s)]
*  It finally got made whole, but it was [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4951.62s)]
*  in range. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4953.78s)]
*  It was 12. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4954.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4955.219999999999s)]
*  Or 12. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4955.9s)]
*  So McCaffrey is like somewhere in the 12th to 14 with some bonus. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4956.38s)]
*  McCaffrey and Saquon both are like 16, 17 right now. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4961.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4964.259999999999s)]
*  So the high end is 16, 17. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4964.58s)]
*  If I have one of the top five left tackles, that high end is, you know, in the [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4966.94s)]
*  high twenties, if I have one of the best nose tackles, that high end is what the [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4971.9s)]
*  Patriots played Williams. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4977.139999999999s)]
*  That's, you know, that's in the mid twenties. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4978.299999999999s)]
*  If I have a cornerback or receive cornerback might be high twenties receiver. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4980.58s)]
*  The market now is like low thirties quarterback is 50 edge rusher. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4985.78s)]
*  That's in the thirties now. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4992.38s)]
*  So I look at like where the pats are picking it for, and it's like, you can [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4994.3s)]
*  take Gentoo, you have a top five guy at your position going forward, but it's a [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=4998.22s)]
*  position that is valued at 13 to 16 million a year at the highest possible end [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5002.18s)]
*  of it, but if you take the edge rusher from Georgia and he's good, that's now [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5009.38s)]
*  like a $28 million a year guy. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5015.38s)]
*  So I don't understand why teams don't just think this way. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5018.02s)]
*  Like what is, what are the best players worth in our salary cap and why don't [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5020.5s)]
*  they just shift their drafts that way? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5024.78s)]
*  But they don't think that way. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5026.34s)]
*  Well, they're not thinking about the second contract. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5027.58s)]
*  They're thinking about the first one. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5031.66s)]
*  And if you get a guy who can get you 10 sacks to 15 sacks in the first round and [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5032.9400000000005s)]
*  you're paying him rookie numbers for the first four years, well, then you're [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5037.18s)]
*  getting the biggest bang for your buck. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5041.02s)]
*  And eventually you have to, you're getting an $8 million guy for that's worth 28. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5042.54s)]
*  Who's getting you 15 sacks. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5048.14s)]
*  That's why, like, I, I would just be talking about this constantly. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5049.740000000001s)]
*  If I ran an NFL team, like that's why the Will Campbell thing, if Will Campbell [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5053.66s)]
*  goes for, and he's the 15th best left tackle in the league, it's like, that sucks. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5058.1s)]
*  We don't even have one of the best 14 left tackles, but he's still worth like [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5062.3s)]
*  29 million a year as a left tackle. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5066.26s)]
*  And here's, here's the run. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5068.900000000001s)]
*  Like everyone I've spoken to is obsessed with Genthe. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5070.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5075.58s)]
*  Seems like it is a home run. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5075.9400000000005s)]
*  This is, there is no holes in his game. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5078.26s)]
*  The, the pushback I got last night. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5080.18s)]
*  Like a rich man, Jameer Gibbs, basically. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5082.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5084.900000000001s)]
*  And, and he, he's so small to the ground. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5085.22s)]
*  Like his way he runs, he does the upright and then he goes low. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5087.58s)]
*  It's, you cannot bring him down. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5090.9800000000005s)]
*  And what he did in the college level, like there's a lot of stuff about him [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5093.14s)]
*  that you'll want to run through a wall for the fact that he was offered crazy [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5096.1s)]
*  money in NIL going into his last year. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5100.42s)]
*  And he's like, no, I've got a job to do at Boise. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5102.02s)]
*  I'm staying at, but that's the, it goes a long way in today's day and age of NIL. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5104.42s)]
*  When these coaches and GMs are talking to players who've been to four colleges [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5109.46s)]
*  each to take the more dollar sign, you know, each time. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5112.5s)]
*  It's like my guy, Drake May in North Carolina. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5116.02s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5118.22s)]
*  My home is here. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5118.9800000000005s)]
*  And UNC. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5119.5s)]
*  Had to finish it out. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5120.46s)]
*  My little kids are here. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5121.26s)]
*  That's it. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5122.26s)]
*  It's planted roots. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5123.34s)]
*  Uh, here, here's where the rub is. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5125.38s)]
*  And then the pushback is last year. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5127.82s)]
*  There are all these running backs in the draft. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5131.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you know who the leading rusher of all the rookie running backs was? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5133.099999999999s)]
*  It was Bucky Irving, who was a fourth round pick. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5136.179999999999s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5138.9s)]
*  The second leading rusher of all the rookies was Tyrone Tracy for the giants [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5140.0199999999995s)]
*  who quietly put together a thousand yard season while everyone was crying [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5144.46s)]
*  about Saquon leaving, like he, he did basically what Saquon did the year [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5147.66s)]
*  before in that Giants offense. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5151.38s)]
*  Um, so. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5153.42s)]
*  The opportunity cost of missing out and the gap of, okay, well, you know, we, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5154.66s)]
*  we get Genthe, he could be amazing. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5160.82s)]
*  And Jameer Gibbs was behind the best offensive line in football. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5162.78s)]
*  And in a lot of ways, Saquon last year took this giant leap, not because, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5166.14s)]
*  yes, Saquon's amazing, but he also was behind that Jeff Stathlin offensive line. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5170.54s)]
*  And it was a perfect fit. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5174.42s)]
*  If your team has a ton of holes and your offensive line isn't great, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5176.14s)]
*  taking a running back when, oh, I don't know, a left tackle or a pass rusher. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5180.38s)]
*  However, Bill, this draft, there's three great players in this draft. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5185.3s)]
*  And I will say that there are three great players. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5188.86s)]
*  It's Carter, it's Hunter, and it's Genthe. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5191.26s)]
*  So if there ever was a year where you take a guy in the top five at running back, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5193.0199999999995s)]
*  if you're Jacksonville, close your eyes, you take Genthe, you put them in there, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5197.139999999999s)]
*  you have your running back, and then you deal with everything. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5200.98s)]
*  And you know, you have that guy because at five Mason Graham or Ted McMillan, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5203.099999999999s)]
*  like those are questions. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5208.5s)]
*  Genthe is a sure thing. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5210.1s)]
*  This guy is awesome. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5211.46s)]
*  So this is the year for a top five running back because of the rest of that class up top. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5212.5s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5217.94s)]
*  I just was looking up as you were talking the 2023 draft. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5219.18s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5222.9s)]
*  Bijan goes eight to Atlanta. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5224.46s)]
*  Solid pick. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5227.34s)]
*  Everybody was like, one of the best running back prospects of the last decade. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5228.62s)]
*  This guy's awesome. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5234.42s)]
*  I like it. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5236.38s)]
*  Jalen Carter goes ninth. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5237.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5240.38s)]
*  What's a more important position? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5241.0199999999995s)]
*  Who's going to make more money on their second contract? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5242.94s)]
*  Like you think it's like now you look back and like, wow, that was stupid. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5245.94s)]
*  Now there are reasons Jalen Carter fell to nine. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5249.139999999999s)]
*  Look, who'd the Raiders pick at seven that year? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5251.219999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5253.339999999999s)]
*  Tyree Wilson. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5254.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5255.219999999999s)]
*  So you pass on Jalen Carter for Tyree Wilson. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5255.86s)]
*  However, Bill, if you put Jalen Carter in Vegas, is it the same situation? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5257.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5261.339999999999s)]
*  I, it's a great question. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5262.66s)]
*  Jamiro Gibbs goes 12. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5265.14s)]
*  You were all excited about, we were doing podcasts that year and you were like, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5266.54s)]
*  this is an amazing pick. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5269.860000000001s)]
*  This is like a toy for the lions that this weapon they just get to use and move around. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5271.14s)]
*  I think the difference with Gentie that would really fuck with me if I was in a [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5277.1s)]
*  draft room is that he's just three downs. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5281.820000000001s)]
*  You have a guy who doesn't basically have to come off the field who can play [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5285.22s)]
*  however many, you know, downs, touches, whatever. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5289.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5294.0199999999995s)]
*  I look at the Patriots, they don't have enough, you know, left tackle, but they [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5294.18s)]
*  had him and Drake May is it, does this become Peyton Manning, Edger James for, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5298.26s)]
*  you know, seven years and you can keep them on, you know, third down. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5303.18s)]
*  Now, now he's like probably our best receiver field. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5307.54s)]
*  Anyway, I don't think they should take them at four, but I'm sure [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5310.58s)]
*  they've had the conversation, but it seems like if he goes to the bears at 10. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5314.0599999999995s)]
*  I wonder if that's like a Gibbs kind of toy situation, like, Whoa, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5318.34s)]
*  I don't see him going past 10. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5323.42s)]
*  I don't either. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5325.42s)]
*  Um, I look at New Orleans at nine, Kamara is the last year of his deal and. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5326.62s)]
*  You know, Kellen Moore, new coach. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5332.179999999999s)]
*  Um, that's a tough beat for New Orleans though, who has 40 holes. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5334.3s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5337.74s)]
*  But what's your identity going to be your first pick of the new coach? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5338.58s)]
*  Like what, what are you going to be? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5342.5s)]
*  If Gentie's there, I like that. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5344.38s)]
*  I, I mean, I like it. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5345.78s)]
*  I like it at six, obviously. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5348.179999999999s)]
*  I think there's a little too much about the Raiders that that tells me if they're [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5349.38s)]
*  talking about Gentie so much usually, but to me, five Jacksonville, James [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5352.5s)]
*  Gladstone, interesting guy, 34 year old new GM from the Rams and Liam Cohen. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5358.7s)]
*  Like Schaftor had it in his column on Sunday and I've heard the same thing. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5365.26s)]
*  They're going offense. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5369.14s)]
*  Um, what's our identity going to be? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5370.62s)]
*  Now, if you're James Gladstone coming from the Rams where character was everything [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5372.34s)]
*  when they did their board and they had a whole philosophy and I've been in the [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5376.54s)]
*  room with less and with McVeigh and it's like, what do we stand for? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5379.18s)]
*  What is Ted McMillan? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5383.02s)]
*  Great player. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5385.42s)]
*  Great kid. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5386.46s)]
*  The questions are, does he love football? [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5388.38s)]
*  It is his heart in this. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5390.62s)]
*  He took plays off. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5391.9400000000005s)]
*  Is that going to be your first pick as a GM of a team? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5393.22s)]
*  This is what we stand for. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5397.22s)]
*  This is my rep, Ted McMillan. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5398.06s)]
*  This is my guy. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5399.660000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5400.34s)]
*  Ashton Gentie. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5401.54s)]
*  You can look at everyone in that room and say, this is what we're about. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5402.3s)]
*  This kid right here, this is what we stand for. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5404.780000000001s)]
*  And this is what Jaguars football is going to be. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5406.9400000000005s)]
*  So I think he could go as high as five. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5408.86s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5410.58s)]
*  First guy in the locker room every morning. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5411.38s)]
*  Last guy to leave. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5413.099999999999s)]
*  Let's got to leave. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5414.58s)]
*  Warrior. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5415.339999999999s)]
*  I don't know why we haven't heard more about the Patriots taking them. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5416.46s)]
*  You know, to me, their team has been lacking offensive firepower. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5422.139999999999s)]
*  And if Campbell's not Orlando Pace or Jonathan Ogden, then why is he such a slam dunk? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5426.54s)]
*  So to me, it's not my pick. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5431.0599999999995s)]
*  Elliot Wolf and Mike Vrabel will make it. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5432.74s)]
*  And I hear that there's a lot of love for Campbell in that building and great. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5434.94s)]
*  Um, Abdul Carter would be a wonderful selection at four as well. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5438.620000000001s)]
*  But like for whatever reason, Gentie has been like crossed off the list from Patriots, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5441.620000000001s)]
*  but then the Jaguars, it's like, yep, that works for us. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5445.22s)]
*  Couple of things in Campbell's favor, just in general, Van Lathan, giant OSU fan [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5447.580000000001s)]
*  absolutely loves him. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5451.9400000000005s)]
*  Thinks he's a warrior. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5452.740000000001s)]
*  He was in the ESCC just battling. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5453.580000000001s)]
*  I'll give Van credit. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5455.22s)]
*  He was big on Brian Thomas last year. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5456.38s)]
*  Van and Jaden Daniels was another one. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5457.9800000000005s)]
*  He absolutely loved Jaden Daniels. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5460.34s)]
*  Fans been good. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5461.860000000001s)]
*  And Van watches every play. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5462.620000000001s)]
*  Cause I didn't see Nas Reed being this at an LSU and Nas Reed doesn't miss a shot. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5463.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't remember his Nas Reed takes, um, Campbell. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5467.7s)]
*  So he shows up, what is he 18 as a freshman and he's just immediately. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5471.98s)]
*  Thrown into the fire like a man's man leader played every play tough as nails. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5477.26s)]
*  I heard this tidbit about Vrabel, but I don't know if you've heard it. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5484.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5487.86s)]
*  And it seems insane and I loved it. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5489.38s)]
*  And I'm going to share it here. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5491.06s)]
*  Apparently when he's working out people, he has this thing about body [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5492.82s)]
*  mass and feeling like banging bodies. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5497.9s)]
*  And if it's the right kind of player that they're looking at, who actually put on [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5501.0599999999995s)]
*  the pads and bounce against them to feel what their body's like, like he's a big, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5504.86s)]
*  how sturdy are you, how physical? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5510.7s)]
*  He's done it at pro days. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5512.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5514.419999999999s)]
*  So you know about this? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5514.7s)]
*  He'll do it. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5515.459999999999s)]
*  There's no way he's retired for 15 years. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5516.78s)]
*  He'll do wrestling moves with the player and get him in all these weird positions [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5519.26s)]
*  to see how he reacts. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5522.62s)]
*  No, it's real. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5523.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5524.46s)]
*  So I would say like, will Campbell who poor will Campbell that his [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5525.06s)]
*  arms aren't an inch longer, right? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5529.26s)]
*  It's an inch is like this big, by the way. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5531.900000000001s)]
*  And it's like, Oh, I couldn't get to 34 inches. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5534.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5537.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's a bunch of like Sean Slater has been pretty good. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5538.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5541.900000000001s)]
*  Now it's a knock on him. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5542.58s)]
*  Joe, Joe Thomas has been okay. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5543.42s)]
*  Yep. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5546.02s)]
*  Um, but I just feels like we'll Campbell, I could see Bray will put in the pads on [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5546.14s)]
*  them and hitting them and be like, yeah, this is my kind of body mass guy. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5550.14s)]
*  I just think they're going to take them. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5553.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5555.22s)]
*  And it's like, look, if he, maybe he won't ever be that one of the eight best left [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5555.42s)]
*  tackles in the league, but this is a guy who would be, he's going to be a leader. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5560.26s)]
*  He's durable. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5564.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, and he will be in the top half of left tackles, which is all you need. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5566.06s)]
*  Cause you can't find them. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5570.860000000001s)]
*  They're not falling out of trees. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5572.54s)]
*  Period. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5574.34s)]
*  Is it a great, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5574.9800000000005s)]
*  is it a great failure and a great disappointment if a year in you're like, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5575.86s)]
*  he's a good left tackle, but gosh, he's an amazing left guard. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5580.62s)]
*  And do we move him inside and do we put someone else on time? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5586.34s)]
*  You be a four time all pro at left guard. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5590.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, I, is that a, is that a loss? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5592.42s)]
*  Quinton Nelson went six, a loss for the Colts. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5594.78s)]
*  Like, no, no, no, he's great. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5598.26s)]
*  He was the best at his position for a decade. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5600.98s)]
*  Like I think he'd sign up for that. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5602.98s)]
*  But that's what, when you're picking fourth or you're picking fifth or you're [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5604.14s)]
*  picking third, if you're in the top five, I have to get a blue chipper. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5607.02s)]
*  And the only way I'm not doing that as if, if there's some quarterback that I'm [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5611.5s)]
*  doing my 50, 50 coin toss on. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5615.06s)]
*  And bill last year, Malik neighbors was a blue chipper. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5617.18s)]
*  Um, Joe alt was a blue chipper this year. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5620.26s)]
*  I hate to be so dismissive and I think it actually adds to the [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5623.34s)]
*  intrigue of the draft. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5625.5s)]
*  They're just not there. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5626.58s)]
*  You can't make Will Campbell into a blue chipper. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5627.3s)]
*  You just can't. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5629.860000000001s)]
*  So he's looked at it. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5630.54s)]
*  What did that guy from Pittsburgh who nobody had ever heard of who signed [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5632.780000000001s)]
*  as a free agent, the left tackle more. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5635.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5638.780000000001s)]
*  Did he get like 20 million a year? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5639.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5642.06s)]
*  And, and everybody was like, we're not sure he's a starter. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5642.54s)]
*  So when you think of it that way, if Campbell could just be the 14th best [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5645.900000000001s)]
*  left tackle in the league, if that's his ceiling, it's like, well, that's [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5651.14s)]
*  probably a $29 million player. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5654.02s)]
*  You have them for five years. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5656.46s)]
*  Armand Membou were known and ever heard of, and that's dismissive. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5657.900000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't say it that way, but he wasn't. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5660.46s)]
*  No, he was a fast riser though. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5661.74s)]
*  There's no question. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5663.54s)]
*  He was definitely coming on strong and then the combine was an [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5664.42s)]
*  absolute revelation. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5666.62s)]
*  So if you're talking about arm length and that stuff and Campbell, maybe [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5669.139999999999s)]
*  Membou's a tackle. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5673.54s)]
*  He's a pure tackle and he has huge upside. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5674.82s)]
*  I would always take the pedigree of the blue chipper who's done it, but I'm [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5679.0199999999995s)]
*  the same guy who would have taken Mac Jones over Trey Lance, you know, like, I [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5683.3s)]
*  like knowing what I'm getting. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5687.219999999999s)]
*  And you look at some of these teams, like the Chargers last year, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5688.58s)]
*  their first four picks were out of Notre Dame, you know, Michigan, Alabama, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5691.62s)]
*  USC, like that. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5697.22s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5698.66s)]
*  Membou comes out of Missouri, doesn't have the same pedigree, doesn't have [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5700.22s)]
*  the same sort of resume, but is this physical freak. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5703.9s)]
*  Where do you stand on Membou versus Campbell who you know what you're [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5707.78s)]
*  getting with Will Campbell? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5711.0599999999995s)]
*  It's solid. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5711.94s)]
*  It's a guy as solid as a rock, but he might not ever end up being, like I said, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5712.5s)]
*  an Orlando Pace or a Trent Williams or a Jonathan Ogden type. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5716.38s)]
*  Obviously I've done a lot of Membou work. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5720.3s)]
*  So I have two questions. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5723.74s)]
*  One, did Vrabel put the pads on with him yet? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5724.82s)]
*  Bang and feel them out and put them in some wrestling moves. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5728.46s)]
*  Does Vrabel like his body mass? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5731.02s)]
*  That would be one. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5733.02s)]
*  I do know this. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5733.9800000000005s)]
*  I do know this. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5734.9s)]
*  The Patriots have been doing work on Membou and this is this week. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5735.46s)]
*  They've made some calls and they've been asking around. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5738.14s)]
*  So that door is not shut yet. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5739.9800000000005s)]
*  So this is, this is what I know and what I've heard with the Pats where there's [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5742.54s)]
*  two types of players you're picking, right? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5748.38s)]
*  And Belichick, I think his, his mistake, especially over the last 10 years was he [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5750.02s)]
*  would default toward these winning programs, you know, and you're getting [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5754.74s)]
*  guys from LSU, Alabama who have already been maximized because those teams have [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5758.1s)]
*  the greatest possible college coaching staff. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5762.7s)]
*  So you're getting somebody out of there and they've already been really well [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5764.7s)]
*  schooled, they've been, whatever's in there, a lot of it's been pulled out. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5767.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's how, why it's safer bets to take some of these guys, right? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5772.02s)]
*  The question for the Pats is they have an awesome coaching staff now that [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5776.02s)]
*  they feel really good about. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5780.42s)]
*  And can you look at some of these guys from schools that maybe, maybe weren't [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5782.740000000001s)]
*  the greatest, maybe didn't have like a defensive coordinator making $2 million [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5788.740000000001s)]
*  a year or whatever, and maybe there's, there's some raw gem stuff for there. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5793.900000000001s)]
*  And it's like, well, what, what happens if we take this raw, awesome piece of [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5799.34s)]
*  something who's already has blue chip talent and we pull him into our [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5803.38s)]
*  universe and we coach him up? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5807.26s)]
*  I think that's what Washington thought last year was some of their guys, right? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5809.34s)]
*  They thought like they went and got these B-list veterans, put a bunch of like [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5812.86s)]
*  smart, just tough vets, and then kind of took some chances on that guy was [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5817.3s)]
*  never in the right situation. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5823.54s)]
*  Let's, let's give him a test drive. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5824.78s)]
*  Cause we love our nucleus. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5826.38s)]
*  I think that's how the Pats are feeling, which is why I think Membo [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5827.9800000000005s)]
*  can't be ruled out at four. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5830.46s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5832.74s)]
*  And the, the, the Washington approach, which was Adam Peters, who has a history [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5833.86s)]
*  with new England, was exactly what you said, let's get a veteran for every [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5838.5s)]
*  position group and that was Zach Ertz and Austin Eckler and Marcus Mariota and [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5842.94s)]
*  Fred, Frankie Louvue and Zach, you go through all these guys that were not [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5846.94s)]
*  hot, but let's also get assisting coaches. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5851.54s)]
*  No doubt are overqualified at all these different spots, which is kind of what [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5854.0599999999995s)]
*  the Pats are doing. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5858.139999999999s)]
*  And then they took a guy like Mike Santastril in the draft, who [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5858.98s)]
*  everyone was like, well, he's a nickel. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5861.82s)]
*  He's not really worthy of having. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5863.099999999999s)]
*  And then it was an all world rookie for the commanders out of the gate. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5864.54s)]
*  Um, I pushed back on the Patriots thing at the end of Belichick's stay. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5868.42s)]
*  It was like Kyle Dugger from Lenore Rhyne. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5871.82s)]
*  And then he took Cole Strange. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5875.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, right. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5876.42s)]
*  Well, they went older. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5877.259999999999s)]
*  That was a new strategy near the end. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5878.219999999999s)]
*  Older guys who they could come in right away and be plug and play, which [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5879.98s)]
*  also didn't really work that way. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5883.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5886.219999999999s)]
*  I'm curious about the Patriots. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5886.66s)]
*  I, I do think I wasn't like my report today is real. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5888.299999999999s)]
*  Cleveland is getting calls. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5891.9s)]
*  Does Cleveland just say, you know what? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5893.94s)]
*  We're not a Travis Hunter away from being revel. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5895.46s)]
*  They should a hundred percent trade back. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5899.139999999999s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5900.78s)]
*  Or the giants, they have more complicated to win a Superbowl for three years. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5901.98s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5906.299999999999s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5907.259999999999s)]
*  So don't be shocked if Cleveland on Thursday we're on the clock. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5907.78s)]
*  Well, Cleveland's traded and then some aggressive team that is a [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5911.66s)]
*  couple steps away, made the move. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5914.98s)]
*  And because it's such a kind of depleted draft and because it's not a [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5917.0599999999995s)]
*  quarterback, it won't be the same bounty of picks that you usually [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5920.86s)]
*  get to move up to number two. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5924.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5926.46s)]
*  But who, what team is that? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5926.62s)]

*  It's not, I don't think it's the Raiders. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5932.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't think it's the right jets. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5934.58s)]
*  The Panthers are too far away. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5936.38s)]

*  Maybe if I were them, I wouldn't. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5942.86s)]
*  I, the bears were the one I was. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5944.259999999999s)]
*  Bears are a trade back team. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5946.0599999999995s)]
*  I think the bears are a trade back team. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5947.5s)]
*  Well, cause they have some talent. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5949.38s)]
*  I look at the Niners, the Niners window, right? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5950.66s)]
*  Like now they've done this before. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5953.54s)]
*  They went up and got trade lands. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5955.98s)]
*  I don't see it. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5958.26s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5968.62s)]
*  I'm just throwing out teams that are a playoff team that didn't have what they [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5969.099999999999s)]
*  thought they should be that are still in the team that does seem crazy to me as [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5974.42s)]
*  the Raiders, just because new coach, new coach, mid seventies, Tom Brady, making [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5977.46s)]
*  a splash, they fall in love with Hunter. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5983.5s)]
*  They think he can play both ways. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5986.14s)]
*  And, um, wait, are you, do you, from what you, you talk to everybody and you do the [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5988.02s)]
*  on, on the record, then off the record and you love hearing like little tidbits about [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5993.82s)]
*  character and all the, all the stuff that sometimes you can't even use injury stuff. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=5997.42s)]
*  Is anyone worried about Carter and, and the stress coming out foot? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6001.62s)]
*  It's not a stress fracture, but it's not great either. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6006.14s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6008.740000000001s)]
*  I'll say this. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6011.26s)]
*  His dad, like there's like all this stuff. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6012.42s)]
*  It's, it's Travis Hunter. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6017.54s)]
*  It's a Bucca out of, out of Ohio state. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6019.3s)]
*  It's Gentie and you hear about Jalen Walker. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6021.58s)]
*  These are amazing kids. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6023.820000000001s)]
*  Then Carter comes up and it's guy can play and he was tough. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6024.900000000001s)]
*  So I think there's some stuff about, you know, is this the all world guy? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6029.780000000001s)]
*  But I'll tell you what Charles Haley wasn't the all world guy and he won five [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6034.82s)]
*  championships. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6038.7s)]
*  Well, listen, if you're a great edge rusher, you gotta be a little selfish. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6039.58s)]
*  Like that position, like it is what it is. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6042.74s)]
*  You're not going to be a team guide. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6045.299999999999s)]
*  You just trying to get the quarterback. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6046.78s)]
*  That's it. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6048.0599999999995s)]
*  The Giants passed on Michael Parsons a few years ago. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6048.94s)]
*  They traded back and they ended up getting Kaderius Tony and they got an additional [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6051.54s)]
*  pick the following year. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6055.9s)]
*  An all-timer. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6057.299999999999s)]
*  It's an all-timer and it's really the original sin of this generation of the [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6058.5s)]
*  Giants that in the Daniel Jones contract extension, if they were to pass on a guy [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6061.7s)]
*  who legitimately not because they were the same number and not because they went to [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6067.82s)]
*  the same college is compared to Michael Parsons. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6070.5s)]
*  The way they used to met Penn State, the way he went into his coach's office, you [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6072.9s)]
*  know, that final year and he looked at James Franklin and said, I don't want to [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6078.74s)]
*  just be this, make me a guy who plays off the ball. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6081.58s)]
*  Let me do all these things. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6084.139999999999s)]
*  And then did it at a higher level than Parsons in college. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6085.26s)]
*  It would be an incredible, incredible mistake made twice, at least in my eyes. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6088.26s)]
*  I don't think you pass on him. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6093.86s)]
*  Even if you have all these different pass rushers already. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6094.94s)]
*  That said, there is the injury stuff. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6098.0199999999995s)]
*  Didn't compete at the combine, didn't do it with the pro day. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6100.26s)]
*  So if you want to make that a red flag, fine. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6102.26s)]
*  And then off the field, it's not like, you know, this guy is necessarily [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6103.9s)]
*  marrying your daughter. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6107.62s)]

*  None of that is this, but that's just the word around the street is that he's not the [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6110.26s)]

*  Okay. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6131.94s)]

*  Hey, what's up, Mike? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6135.98s)]
*  You know what you're doing at three yet? [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6136.98s)]
*  You know, we still don't know. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6138.9s)]
*  Um, the truth is I'll let you know when we do, but we're leaning towards Carter, but [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6140.9s)]
*  uh, the door is still open. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6144.86s)]
*  What do you got? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6146.0199999999995s)]
*  I have an idea. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6147.259999999999s)]
*  We can flip picks three to four. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6149.66s)]
*  I'll give you my second next year and I'll give you my fourth next year and [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6154.5s)]
*  you just move back one spot. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6160.219999999999s)]
*  That's my offer. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6162.259999999999s)]
*  And also I'm willing to talk about it a little bit. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6163.34s)]
*  Who am I taking it for? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6165.94s)]
*  If that's the case, am I, am I, what is your, what are you implying? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6168.0599999999995s)]
*  I just, if you like Sanders, why don't you take them at three, take them at [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6171.219999999999s)]
*  four and get some stuff back. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6175.46s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6177.94s)]
*  So this is, this is what the Niners and Bears did a few years ago. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6178.5s)]
*  I'm still playing Joe Shane, just giving a history lesson, uh, for Trubisky. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6181.62s)]
*  They said, okay, we'll move up one spot. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6184.9s)]
*  We'll move back. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6186.9s)]
*  We'll take Solomon Thomas, get a little extra. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6187.54s)]
*  I, you know, I, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6189.94s)]
*  a little extra for that. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6190.74s)]
*  I can't remember for Trubisky. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6191.66s)]
*  Wasn't that much, right? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6193.139999999999s)]
*  It was like a second. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6194.179999999999s)]
*  Wasn't that much. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6194.98s)]
*  I believe it was the second round pick and the Niners were doing flips. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6195.94s)]
*  What happens if you, Joe Shane comes back and says, I'll flip spots with you, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6198.62s)]
*  but I want your first next year and I'll give you my third. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6204.66s)]
*  Mike, what happens if we do this? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6207.74s)]
*  I will flip spots with you, but I need next year's first. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6209.7s)]
*  What would you say? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6212.0599999999995s)]
*  Give me a third back and it's, it's a done deal. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6215.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6218.26s)]
*  We've got to think the hundred fourth pick is that, so you're saying the, I [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6218.5s)]
*  give you the third and the hundred fourth and I get next year's first, next year's [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6222.18s)]
*  second and a fourth this year. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6227.62s)]
*  You want my fourth this year too? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6231.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6232.58s)]
*  I need another pick. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6233.0599999999995s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6234.22s)]
*  I got to hang up. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6237.86s)]
*  I got, I got to talk to craft. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6238.66s)]
*  I got to talk to crafted yelling him for not taking week 18. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6241.78s)]
*  And we just, I got to hang up and go scream at drew lock for throwing for 200 [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6244.94s)]
*  yards against the Colts in week 16. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6248.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6251.9s)]
*  See the paths need so many things. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6252.22s)]
*  They're probably better off just staying at four and taking Will Campbell. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6254.34s)]
*  But if they think Carter is Michael Parsons and the price would be flipping [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6257.900000000001s)]
*  picks with the giants, I think the paths are going to be good next year. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6264.54s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be winning the super bowl, but I think they [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6269.54s)]

*  What is the shocker? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6316.62s)]
*  The guy's name. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6318.34s)]
*  You just had to have one guess. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6318.94s)]
*  Guy's name is Gray Zable. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6320.22s)]
*  Has that name come across your board at all? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6322.099999999999s)]
*  Not that, that haven't done a lot of Gray Zable work. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6324.3s)]
*  What is that? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6326.98s)]
*  Offensive guard at a North Dakota state in the last 72 hours. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6327.78s)]
*  I've gotten multiple calls from teams looking at my mock draft. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6331.94s)]
*  Here's how I do it. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6334.5s)]
*  I've talked to people, I put together a mock draft and I send it to like all the [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6335.5s)]
*  teams and I'm like, what am I missing? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6338.5s)]
*  Who am I missing? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6339.5s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6340.5s)]
*  And a lot of teams will tell me we actually like this guy more than this guy. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6341.5s)]
*  So just put him there if you want, I'll throw you a favor, throw you a bone on that. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6344.5s)]
*  Or where's this player? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6347.5s)]
*  And unanimously I'm getting, where is Gray Zable in your top 20? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6349.5s)]
*  The first in the top 20. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6353.5s)]
*  Watch for Gray Zable at a North Dakota state to suddenly be one of these guys who [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6355.5s)]
*  goes like 15, 17, 18, 19, even if it's early 20s. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6359.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6364.5s)]
*  A player who had the senior ball played well and then you didn't hear from him again. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6365.5s)]
*  And he's an offensive guard, but he's looked at as like one of these wallers and [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6368.5s)]
*  in a draft full of just meh, he is one of these guys that they think the sky could [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6372.5s)]
*  be the limit. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6376.5s)]
*  So that is my wild card. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6377.5s)]
*  Put the pads on with him. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6378.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6379.5s)]
*  Then Vrabel might want to wrestle with them. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6380.5s)]
*  Put him in a headlock. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6382.5s)]
*  See what he's like. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6383.5s)]
*  So you have your mock draft coming on Wednesday. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6384.5s)]
*  Yep. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6386.5s)]
*  And this has been a mock draft that has been a very successful one. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6387.5s)]
*  So you send, you'll send like little, oh yeah. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6391.5s)]
*  You'll send spots to teams and do who's missing. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6394.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6397.5s)]
*  What's crazy. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6398.5s)]
*  What jumps out of you. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6399.5s)]
*  I'm looking at my phone already. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6400.5s)]
*  It's I sent to Howie Roseman this morning, Adam Peters this morning with Washington, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6401.5s)]
*  John Spy tech at the Raiders. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6406.5s)]
*  And some of them won't respond or someone will say, we actually like Memboo more than [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6408.5s)]
*  this guy or they'll say, Hey, we're going to send you a little, a little, a little [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6412.5s)]
*  Why do you have, why do you have McKell? [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6417.5s)]
*  Why do you have Will Johnson from Michigan going in the mid twenties as opposed to like [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6419.5s)]
*  top 15? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6423.5s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6424.5s)]
*  And then in exchange it's, Hey, you're missing Gray Zable or what about the Oregon tackle? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6425.5s)]
*  He's not in your first room. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6430.5s)]
*  Gray Zable almost seems like a fake name. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6431.5s)]
*  Gray Zable. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6433.5s)]

*  He takes plays off. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6557.94s)]
*  His motor isn't always going. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6558.94s)]
*  And in this past season, it was a significant difference in his consistency than the year [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6559.94s)]
*  before. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6560.94s)]
*  Now, the year before, Arizona was coached by Jed Fish. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6561.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6562.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6563.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6564.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6565.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6566.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6567.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6568.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6569.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6570.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6571.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6572.94s)]
*  They had an offense that was humming. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6574.419999999999s)]
*  They were a top 10 team at one point and this guy was engaged. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6576.5599999999995s)]
*  Last year they took a dip. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6580.58s)]
*  They had a new coaching staff. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6581.58s)]
*  It wasn't as good. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6583.419999999999s)]
*  That said, six foot four, fast, dominant hands and like teams that met with him. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6585.259999999999s)]
*  Physical. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6592.9s)]
*  He's a different cat. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6593.9s)]
*  Now he's from Hawaii and he comes in and something that brought people wrong was like, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6594.9s)]
*  I'm a volleyball player first, football player second, something of that. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6599.299999999999s)]
*  I love volleyball. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6603.1s)]
*  Now football guys see that and they like bang their head through glass and they're like, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6604.780000000001s)]
*  a coach who's more evolved says, all right, he's got volleyball skills and we will coach [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6610.620000000001s)]
*  him up and we will get the most out of him. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6615.740000000001s)]
*  Now the ceiling is Mike Evans. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6617.700000000001s)]
*  The basement or the floor could be- [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6621.620000000001s)]
*  The ceiling is Mike Evans who said one of the best wide receiver careers start to finish [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6623.660000000001s)]
*  in the last 30 years. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6628.080000000001s)]
*  Good ceiling. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6629.780000000001s)]
*  Same body type and a better college career than Mike Evans had. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6631.0199999999995s)]
*  So you're looking at that. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6633.94s)]
*  And in a wide receiver draft that is putrid. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6636.0599999999995s)]
*  Putrid. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6639.78s)]
*  I mean, last year we had neighbors, Adunze, Harrison. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6640.78s)]
*  That's why I'm scared about him because this is what happens with the draft. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6644.78s)]
*  When you're in this cluster and you're way better than everyone else in the cluster, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6649.46s)]
*  but it's a bad cluster. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6652.38s)]
*  This is the same thing with the quarterbacks. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6654.139999999999s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6656.0599999999995s)]
*  Jackson Dart wouldn't have gotten drafted in the first 45 picks last year. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6657.0599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6660.74s)]
*  Not of... [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6661.74s)]
*  But McMillan, what I like though is that the evolved coaches who I've spoken to, they didn't [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6662.74s)]
*  just shut it down. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6668.34s)]
*  It's not that he doesn't love football. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6669.34s)]
*  It's that this kid is different and he's got other interests, but gosh, when he's on the [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6670.74s)]
*  football field, he turns it on. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6674.26s)]
*  So I don't know if it could be your first pick as a GM or your first pick as a head [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6675.58s)]
*  coach, but if you're secure in your spot and you're looking at this draft and it's a bunch [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6681.5s)]
*  This guy is the sky's the limit prospect as far as skill position goes. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6686.78s)]
*  It feels very Dallas Cowboys-y at number 12 to me. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6692.42s)]
*  Got the same type of body type as C.D. Lamb though. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6696.0199999999995s)]
*  No, I'm just saying like, ah, now look at him, a Dak and these two. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6699.179999999999s)]
*  This is the Eagles blueprint. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6703.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6704.94s)]
*  I have him going currently 19 to Tampa, which is crazy because a week ago I had him going [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6705.94s)]
*  either four or five. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6712.0599999999995s)]
*  I think he goes in the teens. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6713.0599999999995s)]
*  So I want to talk about the Niners at 11. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6715.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6718.18s)]
*  Sal and I did guest aligns over unders for the first time ever this year and I heard [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6719.18s)]
*  four and a half. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6723.900000000001s)]
*  I was four wins off on the Niners. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6725.02s)]
*  I thought it was going to be six and a half. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6726.820000000001s)]
*  It was 10 and a half. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6728.1s)]
*  It's still 10 and a half on Fandel, even though there's a bunch of action. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6729.38s)]
*  There's minus 130 under and there's reasons for it. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6732.5s)]
*  The schedule, the divisions they play, uh, they have fourth place schedule, all that [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6735.46s)]
*  stuff. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6739.3s)]
*  And yet I'm looking at the Niners at 11. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6740.46s)]
*  Do they think they're good? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6744.02s)]
*  If they do think they're good, are they going to get aggressive? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6747.62s)]
*  Are they going to try to move up? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6750.54s)]
*  Um, will they try to move back? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6752.42s)]
*  They feel like a pivot team to me. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6754.900000000001s)]
*  The Bears are staying at 10 and they're going to take a weapon. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6756.38s)]
*  I think. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6758.62s)]
*  I think the Bears are interesting because they lead to the Niners. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6759.62s)]
*  The Bears at 10, like if Colston Loveland is sitting there, the tight end, a riser, [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6763.9400000000005s)]
*  that's really interesting for the Bears. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6769.7s)]
*  You add another weapon to them. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6771.58s)]
*  I could see the Bears take an offensive line, going, going with the big kid out of, uh, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6773.58s)]
*  out of the Alabama Booker or the, or Kelvin. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6779.62s)]
*  Um, I'm losing his name, Texas, the offensive towel. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6783.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6786.3s)]
*  The Niners, their defense was atrocious last year and that's been the long, they just lost [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6787.3s)]
*  a bunch of dudes. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6794.62s)]
*  They did. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6795.86s)]
*  They've long been their pride of their team up front. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6796.86s)]
*  So you know, you look at the big kid, McHale Williams out of, out of Georgia, that's a [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6800.86s)]
*  possibility there. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6805.66s)]
*  Or you look at defensive back and there's, you know, Hunter, but then this kid Baron [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6807.099999999999s)]
*  out of Texas who won all the awards is a superb talent too. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6811.179999999999s)]
*  And is it like, to your point, the economics of it, if we get a number one corner and he's [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6815.74s)]
*  sitting there at 11, like we could put that pick in and we're good and we're building. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6820.0599999999995s)]
*  Or are you trying to swing the bat and try to do something major and move up and get [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6824.3s)]
*  one of these star players and try to stay in the conversation for the other? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6827.9400000000005s)]
*  Try to get all the way up to three for Carter. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6830.7s)]
*  See I, I think Mason Graham is the guy who could potentially fall five, six spots. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6832.9800000000005s)]
*  The, the, you know, awesome middle of the line guy. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6838.66s)]
*  There was a moment where I would have been psyched if the Pats took them, but then they [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6842.38s)]
*  signed Williams. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6845.06s)]
*  So it makes sense. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6846.06s)]
*  He's a three tech, he's a three technique player. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6847.06s)]
*  He's got an incredible motor. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6848.9800000000005s)]
*  Everyone likes him, but his body type is not, you're not going to sit in a room with [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6850.5s)]
*  Mason Graham and think he's Aaron Donald. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6854.1s)]
*  So there's questions like what's the, what's the sky's the limit with this guy? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6855.9400000000005s)]
*  Or have we seen the best of them? [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6858.860000000001s)]
*  Also it's a pretty deep position. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6860.5s)]
*  Can I give you a good, I can give you a good Sala note. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6862.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6865.02s)]
*  Oh, Sala. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6866.02s)]
*  Sala is the new defensive coordinator of the Niners. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6867.02s)]
*  I have to share this with you. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6869.620000000001s)]
*  I don't think anyone's reported this and I don't think you and Sala discussed it. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6870.9800000000005s)]
*  Sala and his wife had another kid this off season. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6874.46s)]
*  So it's a eight? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6882.34s)]
*  Eight. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6883.54s)]
*  This is like, how does he not have a reality show? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6884.54s)]
*  And his wife is the best. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6887.62s)]
*  Eight kids. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6890.82s)]
*  This is it. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6891.82s)]
*  Eight kids quietly in the off season. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6892.82s)]
*  Sala, another kid. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6896.22s)]
*  God bless him. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6898.22s)]
*  I love that man. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6899.5s)]
*  His new child, Aaron Rogers Sala. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6900.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6902.860000000001s)]
*  The Niners to me, major wild card. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6903.860000000001s)]
*  Miami, a team that kind of needs everything and is being held hostage by whatever the [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6907.5s)]
*  hell is going on with Tyra Kill. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6913.78s)]
*  Another question for you. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6916.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6917.06s)]
*  Do the Rams just draft the QB or is that weird? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6918.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6922.1s)]
*  Because they think they can win the Super Bowl. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6923.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6924.1s)]
*  They're drafting somebody that can help them, right? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6925.1s)]
*  Or trade back. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6926.74s)]
*  Classic let's need trade back. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6928.74s)]
*  Let's just collect a lot. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6931.66s)]
*  Because we hear about the teams that second round is like, we'll trade up and get our [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6932.66s)]
*  quarterback. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6934.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6935.98s)]
*  If there's a player that can help them out. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6937.459999999999s)]
*  I mean, last year I came on your podcast and like, there's no way McVeigh of this first, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6939.419999999999s)]
*  first round pick isn't taking offense. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6943.74s)]
*  And then he took Jared verse and I looked like an idiot. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6945.099999999999s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is they wanted Brock. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6948.339999999999s)]
*  They wanted Brock Bowers and they were looking to get trade up. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6950.339999999999s)]
*  If a Loveland was to drop to them, if a Buco was to drop to them, I think they would consider [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6953.82s)]
*  it. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6958.86s)]
*  But like, I don't think the Rams are looking to stay put at 26 unless there's a player [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6959.86s)]
*  that falls precipitously to them. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6964.339999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6967.1s)]
*  Here's my big prediction. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6968.1s)]
*  It's not even a crazy prediction because I think it's in the ether. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6969.1s)]
*  By the way, Bill, I would say Seattle is a more likely in the NFC West quarterback team [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6972.86s)]
*  to trade back into the first round or early second than the Rams. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6979.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6983.86s)]
*  I think Cousins ends up on the Steelers. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6985.98s)]
*  Go on. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6988.74s)]
*  It's been floated out there. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6990.26s)]
*  There's been scenarios. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6992.74s)]
*  There's a couple of things that don't add up. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6994.86s)]
*  And you read some of the intel from people like Schefter where the Falcons are like, [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=6997.259999999999s)]
*  yeah, we trade them, but you got to pay some of a salary. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7001.9s)]
*  And teams are like, well, we'll pay 10. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7004.94s)]
*  It's like, no, it's got to be 20. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7006.74s)]
*  The Falcons have no leverage at all. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7009.139999999999s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7011.98s)]
*  They're going to pay Kirk Cousins a gazillion dollars to be their backup. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7012.98s)]
*  They have to trade him. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7017.42s)]
*  They have to trade him this week and they have to trade him to a team that is going [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7019.099999999999s)]
*  to start to freak out that they're on the quarterback yet, which is basically the Pittsburgh [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7022.82s)]
*  Steelers. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7026.34s)]
*  So if the Steelers can be like, fine, we'll pay 11 million or 12 million, whatever, like [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7027.82s)]
*  the Falcons, this is a sunk cost. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7033.139999999999s)]
*  Any money they can get back to dump his contract, they've got to do it. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7036.38s)]
*  You can't keep him. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7041.38s)]
*  Like they probably feel like they're going to be pretty good. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7043.099999999999s)]
*  They're in a crappy division. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7044.86s)]
*  Like who knows? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7046.139999999999s)]
*  So I just think he ends up on the Steelers and I don't think the Sanders thing is as [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7047.66s)]
*  important for them. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7051.42s)]
*  Everybody has them taking Sanders. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7052.82s)]
*  If I feel like they could pass on him at 21, maybe get him in the second round and still [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7055.66s)]
*  get Cousins. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7061.42s)]
*  I, by the way, think Cousins is washed and I think it's a mistake. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7062.78s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7066.22s)]
*  I mean, he played hard at the end there, but if you watched that Monday night game Raiders [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7066.9400000000005s)]
*  versus Falcons when Kirk Cousins could not throw a football, his shoulder was messed [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7072.14s)]
*  up. We learned about it afterwards, but like he probably was on the field for two extra [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7076.42s)]
*  weeks that Atlanta should have had him on. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7080.46s)]
*  They lost those games and it cost them in the end. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7082.42s)]
*  I thought Cleveland and then they signed Joe Flacco. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7085.9800000000005s)]
*  So cross Cleveland off. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7088.22s)]
*  I thought the Giants were a fuss. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7089.74s)]
*  You'd rather pay Joe Flacco four million than Kirk Cousins ten or pay ten for Kirk Cousins. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7091.22s)]
*  Who's been there. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7097.1s)]
*  And I know the connection there was the Fansky and Cousins have a great relationship, but [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7097.9s)]
*  that's such a big price tag. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7101.66s)]
*  And then you're kind of setting yourself back as a franchise with Flacco. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7103.18s)]
*  You get the one year and you see, and then you go from there. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7106.54s)]
*  I haven't done the work on Pittsburgh. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7110.86s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7112.78s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the different connections. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7113.66s)]
*  Have Arthur Smith worked with Cousins? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7115.34s)]
*  No, they didn't overlap in Atlanta. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7116.94s)]
*  To me, it's such a shocker to me that they put themselves in this corner with Rogers [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7120.46s)]
*  of all the franchises with the place that they're at. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7125.34s)]
*  They look more done than Cousins. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7127.58s)]
*  But also just with the veterans in the locker room, like Kim Hayward and T.J. Watt and Minka [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7129.66s)]
*  Fitzpatrick and guys that are like known made men and were sitting around waiting for [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7134.78s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7140.62s)]
*  It's a shock. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7141.98s)]
*  And I got to think that if they were to do this all over again, they didn't put up much [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7142.62s)]
*  of a fight to bring back Justin Fields. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7147.099999999999s)]
*  The Jets got him for two years, 20 million apiece, whatever. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7149.179999999999s)]
*  And then they did not put up any fight to get Russell Wilson back. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7152.78s)]
*  Cousins would be one of those deals where like, gosh, this all went awry. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7157.5s)]
*  I guess we'll get Cousins with like a shrug. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7163.820000000001s)]
*  But you're getting like a better locker room fit than Rodgers. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7166.3s)]
*  You're getting a guy that everybody loves being a teammate of. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7172.38s)]
*  No doubt. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7175.820000000001s)]
*  But can he still play? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7176.860000000001s)]
*  And the price tag is going to be big. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7178.54s)]
*  I mean, I think Atlanta is going to pick up most of it. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7181.02s)]
*  But can we agree it's kind of dumbfounding that they've had no solution and it's past [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7183.26s)]
*  mid-April now? [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7189.5s)]
*  They have no quarterbacks. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7190.9400000000005s)]
*  I'll tell you this from the Giants side. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7192.860000000001s)]
*  To Rodgers' credit, and you can say, screw that, he looked at these teams and said, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7194.860000000001s)]
*  guys, I'm on my own timeline. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7200.14s)]
*  If you need to pivot and make a move, there is no hard feelings. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7202.62s)]
*  I am telling you straight up. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7205.34s)]
*  I do not know when and if I'm coming back. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7206.78s)]
*  And that is on you to do it. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7209.42s)]
*  And Giants heard that. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7211.02s)]
*  Giants waited a couple of weeks and they were like, all right, we got to act. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7213.26s)]
*  And they did it. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7216.06s)]
*  And they got Russell Wilson and Jameis. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7216.7s)]
*  Steelers were like, all right. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7219.02s)]
*  And they still haven't made a move. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7221.820000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7225.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7227.900000000001s)]
*  I think we hit everything. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7229.42s)]
*  Except Kyle Brant, some hurtful comments on the last rewatchables. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgAUlrB-ok&t=7231.580000000001s)]
