# Would the Lakers Consider Trading Anthony Davis? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld_Cu6hXw5k)
*  Are we sure Anthony Davis wouldn't be one of the moves if LeBron knows he's going to
*  be here this year next?
*  How close is the AD LeBron combination?
*  Do you feel like that's like Tubbs and Crockett?
*  That that's Batman and Robin?
*  That those guys are just tied?
*  Or if they got a really good offer for Davis that allowed them to rebuild a little bit,
*  some stuff, open things up and maybe potentially make themselves a better team for somebody
*  who's had just an incredible amount of trouble staying on the court that they wouldn't think
*  about that.
*  So here's the thing we had.
*  We've just been talking about how much talent there is.
*  We're going to get to midseason and there's going to be, you know, we're going to have
*  a game of musical chairs.
*  Yes.
*  We're going to have teams that are like, wait a minute.
*  We're near the tax or maybe we're looking at being in the tax and my stars, they're
*  older and look at these studs because this draft class is exciting and we're in 12th
*  place or we're in 9th place.
*  And even if we do great, we're not even getting out of the play in.
*  And so the league is top heavy right now.
*  That's why I like make fun of the thunder all you want.
*  Like the thunder are doing exactly what they should be doing because they can't compete
*  in that level.
*  And like this is like the jazz.
*  Like I keep laughing out loud every time Danny Ainge or Justin Zanuck, two people I respect
*  are acting like, oh, we're not tanking.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  I mean, we were going to still try to compete.
*  No, you should be losing as much as you possibly can.
*  Every win should be disappointing.
*  And Danny used to agonize when Brad Stevens would pull these wins out during his two year
*  tanking session. That was never happened because Brad Stevens was too good.
*  He f***ed it off.
*  I've been a little connected to the jazz for the last few months.
*  Yeah.
*  Like almost nothing that the jazz has said publicly for four or five months has actually
*  been true.
*  We're not going to trade.
*  Go bear.
*  No, we're going to build around Donovan.
*  The Mitchell thing was the best.
*  Yeah. No, no.
*  Mitchell's here.
*  It's like, no, he's not.
*  We're going to build around here.
*  We don't have to trade Bogdanovich before camp.
*  That's not important.
*  Like I just saw it at media day.
*  They're like, you know, we've got good veterans.
*  You know, we're going to try to win these.
*  Like, don't judge their words.
*  Judge their actions.
*  But so my point is like, if we get to, what if we get to January and the Lakers are sitting
*  there in 10th or 11th place?
*  Well, what if, yeah, what if LeBron misses 20 games with a pulled hamstring and the Lakers
*  are 20 and 35?
*  Like, here's the thing.
*  Like, what if this Westbrook situation isn't actually a disaster?
*  What if Westbrook actually accepts a lesser role?
*  Yeah.
*  Hits some corner threes and like they don't have to send them home.
*  Like, they're in the quarter threes.
*  But go ahead.
*  Okay.
*  Let's just say that like it doesn't go terribly.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're still in like 11th place.
*  Like that's like, that's possible.
*  Like this is what I'm saying.
*  Well, how about this?
*  Who do you like more than them or less than them out of Golden State, Clippers,
*  Memphis, Phoenix, Denver, Dallas, Minnesota, New Orleans?
*  I don't think they have a better roster than any of those eight teams.
*  I don't.
*  Just think of, they finished 11th last year.
*  Okay.
*  Now think of the teams that finished in front of them.
*  Who do we know for sure they're passing?
*  Okay.
*  We know for sure they're passing Utah.
*  Utah is coming backwards.
*  But, but on the flip side, you have, yeah, you have New Orleans jumping up.
*  Although I guess New Orleans was ahead of them already.
*  You, you could argue Sacramento improved more than they did.
*  I'm just looking at, like, I thought the Schroeder thing was hilarious.
*  Cause Schroeder last year, the Celtics tried to trade for three weeks before
*  the deadline, as you know, they're trying to give away to everybody.
*  And then at the last second, the Rockets were like, Hey, we kind of want to get
*  off this tights contract.
*  We'll take Schroeder if, you know, if you, and the Souths were great.
*  And they dumped Schroeder, right?
*  No playoff team wanted him.
*  And then the Lakers get him three weeks ago and everybody's like, Schroeder,
*  great deal savvy minimum.
*  And it's like, what are you guys talking about?
*  No playoff team wanted him six months ago.
*  This was not savvy.
*  Lonnie Walker was the worst mid-level exception guy anyone signed in this whole
*  league, they did not make themselves better.
*  Is it really the way they're going to get better?
*  If Davis is good.
*  They don't have any shooting.
*  That's this is what, you know,
*  Or perimeter defense.
*  They're missing the two things that helped them win the title three years ago.
*  And they still didn't address it.
*  I know that's another topic conversation.
*  The point that you're making about Dan Davis is, is like, what if, like, it's
*  one thing that the Lakers are a disaster, but what if they're not a disaster, but
*  they're still not good enough, which I think I just don't think they're good enough.
*  I mean, as good as Lebron and ADR, they could have good seasons.
*  Lonnie Walker could be like better than we think.
*  Russell Westbrook could not have to be sent home in November and they
*  could still be in 10th place.
*  Like this is what I keep saying.
*  Like I was in Cleveland two weeks ago when Donovan Mitchell arrived.
*  I was talking to the Cavs folks.
*  I was like, guys, this team could be awesome and you could finish sixth.
*  Because that's the nature of it.
*  So like somebody at mid season, maybe two teams, and I'm looking at the Chicago
*  Bulls and Lonzo Ball gave an interview today, Tuesday.
*  That was an extraordinarily depressing interview about the state of his knee.
*  Yeah.
*  It sounds brutal.
*  That he can't go upstairs without pain that he can't run.
*  Like they don't, that the doctors have to go in there and see what's wrong.
*  Like if you're a bulls fan, like you've got to be vomiting in the trash can
*  hearing that, and you're looking at the East, you're looking at Atlanta trading
*  for all stars and the Cavs trading for all stars, those are teams that were
*  behind you that just went past you.
*  So like what happens to the Bulls at mid season?
*  What happens to the Lakers maybe at mid season?
*  So like, I'm not, I'm, I'm going to write that down in my imaginary notebook.
*  Yeah.
*  Which you just brought up now.
*  The Lakers.
*  Thanks for not mentioning the Celtics.
*  Thanks for not mentioning the Celtics and the what happens to them.
*  But why would the Celtics be that way?
*  I think the Celtics are awesome.
*  Okay.
*  Great.
*  I, I, you know, it's been not an easy week.
*  I agree.
*  And maybe they won't be as good as they were last year, but they're like,
*  no, they'll still be good.
*  Yeah.
*  They'll still be defensively, but yeah, it hasn't been an awesome off season.
*  Well, it was a good off season.
*  Like Tim Bontemps from our staff.
*  Right.
*  Like three weeks ago, Tim Bontemps from our staff, like he surveyed like a
*  couple dozen NBA executives.
*  They said, who had the best off season?
*  Celtics finished first.
*  First three weeks ago.
*  The NBA moves fast.
*  The Knicks are another team that I feel like could Godfather offer Davis.
*  And I do feel like that was a piece of not ultimately going too far with Mitchell
*  because I just feel like the way I said this before, but the way the league works
*  now, there's going to be another Mitchell.
*  There's going to be, you're just sitting in that bar stool waiting for the
*  opposite sex to come in.
*  And if you didn't click with the one, well, guess what?
*  Two hours later, somebody else is going to be sitting in the stool next to you.
*  And you just got to be ready.
*  That's right.
*  And here's the other thing though.
*  I think right now the Lakers think that they're going to take advantage of that.
*  They think we're going to get to December or January and we're going to have this
*  Westbrook contract and we're going to have the draft picks.
*  Yeah.
*  And like, maybe that's what will happen.
*  So like the Bulls are like, Oh my God, we were a fringe playoff team.
*  What are we doing?
*  Maybe we just cash in our DeRozan and some other stuff and we'll take that Westbrook.
*  We'll grab some picks.
*  We can use those picks to trade this summer and we'll
*  I mean, ultimately Westbrook is in a very valuable expiring contract.
*  It's, it's a huge number.
*  You don't come across those types of expiring contracts.
*  And so I'm just like right today in September, I'm looking at the Bulls after
*  seeing this Lonzo interview going, boy, I don't know what's going to happen with them.
*  But it, but three weeks from now could be another team.
