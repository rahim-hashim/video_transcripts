# Could UConn Guys Go No. 1 and No. 2 in the NBA Draft? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A)
*  Being in Massachusetts with access to Fandl where you could just be like, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=0.0s)]
*  ah, screw it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=4.0s)]
*  I'll bet on the NBA draft. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=4.7s)]
*  I was looking at the odds and I've kind of settled on a hot draft take opinion. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=5.94s)]
*  Priscilla, would you be shocked if Klingon was just the number one pick? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=11.3s)]
*  Not even close to being shocked. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=16.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=18.34s)]
*  So he's, as we're taping this, he's 15 to one on Fandl to be the number one pick. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=18.64s)]
*  And I've talked to some NBA people the last couple of weeks, and especially in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=23.68s)]
*  person this week, and it feels like he's the only one in this top five that people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=26.58s)]
*  were like, I at least know what that guy is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=32.48s)]
*  And I wonder if that just trumps all the other stuff in this draft. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=35.16s)]
*  Cause like we talked a couple of weeks ago about the way to think of this draft [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=39.04s)]
*  is just to slice off, pretend there's a top seven that already got drafted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  And now we're starting at number eight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  And when in a normal draft where you slice the top seven off and you get to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=48.14s)]
*  number eight, teams start drafting a little more toward need than they do for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=51.62s)]
*  best player available. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=56.5s)]
*  The point is that I'm not sure there is a best player available and Klingon is [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=57.459999999999994s)]
*  just shop locker. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  He's been really successful. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=62.72s)]
*  He won a state title in high school. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  He's won two in Yukon, although the first time he was a bench guy, but, and you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=65.72s)]
*  kind of know what he is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=69.94s)]
*  So, so you don't think it's crazy either. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  No, I'd say in the conversations that I've had about the draft, which are still [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=73.62s)]
*  somewhat limited, but it's, it's a more fun draft to talk about with teams only [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=79.14s)]
*  because they'll be like, why do you guys all think this? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=82.98s)]
*  And that happens every year, but not like this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=86.42s)]
*  And I try to remind everybody like, Hey, I'm not in charge of everything. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=90.5s)]
*  So, and I don't even have a lot of draft up, but that's your point is that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=93.22s)]
*  There's a lot of teams that get, they don't have to be tasked with the actual [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=99.5s)]
*  decision of who to take one or who to take two, but it feels like there's growing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=104.22s)]
*  momentum of a lot of teams being like, man, the buzz is that these mocks are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=107.92s)]
*  just assuming SAR reshasha in this way that it's not even close to their boards. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=111.4s)]
*  And I guess this was starting to happen at the combine a little. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=120.0s)]
*  Now, again, I know the counter to this is always a really simple one. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=122.58s)]
*  It was like, well, it's easy to do that when you know, you don't have to worry [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=125.04s)]
*  about the pick and then when you have the pick, it's a little bit different, but it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=126.88s)]
*  gets back to the great Neil O'Shea line where he was like, if there were no mocks, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=129.64s)]
*  the drafts would actually play out much differently, but it becomes consensus. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=132.84s)]
*  You decide to go outside the box and then if you're wrong outside the box, your [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=136.68s)]
*  owner's like, what are you doing? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=139.56s)]
*  Why did you take that guy two years later? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=141.24s)]
*  So you're absolutely right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=142.92s)]
*  Like based on what you're saying with this, I feel like the draft is the most exciting [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=144.52s)]
*  thing because not because of the talent, but because of like a lot of just underlying, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=149.16s)]
*  like, Hey, you guys are assuming way too much in the media. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=154.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=158.0s)]
*  So I look at like Phillies at number 16 and normally it'd be like number 16. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=158.48s)]
*  And maybe in this draft, number 16 might actually, you end up by getting a top five [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=163.2s)]
*  guy because there's going to be so many misses, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=169.0s)]
*  There's going to be so like the number seven pick might just be a complete bus. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  The number 10 pick might be a complete bus. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=175.88s)]
*  But the way I was thinking about the draft was those NFL drafts where you kind of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  know a quarterback is going to go third, but the team that's picking third, it [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=184.12s)]
*  doesn't make sense for them to pick, but you kind of know just looking at it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=188.48s)]
*  Well, somebody's going to trade up then and take them because somebody's going to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=192.6s)]
*  want him and I feel that way about Klingon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=196.2s)]
*  It's the more I watch him and the more I read about the draft and it's just like, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  you know what he is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=203.88s)]
*  If you're a team like OKC and you could just move up from 12 to one with assets [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=204.92s)]
*  and just be like, all right, we get this guy, this is kind of what we need and we'll [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  overpay for it a little bit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  Or, you know, Houston could move up from three to one, but he just seems like the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=214.6s)]
*  sure that I look at SAR like started and even average 10 points a game in New [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  Zealand. You know, the French swing man, who knows that guy was like in an [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=223.16s)]
*  offensive funk for most of the year until the last month. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=227.16s)]
*  So a lot of this stuff doesn't pass the sniff test to me like Shepard, really good [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=230.6s)]
*  college shooter for one year. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  It's a 30 game sample size, but he's six, one and a half. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  And we hit the playoffs every year where those guys just get routinely hunted. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=239.6s)]
*  I find it hard to believe he's going to be the number one pick. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=243.6s)]
*  You just start crossing guys off and then it's like, all right, could Klingon be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=245.52s)]
*  go bearish? Like maybe. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=249.84s)]
*  Right. Possibly sort of. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=254.56s)]
*  Yeah, the room protection in college is unbelievable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=258.16s)]
*  And you would just love to see some shooting from him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=260.4s)]
*  But he took nine threes his entire career. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=265.72s)]
*  So then you go, OK, well, can he develop that? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=268.92s)]
*  But the free throw percentage is at 56 percent for his career. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=271.12s)]
*  So usually that's something with someone where you're like, hey, the three year, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=275.08s)]
*  the overall field goal percentage outside of the pain is in that great. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=278.52s)]
*  But the free throw shooting percentage is something teams constantly talk about that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  And with Klingon, I think it's just a simple like, OK, well, at least, you know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=285.08s)]
*  to your point, he can move around on defense. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=288.56s)]
*  He was unbelievable to rim in college. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it was it was hilarious watching Illinois be like, I think we're going to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  get this guy in foul trouble. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=297.52s)]
*  And you're like, you guys need another plan. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  Like, he's destroying you at the rim every single time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think OKC is interesting one because they could just pay it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if Presti would be like, well, I know I can probably do whatever I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  want to do with any transaction, but do I just overpay because I have a surplus of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  picks? Well, if they evaluate him that way, like, what's the point? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=314.64s)]
*  What's the point of like, oh, we got rid of a 26 first. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  And I felt like this is a bit of an overpay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=320.96s)]
*  Memphis has been mentioned a lot with Klingon, too. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  But I like that one, too. Memphis is at nine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=326.4s)]
*  And the other thing is these teams can trade up in stages, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=328.76s)]
*  Like they like Atlanta could say to them, we don't want to fall below four or we [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=331.6s)]
*  don't want to fall below five. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=335.56s)]
*  And OKC Memphis would be like, cool, because Detroit is at five. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=337.52s)]
*  They don't know what to do. They don't want to take another young guy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=340.64s)]
*  So maybe we've tried to flip spots with them, get to five, and then we can give [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=343.2s)]
*  you five plus more stuff. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=347.24s)]
*  But the thing with Klingon, I was even thinking about it going to the finals game. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=349.64s)]
*  On on Thursday, where it's just, you know, it's really good sometimes having [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=354.56s)]
*  a tall guy who confronts some shots. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=359.84s)]
*  And if we're at the point in this draft where I'm not positive, what everybody's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  super elite skill is and he is the best tracker to read. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=366.44s)]
*  I mean, him going against Edie in the in the in the NCAA tournament [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=369.79999999999995s)]
*  and doing really well against him, I think was important. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=374.96s)]
*  You know, I also think he now granted, I'm not Mr. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  College Basketball, but I did watch a lot of stuff because I was bored on a plane. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=380.84s)]
*  He does have good hands. He's not clumsy, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=384.76s)]
*  No. Yeah, he can catch a lot of this stuff. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=387.28s)]
*  And he knows where to go. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, he knows how to put his hands up. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  And maybe that's enough. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=392.76s)]
*  And maybe for this draft, it's kind of like having the game manager [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  quarterback where you're like, I manage is a game. Cool. OK. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=397.23999999999995s)]
*  It's tough for the other two guys, too, because like when you watch Sarr, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  granted, he played his overall numbers aren't great because he played [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=405.4s)]
*  17 minutes a game for Perth and he just wasn't taking a ton of shots. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  But when you watch him run, you go, oh, my God, like, look at this guy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=414.32s)]
*  Like, they don't make a lot of guys. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=419.44s)]
*  There's not a lot of human beings that are running around like this, do you? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  On top of the three point shooting percentages weren't great, but he was taking him. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  It was it was something, at least with him, where he sees himself 19 years old [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=427.04s)]
*  now, like developing it out. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=431.0s)]
*  And whenever you're watching him or even research, who you're like, man, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  this guy can really like some of the catch and shoot stuff is really good. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=437.12s)]
*  And look how big he is and look how he runs the floor, even though [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  I think he plays a little bit smaller than he is. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=442.84s)]
*  And so when you're watching him as like prospects, you go, oh, wow. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=445.32s)]
*  Like, I could see Sarr, but you're constantly thinking about him [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=448.96s)]
*  as like the eighth or ninth pick. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=451.64s)]
*  Yeah. And that's why it kind of sucks for both guys, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  because when you're watching his potential first, you're going like Zach, just [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=457.12s)]
*  he's a really smart player. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=461.76s)]
*  There's some really cool small stuff that he does, the way he's screening off [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=462.79999999999995s)]
*  the ball and the way he comes back around to it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=466.12s)]
*  But I was like, he's not really like if you're going to be the number one pick [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=468.0s)]
*  and you're going to be this good and I'm looking at you as a scorer [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=470.8s)]
*  beyond just the shooting, it's like I'd love to see you create a little bit more [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  off the dribble. And you're like, that is not basically, you know, I'm still [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=475.76s)]
*  pretty limited in what I watch, but you just don't see a lot of it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  And then you're right. Like, sorry, you get lost. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  Like you throw in one of the games, you're like, oh, I have to wait for him [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=484.6s)]
*  to come off the bench and one of these. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=486.52000000000004s)]
*  So well, the other thing was, are they do the he the best thing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=488.64s)]
*  and the worst thing about him is he feels like he's a guard trapped [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=493.2s)]
*  in a big man's body. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=495.92s)]
*  Whenever I hear that, I'm like, you know what? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  That's not I don't consider that a positive. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=499.64s)]
*  I don't really want a guard trapped in a big man's body. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  I'd rather just have a big man and know he's a big man. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=505.0s)]
*  But that's what's funny about talking about drafts like this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=507.4s)]
*  And this is why I'm being really careful about this is just like blink test. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  Me reading this stuff, watching highlights and just having this 50 year [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  experience of what works and doesn't work in the draft. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=518.4s)]
*  And I just think when you get closer to the draft, teams get more and more [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=521.84s)]
*  comfortable with I actually I actually know what that is. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=524.92s)]
*  And that's what they take over like, man, I hope this is it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=528.48s)]
*  We've seen the most mistakes happen when people keep their fingers [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=531.52s)]
*  crossed and go, oh, Darko, you should have seen this workout he had. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=535.2800000000001s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=540.0s)]
*  And it's just all like hypothetical when you're just drafting on hypothetical [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=541.48s)]
*  on the top three or four gets super dicey, even Edwards. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  And that was such a weird year because there was no tournament [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  and it was a covid year. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=552.96s)]
*  Nobody got to work them out. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=554.08s)]
*  But he was still, you know, one of the biggest high school prospects. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=555.48s)]
*  He still had a good, good college year. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=559.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  That there was at least some things to point to this SAR like. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=563.56s)]
*  I just don't know how you evaluate that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=568.76s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=570.68s)]
*  It's and it's there's job protection pieces to it, too, where it's like, if [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=571.68s)]
*  you're wrong. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=576.04s)]
*  Now your owners just fucking side eyeing you like we took the SAR guy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=577.72s)]
*  He can't even he's in the G League. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=581.88s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=583.88s)]
*  Thanks for that one. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=584.96s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=586.68s)]
*  I think this stuff factors in. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=587.56s)]
*  If you're a good GM, you're golfing with your owner all the time. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=589.84s)]
*  You know, you're just in that first tee box and you're just going, man, this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=593.0s)]
*  draft is weird. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=595.72s)]
*  It's the weirdest. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=597.0s)]
*  You're just working him. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=598.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=599.72s)]
*  You're like, I just hope we get a player. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=600.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even it's 50 50. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=602.68s)]
*  The guy will even be in a rotation for us. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=604.4s)]
*  But think about the instinct of like survival. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=607.12s)]
*  And just to be fair, like SAR coming off the bench, there's plenty of international [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=609.0s)]
*  guys back in the day, too. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=611.92s)]
*  And it would always be funny because the Scouts would go to watch some [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=613.24s)]
*  international guy. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=616.44s)]
*  And then sometimes the coaches would get really weird about the attention. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  It's almost like a Caitlin Clark thing where they'd be like this guy who's like [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  the eighth best player in our team. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=623.84s)]
*  But you guys are going to draft him in the lottery because he's 610 and he's 18 [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  years old. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=627.88s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to play him in the second half now. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=628.44s)]
*  And there were a lot of guys that you looked at when you were getting ready for [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=630.96s)]
*  the draft. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=634.6s)]
*  You're like, that's weird. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=635.12s)]
*  He doesn't really even start. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  So it's not like SAR is the first guy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=636.64s)]
*  That's the Marvin Williams core, Larry. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=638.2800000000001s)]
*  Remember, he couldn't start on North Carolina. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=640.32s)]
*  And it was like, oh, Atlanta is probably going to take him second. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=642.64s)]
*  And all of us were like, what? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=646.4399999999999s)]
*  Based on the potential of he was pretty good. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  I get it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=654.88s)]
*  But it was just I want you to be able to start for your own team in college. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=655.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=660.1199999999999s)]
*  But wasn't Booker off the bench? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  Was he? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=663.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=664.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=665.88s)]
*  I thought he played big minutes though. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=666.1199999999999s)]
*  Did he? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=667.4799999999999s)]
*  I thought he was like 26 minutes a game for them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=667.92s)]
*  Look, Marvin was the same thing. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=670.0s)]
*  But I'm just, I'm double checking. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=672.56s)]
*  They took, they took him over Chris Paul. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  That's where the, that's where it fell apart. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=675.92s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=679.04s)]
*  That's, that's obviously like, I'm positive Chris Paul is good. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=680.1199999999999s)]
*  Watching basketball. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  He's that guy's going to be in the league for a long, long time. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=685.1199999999999s)]
*  Um, the Reed Shepherd one is the other one that is, yeah, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=688.68s)]
*  Booker came off the bench. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  He played 20 minutes a game. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=693.2399999999999s)]
*  So I'm just, yeah, I'm just pointing it out. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=695.28s)]
*  Cause I remember like, it can't be a hard and fast rule and there's almost no hard [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  and fast rule in sports. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=701.16s)]
*  I'll give that as well. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=702.08s)]
*  But look, I liked Marvin and when you watch Devon, you're like, wow, this [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=703.24s)]
*  guy's, this guy looks like he's pretty good. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=706.32s)]
*  Booker didn't even go second though. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=707.84s)]
*  No, but it's every, every time we talk about these guys, you're just going to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=709.72s)]
*  come back around to like, I can't believe I have to, I have to take one of them. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=713.96s)]
*  But that's kind of where we started though. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  Think about where we started this whole thing where I think you and I are both [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  hearing from teams that it's like, don't, don't start writing this stuff down in [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=722.32s)]
*  pen because it seems like there's been this, this SAR, Zach back and forth one or [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  two deal, and then the questions are at three. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=732.72s)]
*  Can it be castle at three? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=736.6s)]
*  Can it be Klingon or three? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=737.64s)]
*  Which I think Klingon probably feels like the hottest name of like be ready for [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=739.0s)]
*  maybe something a little bit weird, but I kind of can't wait now. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=742.16s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=746.64s)]
*  Cause I think we might be in for some big surprises. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=747.48s)]
*  It's like a bad NFL draft. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=749.48s)]
*  Cause the other one that I like who, for number one, who is way down there, he's [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  a hundred to one on Fandel. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=757.0s)]
*  I don't understand that as castle. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=759.3199999999999s)]
*  Cause castle is another one where you're like, I know what this guy is. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=761.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the ceiling of it is, but worst case scenario, I know what it is. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=764.8s)]
*  I know he could be on a really good team. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  I know he would be able to defend. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=770.8s)]
*  There's some point guard upside with him. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=772.64s)]
*  There's some, maybe he was used incorrectly offensively in Connecticut [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=775.0s)]
*  because how good they were and on a different team, there might be more there. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=778.48s)]
*  But worst case scenario, I get somebody who's just a really good athlete who can [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=781.88s)]
*  defend multiple positions and switch and do all the things I need to do if I'm [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  winning, maybe, maybe that's enough for this draft, you know, hundred to one. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=789.96s)]
*  You're less bullish than that one. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  Um, well, I love it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  I love the payout on it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=800.9200000000001s)]
*  Then the castle part. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=803.0s)]
*  And I know you didn't mean to say incorrectly cause you can't be like, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=804.44s)]
*  Oh, they used them wrong when they win another title and offensively. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=806.8s)]
*  I know exactly what you mean. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=810.76s)]
*  So I'm not like trying to correct you like a French open broadcast, but when [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=811.72s)]
*  you have Spencer and you have Newton, there wasn't really going to be an [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=817.76s)]
*  opportunity for castle to be a point card. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=822.0s)]
*  And that's been the thing that his group has been banging the drum on throughout [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=824.96s)]
*  the entire pre-draft process is that he's a point guard, he's a point card. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=828.4s)]
*  And I don't know if it's because they're trying to, I don't know how many people [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=831.96s)]
*  would scare away in this draft. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=835.64s)]
*  Like his floor is probably five. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=836.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=838.6s)]
*  Now he's had some nice offensive games, but I'll, I'll admit what we saw. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  It never, it never looked like a point guard. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=844.92s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=847.68s)]
*  And I didn't watch his high school stuff. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=848.1999999999999s)]
*  So I'm not informed to just cross it out. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=849.52s)]
*  But even in the times that he had the ball at Yukon, I'm like, wait, this [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=852.4399999999999s)]
*  guy's a point guard and it was funny cause I was talking to him. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=856.24s)]
*  Well, let's be honest. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=859.8s)]
*  He's not a point guard. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=860.52s)]
*  He can play point guard. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=862.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  But to what I think both of us are aligned where either a point guard or not. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  Don't you can't talk me into thinking you might be a point guard. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=868.4799999999999s)]
*  But I think his point is he probably wants to be able to handle [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=872.0799999999999s)]
*  the ball more than it did. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=874.4s)]
*  Cause I started thinking about like the bigger guys and I don't want to just [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  come up with a list and makes it sound like I'm right while I'm admitting some [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=879.2399999999999s)]
*  other people, but if you think about the history of these bigger guards that are [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=881.56s)]
*  like, actually I'm a point guard. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=884.3599999999999s)]
*  You know, like, what do you mean? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=886.3599999999999s)]
*  Like Chris Dunn or Emmanuel Moudier or Jared Culver. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=887.04s)]
*  Does it work out a lot? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=892.28s)]
*  You know, Iguodala was a really interesting one. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=893.64s)]
*  So if Castle's Iguodala, then he should go number one. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=901.64s)]
*  But I think what if Castle's like slightly poor man's Iguodala. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=903.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=907.92s)]
*  He may have just had Spencer and Newton and Caravan and Klingon and all these [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=908.0s)]
*  unbelievable players, maybe they were just all in his way, but I watched a lot [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=912.16s)]
*  of Yukon and I never thought pre-draft we'd be hearing, Oh no, no, he's actually, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=917.48s)]
*  he's actually just a point guard. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=924.6800000000001s)]
*  And again, I didn't watch the high school stuff, but I've seen plenty of guys that [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  said they were point guards in high school and it's like, were you, were you, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  were you, or were you just the guy who scored all the time? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=931.36s)]
*  Cause you had the ball and you were that much better than everybody else. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=934.0400000000001s)]
*  Cause you're going to be a lottery pick in two years. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, do the exercise again, cut out the top seven picks, pretend there's a top [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=938.0400000000001s)]
*  seven ahead of everyone in this draft and the first pick is the eighth pick, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=942.44s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=946.4s)]
*  And castle going ninth in a normal draft would seem totally reasonable. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=947.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=950.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=952.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=954.16s)]
*  I mean, there's some of these guys are really like it seven or eight or not. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=954.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=958.24s)]
*  The Reed Shepard is the other one. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=959.9599999999999s)]
*  That's fun because the shooting stats are amazing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=961.1999999999999s)]
*  He puts together a great mix tape. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  There's a, his worst case scenario is 15 years from now, there's an [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=967.4s)]
*  incredible Reed Shepard was a problem. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=971.04s)]
*  Exclamation point, mixed tape of all his Kentucky and some of his crunch time [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=973.04s)]
*  stuff, but I don't think he's Peyton Pritchard, but my question would be how, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=978.48s)]
*  how much better than Peyton Pritchard is he? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=985.36s)]
*  And that's what I'd want to know if I was going to take them with like [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=988.08s)]
*  the third pick in this draft. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=990.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=991.72s)]
*  Is he a bench guy? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=992.44s)]
*  Is he a starting point guard? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=993.64s)]
*  Do you feel like he could be a poor man? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=994.96s)]
*  Steve Nash? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=996.52s)]
*  Do you feel like he can play off the ball with a bigger guard? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=997.84s)]
*  I just have questions. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1001.24s)]
*  I love that you're talking about him as if he's not as good as Peyton Pritchard. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1003.44s)]
*  But that's the other question is what if he's just Peyton Pritchard? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1009.24s)]
*  Would you take Peyton Pritchard with the third pick in this draft? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1012.6s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1015.32s)]
*  I don't know that people loved it when Ainge took him when he took him [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1017.04s)]
*  the first time around. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1019.28s)]
*  So, uh, he, he measured out all right, probably what you expected just under six, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1020.08s)]
*  two, I mean, the shooting, you want to talk about somebody else coming off the bench [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1025.12s)]
*  that's going to go really high. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1027.76s)]
*  I mean, he only started five games in college. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1028.92s)]
*  And the shooting numbers are just so absurd that I think this is where you look at [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1031.6s)]
*  the Spurs and go, can we get a shooter in a wing? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1035.48s)]
*  Can we get a shooter in a wing? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1039.36s)]
*  That's what's so crazy. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1040.48s)]
*  Imagine if San Antonio had won the lottery, maybe do they put Klingon next to [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1041.2s)]
*  Wemba Nyama to say, we're just going to put another body, but then it's then are [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1046.44s)]
*  you actually worried about him getting in the way or you can't imagine that they [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1049.8799999999999s)]
*  they'd want to put SAR with them? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1055.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1058.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1059.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1059.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1060.5200000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1060.92s)]
*  I feel like they want, don't you feel like they just want wings who can handle [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1061.3200000000002s)]
*  the ball a little bit, throw an entry pass? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1065.8000000000002s)]
*  Entry passes would be compliment, compliment Wemba. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1068.88s)]
*  Just be able to get the ball to him and be able to switch on defense would be [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1072.3200000000002s)]
*  the only two things. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1075.7600000000002s)]
*  Everything else would be a bonus at that point. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1076.68s)]
*  Can you switch on D? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  Can you throw a pass? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1080.0s)]
*  Do you think the entry pass is going to become the 300 game winner in baseball? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1081.7600000000002s)]
*  Like we'll track the last guy that could throw an entry pass. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1086.92s)]
*  I, there was all this Bill Walton stuff was, was running over the last couple [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1090.88s)]
*  of weeks and there was a couple like. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1095.2800000000002s)]
*  Bird just throwing an entry pass to Walton and then cutting around him. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1097.88s)]
*  And I was more impressed just like the entry pass, how he would bounce it, get [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1101.1200000000001s)]
*  him at the certain thing. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  It feels like just a lost art, but also nobody posts up anymore. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1106.2800000000002s)]
*  So maybe nobody had maybe a nice side to throw it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1109.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm really glad you said that because I didn't want to sound as old as we just [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9uyCMP4A&t=1112.0400000000002s)]
