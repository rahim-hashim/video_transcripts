# The Celtics’ Jaylen Brown Problem | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U)
*  There's a Jalen Brown conversation that's kind of brewing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not a bad thing. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=3.74s)]
*  There's nobody like taking sides. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=5.7s)]
*  It's, it's not damaging in any way yet, but it's just been an interesting subplot [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=8.1s)]
*  to an 11 and three Celtic season, especially considering he signed for $304 million [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=12.82s)]
*  extension last summer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=17.06s)]
*  Um, I got, I got this tweet forwarded me to a bunch of times today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=20.02s)]
*  And it was from somebody whose Twitter name is R Y B underscore three 11. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=25.5s)]
*  And he said, Jalen Brown got it better than anyone. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  Super max money. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=36.16s)]
*  If the team loses its tatum is fault, lowest expectations of any all star. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=37.34s)]
*  No one even cares when he plays like shit outside the playoffs, not expected to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=42.54s)]
*  play, make not expected to guard the first, second or third option. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=45.9s)]
*  Multiple people in my life sent me this text, including people who aren't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=50.22s)]
*  Boston fans, because I think people want there to be a Jalen Brown conversation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=54.3s)]
*  because he got all this money. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=58.94s)]
*  It's like, Oh, this is, there's going to be a Jalen thing at the same time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=60.18s)]
*  I am on a lot of texts like, God damn it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=63.98s)]
*  What the hell is going on with Jalen Brown is, is it panic time yet? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=66.06s)]
*  Where are we with this? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, R Y B underscore 11 spot on, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=70.69999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he is like, that is a spot on tweet. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=74.02s)]
*  Um, I mean, I think with Jalen Brown, Bill, like I think with him, the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  conversation, how much is really different, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=80.0s)]
*  Like the sloppy ball handling. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=83.06s)]
*  That's nothing new. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=84.94000000000001s)]
*  We saw him have as many turnovers as he did shots and a finals game against the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=85.84s)]
*  warriors. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=90.56s)]
*  We saw him do it again against the heat in game seven last year when he had eight [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  turnovers, eight made shots, the four shots aren't anything new. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=94.34s)]
*  I think what's changed with the way we're perceiving Jalen Brown is the fact that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  now with Boston, they have Chris taps, poor Zingas and with poor Zingas, he's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=103.26s)]
*  shooting 11.9 times per game to 17.8 for Jalen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=107.66000000000001s)]
*  So even though Jalen is sacrificing a little bit, he was at 19, 20 shots per [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=111.22s)]
*  game the last three seasons. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=115.3s)]
*  Now you have him who is, let's just be real. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=117.26s)]
*  Like he's inefficient in the half court compared to some of his all star peers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=120.3s)]
*  And now you have him with Chris tops, poor Zingas who has a 67% true shooting [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=125.42s)]
*  this year, Jalen Brown is at 54% true shooting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=129.3s)]
*  So he's, he's in this situation where his role is effectively the same as it's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=132.42s)]
*  been in recent years, just a little bit, you know, fewer shots per game. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=136.38s)]
*  When poor Zingas, meanwhile, is been amazing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=140.26s)]
*  He looks like he should be the second option or should at least close the gap [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=144.54s)]
*  with Brown. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=148.74s)]
*  So I think that's where not much has changed other than the other guy on the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=149.18s)]
*  team that should be getting more shots and Chris steps, poor Zingas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=153.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=157.06s)]
*  I mean, you could argue poor Zingas should be the second option and really [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=157.3s)]
*  Derek Whiter drew holiday, destroying whoever the weak defensive guard is on [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=161.06s)]
*  the other team and putting that guard in a pick and roll and running it with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=165.34s)]
*  anybody else in the team. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=168.54s)]
*  That could be the third option. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=169.58s)]
*  It's weird to say this because Jalen's in an incredible situation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=172.26s)]
*  This is probably the most talented team in the league. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=176.66s)]
*  I think them and Denver are the, are the two favorites right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=179.42s)]
*  Still Murray will come back at some point and Jalen's in an awesome spot for a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=182.34s)]
*  lot of the reasons laid out in that tweet, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=186.94s)]
*  It's, it's all anything he does is additive positive. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=188.86s)]
*  If he's playing well, doing well, all that stuff. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=192.74s)]
*  I just wonder if this is a great situation for him because you could say [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=194.62s)]
*  he's the fifth most valuable guy in this team. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't mean he's the fifth best player, but you saw like when white is and white [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  they lose to Charlotte on Monday night, white son in the game, they're one and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=207.34s)]
*  two without white, they're 10 and one with white, including the one loss was [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=210.34s)]
*  that Philly game that was pretty close. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=215.02s)]
*  They lost by three and it came down to the last play. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  Poor Zingas, the stuff that he's brought to the Celtics. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=220.02s)]
*  Has been honestly way better than I think any of us ever expected. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=222.82s)]
*  He seems super happy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=227.26s)]
*  He's in a really, really, really, really good offensive player. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=229.46s)]
*  I have no idea how long he's going to stay healthy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=233.94s)]
*  I think every game with poor Zingas is a knock on wood and it's like at some [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=236.1s)]
*  point he'll probably get hurt for three weeks. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=240.3s)]
*  Like I'm just factoring that in Tatum. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=241.86s)]
*  I think has been maybe 2% better than it was last year and the white holiday [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=243.94s)]
*  combo are great. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=248.78s)]
*  So whatever Jalen brings to the table is, is basically a bonus, but this is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=249.7s)]
*  also a guy who's taken 18 shots a game. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=254.7s)]
*  Who's taken a few times the biggest shot of a game, whether you wanted to him [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=257.34s)]
*  to or not. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=261.74s)]
*  And that's the little tug of war. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=263.06s)]
*  I mentioned this two weeks ago after that Minnesota game, they get a stop. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=264.38s)]
*  Get the ball 10 seconds left. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=268.74s)]
*  Missoula should have called a timeout. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=270.1s)]
*  He didn't Jalen had the ball at half court. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=271.3s)]
*  He had, I think McDaniel's on it might've been Edwards. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=273.62s)]
*  It was one of the biggest shots in the game. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=275.94s)]
*  And it was just became clear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=277.66s)]
*  It was like, Oh, we're headed toward a hero ball, J one three. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=278.94s)]
*  And it's like, his odds just aren't good on this 30s going against an awesome [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=281.58s)]
*  defender and I am not confident he's going to make this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=284.74s)]
*  He misses it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=287.42s)]
*  Then it goes to overtime. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=288.54s)]
*  The question for me, KSC is how much does he have to sacrifice? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=290.5s)]
*  How much does he think he has to sacrifice? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=295.86s)]
*  And does he want to sacrifice for this team to ultimately reach its destiny? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=298.74s)]
*  That's going to be the question for me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=303.58s)]
*  I think there's going to be a point where I think poor Zingis is going to have to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  close the gap in shots per game. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=308.66s)]
*  You're going to, like you said, Derek White's had some moments, drew holidays, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  going to take plenty of shots as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=313.54s)]
*  So I would expect at some point Jalen's 17.8 shots per game comes down. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  How much does he want to do that? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=319.62s)]
*  I mean, like sometimes with some of the shots he takes, doesn't it feel like [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=320.94s)]
*  he's trying to prove that he deserves the 300 million instead of just doing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=324.54s)]
*  what is ultimately best for the team. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=330.1s)]
*  Like he had that shot the other night, obviously the one that everybody was [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  talking about, the three poor Zingis is pretty open in the paint. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=334.62s)]
*  Didn't find him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  Pretty open. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  He was wide open. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  Wide open. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=339.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the Charlotte announcers are like, Oh my God, he had poor Zingis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=340.5s)]
*  I mean, like moments like that, that's where like I struggle to say it's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=346.62s)]
*  because he's trying to prove himself when he's always had moments of tunnel [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  vision and he misses guys. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=354.06s)]
*  Jalen Brown has always been somebody who scores and he's always been a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=355.86s)]
*  somebody who scores and isn't somebody who elevates his teammates. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=360.58s)]
*  That's why I think, you know, like, yes, maybe you could ask, he could, you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=363.9s)]
*  know, have a bigger star, star role on another team. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=368.46s)]
*  Is this the best for him? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=372.26s)]
*  That's what you said earlier. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=373.62s)]
*  In a way, I think it is because this is where he doesn't have that pressure to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=375.5s)]
*  be the guy, because I don't think Jalen Brown is the guy who elevates all of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=379.7s)]
*  his teammates. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=384.26s)]
*  He's not the playmaker. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  He's not the guy who's a shot creator. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=386.38s)]
*  And with this team, the way it's constructed, there's flaws in terms of like [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=389.02s)]
*  them getting to the rim, getting to the free throw line, they don't roll the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=393.46s)]
*  basket or bottom 10 and, you know, getting the basket with Jalen, it's, it's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=397.46s)]
*  the offense where everybody shares that creation load. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=402.9s)]
*  I don't think it would be good for Jalen if he were the, if it were all on him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=406.42s)]
*  To do that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know what that looks like? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=411.26s)]
*  In the future, it ends up booking like the Chicago Bulls and a couple of these [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=412.14s)]
*  other teams we have, or it's like, all right, Zach, I'll be in your best player. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=415.38s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=418.14s)]
*  Winning is the best for him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  The library. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=420.58s)]
*  Like this is what's best for him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=421.09999999999997s)]
*  So it's really about, this is where the Celtics need to figure out, particularly [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=422.58s)]
*  Jalen Brown, considering all the talent that's around him now, what is my place [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=426.82s)]
*  in the team and what are the things that I can do that leads us to winning a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=431.06s)]
*  championship and taking 18 shots per game. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=434.82s)]
*  There will be nights that he should be taking 18, 19, 20 plus shots per game, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  but there's going to be a lot of nights where I think his best role is going to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=441.78s)]
*  be 10, 11, 12 shots per game and shooting more spot up three pointers. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=444.3s)]
*  Cause I think with them, like at the beginning of the season, there were [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=449.18s)]
*  sometimes Jalen would dribble the ball up the floor and back his man down into [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=451.7s)]
*  post-ups, inefficient looks. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=455.46s)]
*  That's not his game. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=457.34s)]
*  And I think with him, I would like to see Boston again, like to me, this is all [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=458.86s)]
*  about poor Zingas here with the Jalen frustration that some Celtics fans are [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=463.7s)]
*  feeling right now it's because of the other option and Chris steps, poor Zingas [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=467.86s)]
*  is one of the league's most efficient post scores going back to last season. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=471.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=476.38s)]
*  Like you heard me on Verna with the podcast earlier this year, the year he [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=476.62s)]
*  had with the wizards, nobody's watching the wizards. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=479.65999999999997s)]
*  It could be a good stats, you know, bad team type of situation, but poor Zingas [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=482.34s)]
*  looked like an improved guy last year with Washington. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=486.9s)]
*  It's carrying over this year with Boston where he is just beaten up smaller guys [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=489.38s)]
*  when they switch on post-ups. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=495.14s)]
*  And I don't think the Celtics are finding him enough. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=497.06s)]
*  There was a play against the Grizzlies on what Sunday, Saturday, whatever night [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  that game was Sunday night. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  And like, I think it was John Conchard got switched onto poor Zingas. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=504.06s)]
*  Poor Zingas has like a foot on him. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=507.94s)]
*  And meanwhile, Drew Holliday had an ISO against Jaren Jackson, Jr. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=509.78000000000003s)]
*  Like why is Drew Holliday taking a contested ISO jumper against Jaren Jackson, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=513.5s)]
*  Jr. When poor Zingas has amazing post positioning on conchard. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=518.62s)]
*  So I think the Celtics collectively need to figure out how do we get poor [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=522.1800000000001s)]
*  Zingas more than just 12 shots per game, because he's been that good going back [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=526.18s)]
*  the last season and I would like to see his usage tick up over the course of the year. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=530.38s)]
*  Yeah. And some of this is this we've only a few weeks into this season. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=534.62s)]
*  40% of the starting five is new. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=538.5s)]
*  These guys are all trying to figure it out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=540.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's why this is not a oh, the Jalen Brown thing is not working out. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=542.34s)]
*  This is just like this is a discussion. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=546.66s)]
*  I think anybody who watches the Celtics all the time, it's the number one thing [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=548.46s)]
*  people are talking about. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=551.98s)]
*  How is he going to tweak his game to fit into this embarrassment of riches where, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=553.5s)]
*  you know, there's moments where if the other team's guards suck, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=558.58s)]
*  White and Holliday can just dominate a game or they can dominate a half. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=561.94s)]
*  If Tatum is feeling it like he was in Charlotte last night, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=565.42s)]
*  you kind of have to ride that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=568.46s)]
*  I think the thing the thing that surprised me with Jalen, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=569.66s)]
*  because I I really like Jalen, like I have actually I've been [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=572.74s)]
*  I've been defending him in some of these cases, though. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=575.94s)]
*  The Miami series was indefensible. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=579.94s)]
*  He was terrible. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  But I think for the most part, he's got some faults the same way [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=582.74s)]
*  some other great players does. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  But he brings so much else to the table [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=587.18s)]
*  that you want to forgive some of the stuff where it's like, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=589.54s)]
*  I wish he wouldn't do that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=592.1s)]
*  You know, like if Westbrook's the number one person of all time like that, Jalen's, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=593.26s)]
*  you know, he's below, but he's not that far below. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=598.2199999999999s)]
*  Oh, man. Oh, he's going to do the thing where he tries to dribble through five guys. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=600.66s)]
*  Don't do that, Jalen. Come on. You're gonna lose the ball. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=603.78s)]
*  But I think he plays hard. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=606.06s)]
*  I think he's unafraid. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=608.3s)]
*  He certainly has the confidence of somebody who's been in 105 [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=610.94s)]
*  playoff games and some real wars already and had to guard people like LeBron [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=614.6600000000001s)]
*  and Jimmy Butler, people like that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=619.3800000000001s)]
*  What's interesting about situations in now is he's in this role [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=621.98s)]
*  that I think Chris Bosch got was in with Miami. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=625.7s)]
*  You know, seen it over the years. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=629.4200000000001s)]
*  Doc Rivers talked about on my podcast last week where it's like, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=630.62s)]
*  it's actually better for the team. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=633.62s)]
*  If you double down on the defense, on the little stuff, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=636.5s)]
*  maybe take some drop down to 14 shots [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=639.9000000000001s)]
*  and become more of an all around guy, that's going to be more impactful. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=643.74s)]
*  We have a big enough sample size KOC. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=647.1800000000001s)]
*  He's not in most of the best lineups this team has had. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=651.0200000000001s)]
*  And it's it's pretty eye opening. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=654.5s)]
*  Like Brian Barrett had some stats about when when he's on the court. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=656.5s)]
*  He got this from cleaning the glass there plus seven point four net. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  And when he's off the court, they're plus sixteen point four. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=665.74s)]
*  It's it's not a giant difference, but it's not nothing either. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=668.3s)]
*  When he's just this year, he's shooting forty four point eight percent [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=672.9799999999999s)]
*  from the field, but he's fifty two point two percent on twos, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=677.6999999999999s)]
*  which is eighty third in the league at the rim. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=682.5s)]
*  He's thirty eight for sixty eight, which is the twenty eighth percentile. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=685.74s)]
*  And then the minutes when Tatum isn't out there, the team's minus, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=689.74s)]
*  they have a one oh eight rating and Barrett said only three teams were south of that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=693.6999999999999s)]
*  This season, there's also some usage rate stuff with him. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=697.22s)]
*  So twenty nine players in the league have a twenty eight usage rate or higher. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=700.58s)]
*  Only twenty nine with thirty team league. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=704.82s)]
*  He's got the third lowest assist percentage behind Wemby and Cam Thomas. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=707.46s)]
*  Wow. Not sure that's the company you want to be in. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=711.5400000000001s)]
*  He's twenty third in true shooting out of the twenty nine. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=713.9s)]
*  And just for per thirty six, he's one hundred and nineteenth in assist. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=717.0600000000001s)]
*  So what we're getting is like this guy who really should be the do dog, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  glue guy, kind of what he was in the end of the 2010s, where it's like, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=726.5s)]
*  I'll just do everything else. I'm here to help. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=730.18s)]
*  But he doesn't seem to think that that's who he is. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=732.82s)]
*  And how that tug of war with him and Missoula [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=735.82s)]
*  and the rest of the lineup and the better options they have, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=739.34s)]
*  how he kind of figures out his place to me is the ceiling of this team. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=741.98s)]
*  Even more so than Tatum reaching an even higher level. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=747.26s)]
*  You think Jalen Brown is going to be that X factor? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=750.3s)]
*  I do. I because I still think Tatum is probably a year away [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=753.02s)]
*  from being the guy that he's ultimately going to be. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=756.7s)]
*  Is this year the big difference was he got stronger. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=758.9000000000001s)]
*  And when you talked about Porzingis punishing smaller people, Tatum [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=761.9000000000001s)]
*  could do that, too. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=765.22s)]
*  And they have this superpower that they did not have last year, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=766.02s)]
*  where if you go smaller against them, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=769.26s)]
*  they're going to find a matchup and beat you in the paint [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=772.6600000000001s)]
*  and get a ten footer, an eight footer, a six footer [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=775.5s)]
*  with either Tatum or Porzingis against a smaller guy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=777.98s)]
*  Last year, remember, was Horford was basically the guy [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=780.78s)]
*  they would do that with. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=783.06s)]
*  I know that the results were mixed. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=783.94s)]
*  So they have that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=786.1s)]
*  And that's what Drew has like. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=786.9s)]
*  I'd kind of forgotten he's got this crafty, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=789.18s)]
*  herky jerky post up game he can go to sometimes. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=791.34s)]
*  So they have ways, depending on who you're throwing at them [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=793.78s)]
*  to punish them. But then you see last night, it's like, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=797.38s)]
*  why weren't they attacking LaMelo in the fourth quarter and in overtime? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=799.26s)]
*  That guy can't guard anybody. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=803.46s)]
*  You know, I know he guarded Halliburton on that one play, but that's just somebody [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=804.82s)]
*  I would want to be attacking whoever he's on. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=808.78s)]
*  But with the Jalen thing, it's just not the best matchup most of the time. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=812.54s)]
*  And I think. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=817.42s)]
*  He might be one of the last ones to realize that is the fear [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=819.14s)]
*  I have with the with the X Factor piece. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=822.58s)]
*  Is there a point where, I mean, even if he doesn't realize it, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=825.14s)]
*  that he could be forced into that type of role? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=828.34s)]
*  I mean, like, could there be situations that come this season? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=831.78s)]
*  Like, yeah, Boston's been one of the best teams in the league, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=834.46s)]
*  but there probably will be a moment that [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=836.58s)]
*  Mazzulli doesn't have him on the floor in a big moment [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=839.7s)]
*  because he's riding one of those great lineups that you're talking about [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=843.14s)]
*  where it's featuring role players. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think with Jalen, there could come a moment where that happens. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=848.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, then it like selfish win the game and becomes an even bigger conversation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=851.22s)]
*  And like we're on this podcast again, talking about, well, where's Jalen's place [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=854.94s)]
*  with Jalen, it might be his choice, but it can also be the team saying, hey, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=858.7s)]
*  like, this is what we need from you. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=862.1s)]
*  Like this has been your role in recent years. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=863.86s)]
*  But look at past championship teams like you mentioned, Chris Bosch, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=865.74s)]
*  that Doc on the ground sacrifice. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=869.0600000000001s)]
*  Clay Thompson, Clay Thompson during the Durant years, he sacrificed his shit. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=871.1800000000001s)]
*  He took three, four less shots a game. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=875.38s)]
*  And ultimately, that's what leads to winning. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=877.54s)]
*  Well, what is best for the team if taking, you know, 13, 14 shots [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=879.86s)]
*  instead of 18, 19, 20 plus like last season [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=883.74s)]
*  is what leads the team to winning a championship. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=887.1s)]
*  Then you got to do it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=889.74s)]
*  And with Boston, like you got to look around that locker room [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=890.9s)]
*  and see the amount of talent that's around you, whether it's obviously Tatum [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=893.62s)]
*  is the best player on the team. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=897.3s)]
*  But K.P. Drew, Derek White, other guys that can have like hot shooting nights [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=898.38s)]
*  where maybe just the ball finds them more often with Jalen. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=902.9s)]
*  We saw him, like you said, the late 2010s when he was younger in his career, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=905.78s)]
*  a pre all star, he could lock in more often and do some of that stuff on defense. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=909.3s)]
*  He became a better spot up shooter. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=914.74s)]
*  He was a 40% guy off the catch for two or three straight seasons. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=916.7s)]
*  And he hasn't been for, I think, since 2021. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=920.34s)]
*  So like if he if he can get the catch and shoot three point number back up to 40%, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=923.5400000000001s)]
*  that gives him more value even when he's not run, pick and roll or not isolating. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=927.62s)]
*  So Jalen, like he's like I think with the Boston, like we're nitpicking [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=931.86s)]
*  because this is what you do with championship contenders. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=935.98s)]
*  Like you find what is the weak spot, what could hold them back? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=938.9s)]
*  What do they need to solve? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=941.94s)]
*  And well, and a guy who signed a three hundred four million dollar contract. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=943.5400000000001s)]
*  We're nitpicking because he has a huge salary cap figure. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=947.46s)]
*  And that's just the fact for sure. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=950.34s)]
*  And if they fall short this year, he's the guy that they probably move next summer. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=951.94s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=956.9000000000001s)]
*  Listen, the Red Sox sucks. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=958.2600000000001s)]
*  The Patriots have been an absolute abomination. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=960.1800000000001s)]
*  So the Celtics have the Bruins are doing well. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=962.58s)]
*  But for me personally, like I'm more into the Celtic season [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=965.74s)]
*  than than I normally would be because the Pats have been so sad. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=969.7800000000001s)]
*  And we've also been watching Jalen now since 2016. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=973.1s)]
*  And when you when you spend that much time with a player just day in day out, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=976.5400000000001s)]
*  you kind of get to know after a while, all right, he's going to do this [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=980.98s)]
*  or this is going to happen. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=983.74s)]
*  And one thing with Jalen this year, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=985.1800000000001s)]
*  if he doesn't get the ball for three, four minutes, it's going up. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=987.58s)]
*  And you just know it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=991.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's sitting on the couch watching the TV [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=992.38s)]
*  being 2000 miles away from where the game is. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=994.82s)]
*  It's like he'll get the ball over half court. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=997.22s)]
*  And it's like, oh, he's shooting this. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=999.54s)]
*  It's he is that one for now. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1001.34s)]
*  Tatum, same thing. But Tatum is a better offensive player. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1003.14s)]
*  I just feels like there's been some [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1006.26s)]
*  which started last year because he took 21 shots a game last year, 20.6, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1010.38s)]
*  something like that. So it was happening last year, too. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1014.5799999999999s)]
*  But it made more sense last year because they didn't have poor Zingas. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1017.4599999999999s)]
*  They didn't have Drew Holiday. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1020.42s)]
*  Smart was, you know, always going to be the inferior offensive player in the team. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1022.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, Jalen's the in my opinion, the fifth. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1027.22s)]
*  The fifth option, if I really need a basket against a good team [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1031.3799999999999s)]
*  and like that Minnesota game was a really good example. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1035.3s)]
*  There's just not good options for against if they're guarding him [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1039.42s)]
*  with McDaniels or Edwards, who's invested in actually playing, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1042.3400000000001s)]
*  trying to play defense with those guys with Gobert, protecting the rim. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1045.8600000000001s)]
*  Jalen's not necessarily the best matchup for us in that game, you know, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1050.46s)]
*  and whether the light bulb goes off with him or not, I just don't know. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1053.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't. When you're 27 as an NBA player, you kind of are who you are. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1058.02s)]
*  It's not a lot of not a lot of change, not a lot of growth at that point. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1063.5s)]
*  So this this might be who he is. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1066.54s)]
*  So do you all at all worry about like, I think these last two games [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1070.42s)]
*  against Memphis and Charlotte, the inability to get to the basket with any consistency. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1074.0600000000002s)]
*  I mentioned earlier, like their bottom 10 and free throw rate, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1079.5s)]
*  bottom 10 and ad rim shot the whole team, the whole team, even bottom 10. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1082.02s)]
*  And for that matter, in consecutive years now, like when you set a pick and roll, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1086.02s)]
*  rolling to the basket, it's a team that pops even poor Zingas. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1090.26s)]
*  Like poor Zingas can shoot off the catch pick and pop and all that. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1093.5800000000002s)]
*  But I think getting to the rim more often would be nice to see them [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1096.22s)]
*  experiment with over the course of the season, forcing some of those at rim shots [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1099.98s)]
*  instead of driving, kick, forcing some of those roles to the basket with poor Zingas, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1104.5s)]
*  try to get some lob opportunities. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1108.8600000000001s)]
*  He can finish off one or two bounces as well on his way to the basket. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1110.5800000000002s)]
*  I just I'd like to see that because we know the team is good. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1113.8600000000001s)]
*  We know they're going to be in the playoffs. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1116.3400000000001s)]
*  I just like to see them add that, you know, wrinkle to their offense, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1117.7s)]
*  just like you're talking about the post ups earlier. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1121.46s)]
*  That's a great addition. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1123.98s)]
*  It's awesome to have that with poor Zingas and Tatum. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1125.06s)]
*  I think a little bit more rim attacking would be something that Joe [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1127.58s)]
*  Mazzulli should look at over the course of the season, too. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1131.54s)]
*  Well, there are 11 and three. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1134.3s)]
*  We mentioned the Philly loss, Philly outplayed them that game, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1136.6599999999999s)]
*  but they still had a chance to tie up poor Zingas missed a three [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1139.1799999999998s)]
*  that could have sent into overtime. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1142.1799999999998s)]
*  They lost to Minnesota in overtime in a game that they had the ball. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1143.94s)]
*  The Charlotte loss yesterday was disgusting, but it was also no Derek White. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1147.82s)]
*  And it's, you know, Thanksgiving week. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1151.98s)]
*  You can't totally overreact. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1153.74s)]
*  I think that has shocked me over everything else with what you're talking about. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1156.14s)]
*  Or like, do they get to the line enough? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1160.58s)]
*  And I just can't believe how good poor Zingas is. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1162.1s)]
*  And I don't know if it's just because certain guys on a team [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1166.1s)]
*  with an embarrassment or riches, it actually makes them better [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1170.1s)]
*  because all he's doing is shooting wide open threes. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1174.3s)]
*  And then if somebody puts a small on him, he's got he's either trying to post [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1176.78s)]
*  that person up or they're trying to throw lobs to him. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1180.38s)]
*  And he's super happy. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1182.62s)]
*  It doesn't even feel like he's necessarily breaking a sweat in some of these games. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1184.06s)]
*  He's just kind of jogging around this big smile on his face. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1187.54s)]
*  And his rim protection, which we knew was kind of the sneaky piece [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1190.3s)]
*  of the poor Zingas package, I think has been pretty good. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1193.8999999999999s)]
*  But he's also not a huge foul shot guy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1196.58s)]
*  So it's going to be Tatum or it's going to be the guards. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1198.86s)]
*  But I guess my fear with this team is it's like in football [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1201.54s)]
*  when you have the team that's thrown in the first two months of the season, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1205.3799999999999s)]
*  like a Miami, it's like, oh, this looks great in October when it's 75 degrees. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1208.3s)]
*  But Kenya Audible, when we get to December, January, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1212.1s)]
*  can you start running the ball? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1215.98s)]
*  Can you start winning 1714 games? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1217.06s)]
*  I do worry about with this team a little bit when things really slow down. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1220.1s)]
*  Is it just going to be guys jacking up threes [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1224.98s)]
*  and not actually trying to run offense? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1227.62s)]
*  You know, I just what Denver can do when Murray's back. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1230.34s)]
*  Is the cheat code in the league right now? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1234.6999999999998s)]
*  And do you feel like Boston has anything like that? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1236.4599999999998s)]
*  Because I do not know. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1238.8999999999999s)]
*  They don't have that two man game like that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1240.54s)]
*  That's unstoppable. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1242.34s)]
*  There's nothing you can do about Yokochi and Murray or even like [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1243.86s)]
*  Yokochi and MPJ or Yokochi. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1247.06s)]
*  Whoever you plug and play with him, it doesn't matter. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1249.26s)]
*  He's the man in the half court and Boston. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1251.86s)]
*  It still feels like there's going to be stretches where. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1254.62s)]
*  And that's why I want to see them do a little bit more, you know, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1257.9s)]
*  wrinkles with pick and roll and just see how it looks over the course [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1260.7s)]
*  and sees them roll into the basket. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1264.14s)]
*  But that's not a that's not a cheat code either. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1265.26s)]
*  They just don't have that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1268.02s)]
*  So they're not on a level of Denver in my opinion. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1270.26s)]
*  They're a tick below. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1272.82s)]
*  Yeah, and Denver Murray's been out and now Denver's like, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1274.9s)]
*  oh, somebody beat Denver here. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1277.8600000000001s)]
*  Whoa, what is it? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1279.7s)]
*  Denver's the best team in the league. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1280.8600000000001s)]
*  And all that's happening now without Murray is their young guys [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1282.58s)]
*  are getting more experience that they're going to need more. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1286.66s)]
*  But Yokochi is there's nothing like him until until Sangoon [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1288.74s)]
*  replaces him as Yokochi 2.0, which is might be happening faster [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1295.18s)]
*  than we anticipated. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1299.18s)]
*  If I had to rank my Celtics, things I'm worried about the most. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1300.8200000000002s)]
*  To me, it's still Porzingis getting nine months at him is number one, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1306.3400000000001s)]
*  because you just have to look at his game logs and basketball reference [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1310.8200000000002s)]
*  and his injury history. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1314.38s)]
*  And, you know, I just think every day that he's out there and healthy [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1315.94s)]
*  and happy and smiling is a huge win for the Celtics. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1319.42s)]
*  That would be one. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1322.1000000000001s)]
*  Number two would be I still feel like they're a guy short. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1323.7s)]
*  And I wish they had one more guard with size that, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1328.14s)]
*  you know, in certain games against long big teams like that Minnesota team [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1332.98s)]
*  that they had somebody else with some somebody between six, four and six, six, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1337.98s)]
*  who is either a two guard or three or even a point guard. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1343.0200000000002s)]
*  Like in Austin, even if it was Austin Rivers, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1347.74s)]
*  so I've been hoping they've signed for two months, not just because he's at the ringer. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1349.8200000000002s)]
*  I thought he had good moments in Minnesota last year. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1352.9s)]
*  But one other person that gives them protection against bigger teams. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1355.3400000000001s)]
*  And then the third thing is this Jalen thing. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1358.9s)]
*  And is he going to accept the Chris Bosh piece of this? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1361.3s)]
*  Or is this just who he is the rest of the season? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iCp544S8U&t=1365.5800000000002s)]
