# The NBA MVP Title Race Is Wide Open | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYFFMKbliX4)
*  You led your podcast on Thursday.
*  You had a nice little monologue about the, uh, the MVP race and how toxic it's been.
*  And you made the same point that I made in my little quick thing I did at the
*  top that the whole reason we have all these voters is because sometimes you have
*  years where people disagree on stuff.
*  And then it comes down to, Hey, we pulled a hundred people and 60 people thought
*  this and 40 people thought this, and that's how it went.
*  I think with the MVP, to me, it's crazy how in the last, I went through all the
*  races, I wrote down every single MVP race that was separated by 150 points or less.
*  And since in the last 16 years, we've only had at one time, we've only had one
*  like actual close MVP race and it was 2017 Westbrook Hardin with Kawhi as the
*  third guy where Westbrook had 888 points, 69 first place votes.
*  Hardin had 753 points, 22 first place votes.
*  And then other than that, there's been pretty much consensus every year, which
*  is, I think the part people have missed with the Yolk and stuff the last two years.
*  Like there was pretty major consensus that he won when Bird won his three MVPs.
*  There was a ton of consensus for that.
*  For the most part, we've had consensus.
*  I went back though, I was surprised.
*  Um, both of Duncan's MVPs were way closer than I remember.
*  Do you remember that?
*  I remember the kid one being a debate.
*  I didn't remember that the next year him versus Garnett was like one of
*  the closest ones we've ever had.
*  I just remember that like Garnett felt like it's a little bit like dirt.
*  We were like, when's this guy going to win his?
*  Um, and maybe that's what MB is going through right now.
*  You know, watching these games and watch them every night and then, you know,
*  go on, wait, that guy ended up not winning one.
*  Like, when's he going to get his?
*  I mean, that was certainly the Carl Malone one where it was like, all right,
*  we got to get this guy one, which again is fucked up.
*  But, uh, I was so pro Duncan, like I was so pro Duncan every time I, I just
*  almost felt like he was still underappreciated in the moment.
*  You're like, do you understand that you're penciling your team in for
*  50 plus wins every single time?
*  And like, something has to go wrong for them.
*  Not even though they have some earlier exits, then you would maybe realize on,
*  on the team resume throughout that run.
*  But, um, yeah, I'm sure back in the day, I was always arguing with Duncan.
*  That one was nine 54 to eight 97 for Duncan kid 57 first place votes to 45 for
*  kid.
*  Yeah, really close.
*  Okay.
*  But remember, remember the newness though.
*  Like never forget voters are writers, writers, like stories.
*  They like to tell stories.
*  That's the Westbrook vote.
*  You know, Westbrook's the guy that kept the money stayed in.
*  Okay.
*  See the anti Durant triple double.
*  That's a great story, you know, so never forget the impact of storytelling,
*  uh, which is wrong, but it happens.
*  But so that shifts in the mid two thousands.
*  And I wanted to get to that the Oh three Duncan Garnett nine 62 to eight 71
*  Duncan had 60 first place boats Garnett at 43.
*  Basically they had the same season except Duncan's team is better.
*  Um, Nash Shaq is the single closest one we've had other than a Irving bird in 1981.
*  That's the old five one.
*  Yeah.
*  The, the Nash was 10 66 Shaq was 10 32.
*  Nash had 65 first place vote Shaq had 58.
*  I, I have MVP columns that you can go back and read dating back to like 2004.
*  And then I did a bunch of stuff with my book about it about the, about the
*  years I went through every year.
*  I had Shaq.
*  I voted for Shaq that year.
*  I had Nash six.
*  I was just like, I was just like, I don't see it.
*  And I had LeBron to wait over him and I had Dirk over him.
*  Wow.
*  You wait in Nash's first year with Phoenix.
*  Yeah.
*  You had him six because that's a classic, that's a classic new car smell.
*  Like Nash has completely changed this team even though there's still a
*  couple of years left in the game.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But like it was something that everybody, if you were a neutral fan, it was kind
*  of like some warrior stuff for Durant cut there and break a pissed about it,
*  which I understand, but it was like, oh, the sun's are on.
*  Like I want to watch this.
*  Yeah.
*  There's two, there's two big things that were going on.
*  Um, one was that the league was horrible to watch.
*  It was hard.
*  It was a horrible product and oh three and oh four and they changed the
*  hand check rules, but Nash, that was like just a fun team to watch.
*  And we just loved watching them and we just loved watching them.
*  And I think that's the biggest thing about the Nash is that they're
*  they're thinking like, in XัNether, and I mean, there's a lot of analyses
*  that say that it jόs an in this, that they him Ana has, I was a perfect
*  player of his game when I matched him in the defiance.
*  They don't win.
*  So we some say that's why I'm not picking them in that line.
*  I just started watching them and he got the most blame.
*  But man, when you go back and look at their stats, Oma is incredible that
*  year and the advanced stats are like really favorable to Omari that actually
*  he probably got fucked over.
*  And that one was 1138 to 1013 83 for new whiskey, 44 for Nash.
*  And new whiskey won because he was due.
*  And because of the 67 win thing, the
*  I bring this up because I think as we hit the late two thousands and the
*  internet got better and the stats got better and I, and also like the
*  backlash to people because Twitter, if you did, if you did, if you had some
*  guy who's like, I'm just, you know what?
*  I'm just voting for Jason Tatum for MVP.
*  I don't care about this Yoko Shinbi, Diana's thing.
*  I covered Tatum and, and I'm not going to go into that.
*  I'm just going to go into that.
*  I'm not going to go into that.
*  I'm not going to go into that.
*  I'm not going to go into that.
*  I'm not going to go into that.
*  I'm not going to go into that.
*  Tatum and, and I watch him and I just really value what he does.
*  And I don't really care.
*  That's going to be my vote.
*  You can't do that anymore.
*  So I think for the most part, I think if you go through, I've had the same vote
*  as the MVP since 2009 with the 17 2017 year, except that I voted for
*  hard in 2017 over Westbrook, but every other year I've had the MVP vote.
*  And I think most people had, we've just had consensus.
*  And I think one of the reasons with 2023 wads become so contentious is
*  because it's the first time we haven't had consensus with four weeks left.
*  Like it's really, to me, I don't know who I'm voting for.
*  I like, if anything, I'm, I might be a slight lean to or Embiid right now.
*  There's 14 games left.
*  And if it's okay with everybody, I'd like to watch three more weeks of
*  basketball and kind of see what happens.
*  Like Embiid had an awesome game winner the other night and be,
*  and Jokic had a chance to have game winner today.
*  He missed it.
*  Tiny moment, but it matters a little bit.
*  They're playing head to head in a week.
*  I'm going to watch that game.
*  If Embiid beats the shit out of Denver again, that's going to matter to me.
*  But my point is like, give it, can you give us the 80 games?
*  Do we have to decide in game 63 and start yelling at each other?
*  I don't understand it.
*  Well, I think the problem too, is that, you know, Tim Bontemps, who does the straw
*  poll, it came out February 16th and Jokic had 77 of a hundred and Embiid had only
*  six, which is in third place to Janis who had 11.
*  By the way, someone in the straw poll gave Duran a fifth place vote.
*  Um, you know, I mean, look, I can't.
*  Straw poll was totally fair a month ago and B, it's still over the last month.
*  It's the, it's, I know what the 76 76 vote up, but Jokic was in the lead a month ago.
*  He was like, Jokic got off to the bad start, at least on the straw poll.
*  Cause then Tatum, you know, the, what, 20 and five, 21 and five.
*  And it's like, all right, Tatum's clearly better player this year, which, you know,
*  I think we'd all agree on.
*  And then Jokic goes on his terror again.
*  And like, I mean, I could sit here all day.
*  I think that the problem is, is like, you know, the rising tide raises all boats.
*  Is it, when you look at any stats, like if I wanted to just sit here and stump for one guy,
*  I could go 30 minutes would be pretty boring podcast, but I go with 10 straight minutes.
*  And you would listen to my cell and you go, how is that guy?
*  Not the MVP.
*  And what makes it so hard this year is I could do the exact same thing with the two other guys,
*  even though Janis is metrics.
*  Some of the analytics stuff for Janis is like almost undervaluing him a little bit.
*  And I don't know if that's, you know, the plus minus stuff that comes into it gets really weird
*  because if you look at Jokic, it's off the charts, it's off the charts, but the bench is so bad.
*  So you're like, okay, he's great.
*  He's a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Where it should be one thing you look at, but not the thing.
*  No, and that's where it hurts and bead where it's like, okay, you know, and beats plus minus
*  is still really good, but do we go Jokic has that much more of an impact on a game or is
*  Philly just have a little bit more balance to it where there isn't that much of a drop off.
*  And that would be unfair to him.
*  Be I mean, there's a bunch of stuff, you know, there's a defensive one.
*  And again, I'm just kind of bringing these up because they're going to be used all the time.
*  So I'm just sort of warning everybody ahead of time.
*  If you go defensive plus minus for every player in the NBA, defensive box score plus minus,
*  do you know who's number one?
*  Tatum.
*  Jokic.
*  Really?
*  Now, every, even though I think the guy that came up with the box score plus minus thing was like,
*  it can be really flawed because if you're a terrific offensive player,
*  it's still a plus minus math that you're looking at here.
*  And Jokic is that good offensively that I think it skews into the whole thing.
*  Like there's a play, there's an alley-oop to Claxton,
*  where I actually didn't think Jokic was bad defensively today at all.
*  So we'll see what the kids on Twitter do with it.
*  They were asking him to do a lot.
*  They were having him come way out and show they were trapping Spencer Dinwood.
*  That's why he had a million assists because he was like, look,
*  they were blitzing the hell out of me.
*  He was talking about in the post game.
*  And then there's an alley-oop to Claxton where I go, okay, that's a play there where they can't
*  do that to Embiid.
*  Like they can't throw that alley-oop and have Claxton dunk it over the top of him
*  because Embiid is going to make you feel something.
*  If I want to be completely unfair to Embiid, which I wouldn't want to do
*  because I still may end up voting for him because I think he's fucking awesome
*  and he's on this absolute tear.
*  And Philadelphia is now flirting with like a real seeding thing here,
*  which would kind of cancel out where Denver felt like they were running away from it.
*  But now Philly's playing so well.
*  But if I wanted to, I could cut up some stuff of like him having to stay in front of Lillard,
*  which no center is going to be able to do, you know, which would be unfair to Embiid
*  or the times he's late to show in the first half of the three-point shooter.
*  Because guess what?
*  Guys that are seven foot one that weigh that much aren't going to close out hard
*  on three-pointers all the time.
*  So I never remember it ever being this nasty.
*  There's certainly more skin in the game for me because it's my second year with a vote
*  and I care about it this much.
*  But when I look at the defensive box score stuff, which Jokic voters will use
*  if they vote for him and will use that and say, oh, his defense actually is way better
*  and look at all the metrics because there's like contested stuff.
*  And I'm like, yeah, but my eyes don't tell me that.
*  My eyes don't tell me that he's the best defensive box score guy.
*  Even though whenever I've looked at some of that plus minus stuff, Bill,
*  I feel like it tells the truth at the extremes because after Jokic, which again is nuts,
*  Embiid's 10th, by the way, if you look at who else is in the top five,
*  it's Caruso, it's Giannis, it's Jaren Jackson, and it's Draymond Green.
*  So you're like, okay, wait, that makes sense.
*  But I think it actually speaks to the fact that Jokic is so off the charts offensively
*  that it raises some of that stuff up because, and I'll finish here,
*  if you go to the extremes of like the high usage scores that we all think suck on defense.
*  Well, who are a bunch of the negatives?
*  Oh, Dame, Beale, Jordan Poole, Trey Young, and then Jalen Green,
*  whatever Houston's trying to do right now, which I know they're trying to lose a million games.
*  It's just bad basketball to watch.
*  It's working.
*  But I would end it this way.
*  I don't know what I'm going to do.
*  And it's a really, really hard vote.
*  And it may just-
*  That's where you should have landed.
*  Why would you know what we're going to do yet?
*  There's not even in the 70 game market, you know?
*  And that's the part.
*  It should be fun that this is this wide open.
*  All of this to me is fun.
*  It's not fun.
*  It's not fun at all.
*  But on the other hand, I don't think like,
*  somebody like my dad doesn't care that people are giving other people shit on Twitter or whatever.
*  I think what's getting lost in a weird way is how great the three players have been.
*  And specifically, I want to talk about Embiid for a second.
*  I do feel like he's better this year than he was last year.
*  I do feel like-
*  And people could throw a hundred stats at me,
*  be like, no, no, actually, it's the same.
*  You look at last year and this year.
*  Like, I'm just telling you, watching the game,
*  I test like that Portland game the other night,
*  Doc calls timeout, the last play of the game,
*  Embiid's going to have a game winner.
*  He's got Nerketsh on him one on one.
*  It's a matchup you want every time.
*  And Doc calls timeout with eight seconds left so he can get Embiid a worse shot.
*  Embiid makes anyway.
*  I thought the shot was going to go in.
*  To me Embiid has reached this point where his fucking offensive toolbox that he has now,
*  his face up stuff, his ability to overpower people.
*  I was thinking about watching Ewing, like, I don't know, late 80s Ewing,
*  when he really had his knees and he was just this awesome, could face up,
*  could hit long shots, could hit the little jump hook.
*  And he had this whole package.
*  It's like, wow, Ewing, it's really got it together.
*  Like to me Embiid is just offensively better than Ewing was.
*  And Ewing was one of the 40 best players of all time.
*  He came really close to the finals a couple of times, lost to Jordan.
*  I think I'm not ready to go there with Hakeem,
*  but I think he's a better offensive player than David Robinson was.
*  I think he had more stuff to his game than Shaq ever did.
*  Shaq was a little more overpowering,
*  but Embiid I think brings more to the table.
*  And-
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  Whoa, wait a minute.
*  Say that Shaq part again.
*  I think Shaq was more overpowering.
*  But I think Embiid-
*  I think Shaq's footwork was insane, man.
*  But I'm saying like he didn't have the ability to bring people away from the basket like Embiid does.
*  I would say near the basket.
*  Yeah, this is where the generational comps-
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Sure, right. Okay.
*  I'm never ready to mess with Hakeem ever, so we can put that to bed.
*  Yeah, Hakeem, we're putting over there.
*  We're putting him on the side.
*  But I think it's just been amazing to watch Embiid's journey over the last six years
*  because he's still like the first couple years even he was gifted,
*  there was still a clumsiness to him.
*  Remember he would fall down a lot or you'd always be worried like he was going to get hurt.
*  Now-
*  I don't know that that's gone away.
*  I'm worried about him getting hurt.
*  But like a pro Embiid thing would be like there's other players who I think are really talented.
*  We talk about all the time and then you look at the playoff resume.
*  I actually never really have felt that way about him.
*  It's a good argument winner if you want to go there with somebody.
*  I just don't really want to because I like them so much.
*  And I actually have liked them this much the whole time.
*  It's like, oh, we'll get out of the second round.
*  The problem is like if Jokic wins this MVP and they don't win,
*  and they're not some overpowering Denver team, okay?
*  And I'm not just talking about this week.
*  If they don't win, Jokic-
*  It's better for Jokic not to win.
*  Let's be honest.
*  Well, I don't know about that.
*  I want to be the guy who's the third dude ever to win three MVPs in a row.
*  I'm saying from a pressure for trying to win the playoffs this year,
*  in a weird way, it's better for him if Embiid gets this MVP.
*  And then it could be like, all right, let's just try to win the title here.
*  And that's why the Yanis thing is so crazy because I have a monologue in my head that
*  I haven't quite done.
*  But we're such dicks.
*  We're dicks when we talk about these guys.
*  And Yanis was headed for Dick Town.
*  He was right in the crosshairs.
*  Bud was going to get fired.
*  It was going to be, oh, this guy, okay, cool.
*  He wins an MVP.
*  And those are just the rules.
*  And sometimes I think it's totally accurate when you're looking at somebody's
*  playoff runs and going, how come this guy doesn't win?
*  That's really what we're doing here and paying attention to.
*  And with Embiid, I'm not, I don't know, maybe I'm being too easy on him.
*  And then the Miami series last year was a mess.
*  The Toronto series-
*  The Atlanta series is the toughest one for him.
*  It is.
*  I know Simmons is a piece of that, but-
*  But that's why, that's another entry into the mind of Ben Simmons, not your kid.
*  But when he does the stuff and starts talking about what Embiid didn't do in the Toronto
*  series and you're like, fuck, are you serious?
*  At least I know when I'm watching Embiid, if he's losing the playoff series, I don't
*  even count that heat one because that whole thing was a mess.
*  I think that guy is, he's ready.
*  He's up to the task.
*  And there's some late stuff where you're a big guy.
*  The game is just tough for a bigger guy to get all of his stuff on his own anymore.
*  It's just not the really way it's played.
*  You know what?
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Do you think Jokic gets the benefit of the doubt the way a quarterback does?
*  Where when you watch Jokic control everything offensively, and he has more weapons offensively
*  as an offensive player than Embiid does.
*  I mean, the passing along, right?
*  Not that Embiid isn't a terrific passer, but I mean, Jokic stuff is insane.
*  Do you think that Jokic almost is treated like a quarterback in comparison to the non-quarterback
*  in the NFL where the voter has a hard time going, well, how can this other guy be as
*  this important as this dude who literally dictates everything they're doing in every
*  offensive set?
*  It's a good question.
*  I think you have to go back and you have to compare them to Bird and Magic and probably
*  Nash to some degree, but especially those three MVPs that Magic wins.
*  A lot of it had to do with he makes everybody better.
*  He elevates everybody.
*  Every single player he plays with is a better version of themselves because they're on
*  Magic's team.
*  And I think you could say the same about Jokic and that's the best case for him.
*  Embiid is more of the traditional, he lifts the team up because he's so good.
*  And like that shot he hit at the end of the game on Friday night, that's like the traditional
*  awesome MVP shot that we're used to, right?
*  Jokic missed his today.
*  That's not really why you have Jokic.
*  He's more of, yeah, whatever.
*  Jokic is a connector and he's an elevator and Embiid is an overpower.
*  And sometimes it can be a taste thing, which is why it's good that you have a hundred voters.
*  All right.
*  Let me ask you another question kind of along the same lines.
*  When I see these videos are popping up more and more now about Kobe and players talking
*  about Kobe, right?
*  Like there's this reverence and I think there also is this incredibly sad ending to his
*  life that's a big piece of it can prop up.
*  People just don't want to start sitting there and criticizing somebody who's not around
*  anymore, right?
*  I mean, we do it with musicians all the time or whatever, but Kobe was so impressive physically.
*  There was this dynamic ability, like beyond all the numbers on this stuff, like you knew
*  when it was like, what are you going to do with this guy?
*  You talk to other teams, right?
*  Like other people in the front office would be like that fucking guy.
*  And the same thing happens with ex players.
*  And yet I, and I'm sure plenty of people think I'm wrong here.
*  Like I would rather have Duncan to be the anchor of my franchise, especially then when
*  you go through the Duncan and Kobe career.
*  Like I would just rather have what Duncan was.
*  You know where I stand on that one.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Like when I see these all time lists and people were like, if you're like, I think
*  Arena's had another and he's been on a heater all season.
*  Uh, he wants, I think he said, Brussels Westbrook was the key for who was coming out of the
*  West.
*  Um, he was like, if you don't have Kobe in your top five and I'm thinking like, okay,
*  wait a minute, does that mean Duncan?
*  I think most people would have Kobe ahead of Duncan.
*  So the reason I bring that up is this question to you.
*  Do you think, do you think Yokech is kind of Duncan and Embiid is Kobe in that when
*  Embiid is going physically, it's so much more impressive than anything Yokech does.
*  It's a fair question.
*  To me, the Duncan Kobe thing was pretty obvious the whole time.
*  Like Duncan's teams were always 55 wins, no matter who was on his team.
*  And he wanted, he won a title in 03 with really nobody and beat Shaq and Kobe together.
*  And I don't think he had an all star on that team other than him.
*  I think the problem with this MVP thing is that we just have three awesome choices.
*  Now, Giannis might fade out because he's doing things like he skipped the Saturday night ABC
*  thing.
*  Like if Giannis could have played in that Warriors game yesterday, I know he's a little
*  banged up, but he could have put up 42 and 25 against the Warriors yesterday.
*  And then people would be going today, Oh, is Giannis.
*  You're right.
*  The choices are really hard.
*  I remember I went back.
*  One of the things I did in my book was I was trying to figure out the 1981 MVP race.
*  And this was a different era where everybody kind of would decide who the MVP was halfway
*  through the season and everybody decided it was Julius Irving's MVP.
*  It was time for him to win one.
*  And then something weird happened down the stretch where the Celtics started playing
*  really well and birds started to have some monster games.
*  And it was kind of closer than people realize final game of the season.
*  They're playing in Boston.
*  Celtics beat them.
*  Bird's great.
*  Bird has like five steals in the first quarter and he's just the best part in the four.
*  But Irving won the MVP because it had kind of already been decided.
*  I was like, whatever.
*  Nobody really cared about the MVP the same way back then.
*  I think that's an old way of thinking about the MVP where people would kind of decide
*  around game 60 who was going to win it or what the narrative was.
*  And that was kind of what takes hold.
*  Now people get mad at the narrative, even when nothing has been folded yet.
*  And it's game 63 and people are flipping out and accusing people of already decided of whatever.
*  Jokic was the MVP favorite for the first two thirds of the season.
*  I think Embiid with what he's done in the last month, not only has closed the gap,
*  but I think he's going to pass him.
*  Like I think Embiid or Janis is going to win the MVP because I don't think the West
*  matters as much to the Nuggets or Jokic and I see them fading back.
*  So like on Fandl today Embiid was plus 250.
*  To me, Jokic and Embiid should be even.
*  Because Embiid's on a mission and I got to say as a voter, if it's dead even,
*  and I'm looking at them like, man, should Embiid have one of these?
*  If it's two to one Jokic versus Embiid versus three, oh, like that is going to be a factor
*  this year for people that what maybe it won't be one of the top 10 variables,
*  but it would be something you think about like, hmm, he is kind of do like it.
*  If it's this even and the records are even and everything is even,
*  like if it's this even and the records are even and everything's even, yeah,
*  fuck it. And I think that's why he has a real chance.
*  Yeah, I think you're right. And I think the recency thing, like even with Janis,
*  like I had a moment, I don't know, two weeks ago where I started flirting in that direction,
*  where I was like, I might just do it. You know, he's the best player in the league.
*  They're going to be the one seed in the East. I'd pick them against any other team.
*  Like what do I need to make it this complicated? Like I saw a stat the other day that talked about
*  how and B was on pace for the best scoring per 36 that we've seen since will. And I was like,
*  wait, what? And Janis is actually ahead of that at per 36, but Janis is technically a center.
*  So I was like, okay, that felt a little disingenuous. It's like, we've never seen
*  anybody ever do this before. And it's like, well, we're actually seeing another guy do it.
*  They just have a different letter next to their name when they check in a game. So
*  if there's a lot of it, it'll be funny because everybody thinks all the Yokel stuff was because
*  of advanced metrics, which it wasn't because Embiid was terrific in the same metrics. He was
*  just behind Yokel and a lot of them last year. It would be funny if Janis ended up winning it
*  because the metrics, he doesn't really stand up to the other guys. And it depends on how
*  much importance you put on it. Like, I don't know how many of the hundred voters are like default
*  VORP guys. You know, I think that there's a lot. I just don't think it's 50. I don't know if it's
*  10. I don't know if it's 20. I don't know if it's all wind shares because you start doing that stuff.
*  Like I would never just look at that and go, okay, that's my vote.
*  You know, what's funny about this though is that isn't it good not to have group think,
*  to have people disagree. Like, isn't that the whole point of this? I think everybody complains,
*  especially in the last six years in the country where it's like, oh, everybody is so polarized
*  on these one or two sides. You have to either have to think your side or the other side. And
*  there's no nuance. There's nothing in between. This is the ultimate example of how there should
*  be nuance. And it is way like, like right now we're taping it's, it's 4 33 down Pacific time.
*  The Sixers are up 10 halfway through the third quarter against Washington and it beat us 26
*  points already. Like he's going to have another 40 point game. There was some stat about how he'd had
*  I think 23 35 point games this year. And this, this is looking like this is going to be his 24th.
*  Like he's probably going to end the season with 32 to 35, 35 point games. And I know the stats are
*  weird this year and they've been harder than ever to compare history to now because the offense is
*  so up, but he's having one of the best offensive seasons by a center ever from a scoring standpoint.
*  So he stays on this tear. I think your recency thing, like the reason I didn't get to it,
*  but like if Yonis had gone off on a Saturday ABC game, even against the Warriors team that we can't
*  figure out, you're right. Cause it would have turned into a, Hey, and you have to wonder like,
*  what's the percentage of voters that are actually impressionable enough to see a week of like,
*  is Yonis the guy coverage that actually makes that person think differently about their vote.
*  It's not zero. Again, I know I think the NBA has a really good job.
*  Remember this happened. Westbrook, it was dead even everybody. And then Westbrook had a couple
*  big games. I remember he had one awesome Sunday night game. He had like a comeback win game. And
*  then all of a sudden it was just everybody's like, all right, vote for that guy. And that's the whole
*  point. Like when you have even races like this, it is going to come down to the last couple of weeks
*  and you call it recency bias. But in this case, these guys are really playing for something. The
*  Sixers have a chance to get the two seed now. They might even have a chance to get the one seed.
*  They're just trying to hold on to their one seed and the Bucks are trying to hold on the one seed.
*  So there's real stakes. Got teams are playing head to head. And I think the next, I don't know,
*  I don't think it's rocket science said the next three weeks are going to decide it. And I think
*  that's okay. Yeah. I have no idea. I have no idea what I'm going to do. I think like a lot of people
*  before this in B tear, you were like, yeah, Yoko is probably the favorite. And it felt like the
*  right call. You shouldn't go, I'm not voting for him because I don't want it to be a three in a row.
*  But I don't, yeah, look, man, I can't say it too many times already. I don't know. Yeah, go ahead.
*  What are my MVP questions that, you know, and I read the MVP calm, I would have the four questions
*  and one of them was like, who will you remember first about the season, stuff like that. And one
*  of them is if it's a pickup game and you could take anyone in the league, who's the first pick
*  based on how they're playing this season.
*  I would take Yanis. I would take Yanis too.
*  I might want to play with Yokech more. And then I'd be like, well, who's calling his own fouls. And
*  I think, I think Yanis would call the least amount of his own fouls. I think Yokech might call the
*  most, but if Harden were playing with Embiid in the pickup game, then I'd be like, well, if
*  they're together, then they're calling their own fouls. Like we might as well just pack up.
*  I think I'd be the most afraid. Yeah. If that happens. Did you see the NBA tweeted out Harden's
*  free throw record thing? I, I almost said something that was like, don't just let it go. Yeah. Let it
*  go a week. I will say out of the, in that pickup game question, I think Embiid is the guy in the
*  league now that if he's not taken first, he would take it the most personally and you'd probably be
*  in the most danger, AKA the Kobe Bryant rule. He's like Embiid's like, I went third, like even in
*  the all-star game Embiid fucking tried in the all-star game. Like Yokech could have given a shit,
*  right? He's like, why am I here? This sucks. I hate this. There's nothing, there's nothing from the
*  all-star game I'll ever use to influence. No, I know. But I was like, I'm just saying Embiid, Embiid is always going to
*  going to give some sort of shit about the game he's in where I don't know that meant,
*  I mean, nothing might mean anything. I just feel like- Who would I want to play with though? Yeah. I
*  probably want to play with Yokech because you get shots. But you'd have to make sure you put the
*  right team with them, right? You'd be like, oh, we don't want Jordan Poole with Yokech because now we
*  have a Bonesbury, Bones Highland situation. I almost said Bonesbury. I don't know who Bonesbury is.
