# Why Don’t The Lakers Have A Coach Yet? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIBAo_42EgM)
*  And I was looking at the history of the Lakers since 2012.
*  They've had Mike Brown, Mike D'Antoni, Byron Scott, Luke Walton, Frank Vogel,
*  and Darvin Ham and new coach X as their head coaches.
*  That's seven coaches in 12 years.
*  And it seems like JJ is the leader in the clubhouse.
*  But as you watched the Lakers from afar,
*  do you feel like they have a firm grip on the steering wheel just in general?
*  What's your take?
*  I didn't think it was embarrassing when they made the offer to Hurley and then he turned it down
*  because I saw a lot of that.
*  Now, if you want to look at the whole stretch of it, yes, it does feel a little weird.
*  And it feels like there's just a lot of different information flying out there.
*  Like how does JJ Reddit go from the guy to then the Hurley weekend
*  to then there was a report and sometimes it's just wording.
*  And if somebody has the title three podcasts a week, there'll be times I'm like,
*  I just want to hit send on this thing.
*  And I don't care how this is framed.
*  To say that Reddit now moves to the forefront.
*  When he said one interview.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it was like, so who was ahead of him?
*  It was like, I guess Hurley was.
*  And then where's Borrego in all this?
*  Because I just hope Borrego gets it because he's a great coach.
*  Like I did this whole coaching thing and I wish I had talked about how like
*  when I forced myself to watch a team that doesn't have a great record,
*  like find a coach you like, though, find somebody in this.
*  If you're always mad about people never pointing it out, then you have to do it.
*  Like find somebody in Borrego was always like one of those guys for me.
*  So it's like when it's like when Bill Burr was the comics comic.
*  Yes, it's exactly before he became a huge star.
*  It's like the other comics love Bill Burr.
*  Then it was Shane Gillis is like Shane Gillis.
*  Love that guy.
*  Very good.
*  Strong, strong for a man.
*  So Borrego is the comics comic coaches coach.
*  That's how I see it.
*  It just, I think all of us are living like this fictional version of it.
*  So we don't know.
*  And that's why it seems weird.
*  Does that make any sense?
*  I agree.
*  But what's going to be even weirder is if Cleveland just hires James Borrego tomorrow,
*  because there's not a lot of head coaching candidates left.
*  I mean, part of the reason you hire a coach relatively fast is because every summer there's
*  a certain number of qualified candidates available and then they all get hired.
*  And they've kind of missed the boat on that.
*  I'll tell you another thing.
*  And, you know, we both like JJ and I think he's super smart and I think he really wants
*  to coach.
*  I think he's put a lot of thought into it.
*  If I was the Lakers, I would be super concerned about the NBA first time head coaches with no
*  coaching experience list.
*  Do you want me to rattle this off?
*  Have you looked at this?
*  I do.
*  Yeah.
*  The last one was Steve Nash with the 21 Nets.
*  And I still feel like he should have been a good coach.
*  And maybe he was.
*  Look at his record.
*  It's actually when you look it up, you go, oh my God, he actually did all right.
*  Consider they came within one, what half inch of KDs on the line of beating the bucks.
*  And that's it.
*  No, but I, whenever I look at his winning percentage, he won 58% of his games.
*  Now you can say, okay, well, the team is pretty good.
*  I don't considering what a headache that was for him.
*  I think that's a very easily forgettable number in that.
*  Like, oh, he was bad and they fired him or whatever.
*  When he was hired, people were really pissed about it.
*  Wonder what that was.
*  Derek Fisher in 2014 with the Knicks, which started his incredible cycle of NBA to WNBA
*  to high school basketball in LA over the course of 10 years.
*  He also was paid.
*  I think he had the seventh highest salary out of the jump.
*  Yeah.
*  Steve Kerr with the 2014 warriors.
*  Now this was a no-
*  We don't know.
*  No, but it was a no coaching experience thing.
*  But there's a huge asterisk with this because a, his two coaches were Phil Jackson and Greg
*  Popovich.
*  So he had two of the best four coaches of all time as the only coaches he had for the
*  last three fourths of his career.
*  Then the other thing was he was the Phoenix GM for like four years and was with Alvin
*  Gentry every day.
*  And it was just around a team and that kind of day-to-day decisions, seeing what it takes,
*  seeing all the things that pop up.
*  So even though he had no coaching experience, I almost can't count him because I feel like
*  he did whatever his experience was as GM every day being around the team is something more
*  than not being around a team.
*  Jason Kidd 2013 Nets, Mark Jackson, 2011 Golden State, Vinny Del Negro, 2008 Chicago, Kevin
*  McHale, 2005 Minnesota, Isaiah Thomas, 2000 Indy and Dock Rivers, 1999 Orlando.
*  And then it goes backwards to Larry Bird, ML Carr, Magic Johnson, Quinn Buckner, Dan
*  Issell, one of the Van Arsdale's and Paul Silas.
*  And I mentioned this because there's 18 guys-
*  Which Van Arsdale?
*  Only three of those eight- I can't remember and I'm not going to look it up.
*  Only three of the 18 that I just mentioned reached round two of the playoffs.
*  Steve Kerr, Larry Bird and Steve Nash.
*  10 of the 18 coaches first timers never made the playoffs.
*  The point is, I think it's hard to just step in and coach a team.
*  And I think we're all glossing over that because if somebody's smart, but you know,
*  even you look at the difference of Missoula from last year to this year, it's like night and day.
*  I just wonder if this is harder than we gave it credit for.
*  What are your thoughts?
*  I also think the industry would come up with a string of this.
*  Like NBA coaching right now is chaos.
*  It's a two-year job.
*  Yeah, it's actually- people saw this being debated like, would you even want it?
*  It's like, fuck it, I've never wanted it more.
*  I mean, again, I'm not talking about me, but if you were in that world, I'd be like, all right,
*  so the salaries are making a massive like, hey, the cap goes up spike.
*  The average annual salary in the top end numbers right now for Kerr and Popovich and Spolster and
*  this kind of stuff and the Bonnie Williams number.
*  So you're coming in going, all right, well, I've got to be like eight figures if I have any kind
*  of juice or any kind of leverage.
*  And that's where the Lakers probably screwed up on the Hurley thing is that they really wanted
*  to grab them out of Utah.
*  Did they screw up though?
*  Or did they want them?
*  Did they ever want them in the first place?
*  I don't know.
*  Because that offer wasn't a good enough offer.
*  And they can't, they can't in a million years have thought that he was, that was going to be the
*  offer.
*  And by the way, why didn't he counter?
*  There's a lot of negotiation.
*  And then why did he do this entire day PR tour about the whole offer?
*  I thought, I thought the whole thing start to finish was one of the weirdest stories in the
*  recent history of the league.
*  I still don't know for sure if the Lakers even wanted him as a coach.
*  I don't know how he came out of nowhere.
*  Why wasn't he the name that got mentioned in the beginning of May?
*  Did he ever really want to leave Yukon?
*  Gino or Emma was making jokes about it.
*  I thought Ethan Sherwood Strauss wrote a really good piece about it this weekend.
*  Just in general, it's a rare basketball story where it's over and I'm like, I still don't really
*  know what happened.
*  Were they just trying to leverage JJ, which I espoused to you a week ago when conspiracy bill
*  came in.
*  Were they just trying to leverage JJ to get him to knock his price down by pretending they were
*  interested in somebody else?
*  I don't know.
*  Are they just a mess as an organization?
*  Is it true that it's just Linda and Kurt Rambis and Jeannie Buss?
*  They just like hang out in a porch and figure out what's going to happen with the Lakers?
*  Because I think that might be true.
*  I actually think that might be the Lakers.
*  They let go out to dinner at Craig's and Kurt's like, I'll have the veal chop.
*  And then Jeannie's like, I'll have the salmon.
*  And Linda's like, how's the brand Zeno tonight?
*  And it's like, it's great.
*  And then they're just eating like, what should we do about a coach?
*  What do you think?
*  Brand Zeno has been huge for a couple of years.
*  Brand Zeno is on an incredible two, three year run.
*  Big Brand Zeno decade.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people are saying that.
*  Do you think it's a decade?
*  You know, the moves, the years move fast.
*  It may be a decade, but it feels like just yesterday was like, what?
*  Brand Zeno is in.
*  I think all of that's fair.
*  Seriously, go.
*  I think all of that's fair.
*  The hurly part of it that I think is the funniest thing is he went on with everybody
*  after to explain why any speculation about it was wrong, which I thought was like he had one
*  specific quote where he had said, oh, I thought the silliest take was that this was a leverage play.
*  It was like, no, I'm saying what?
*  What are you talking about?
*  How was it not?
*  Like, why?
*  Why did you point so specific to that?
*  Which I think was a completely reasonable thing, which, by the way, no one would be on your case
*  about. Nobody would.
*  Other than the hardest core Husky fans that wouldn't want you to leave.
*  So I think JJ probably, my guess would be like, can tease the first time guy.
*  They were like, well, that's not like we know what the numbers are for head coaches,
*  but that's not your number.
*  And I would guess that JJ could say, well, yeah, but my number isn't about my lack of
*  Yeah, you have to convince me to take the job.
*  This is what it will take.
*  Right.
*  Because I have a long runway, potentially, depending on what he does in the media.
*  And there's no reason to put a cap on anything for JJ.
*  But what we touched on this already, I think was it last week?
*  Yeah, it was seven days ago when we laid out, we laid out this whole thing.
*  And by the way, it was right.
*  Yeah. So that's, that's what I wonder.
*  Well, but the other funny thing about this, Rossello is so there are two choices here are
*  a head coaching, a head coach with no coaching experience, which is the results are checkered
*  to say the least.
*  You know what else is checkered?
*  Bringing a guy in from college to be a pro coach.
*  That's also a thing that has pretty much never worked with, with a couple of,
*  uh, a couple of zags, Brad Stevens.
*  Donovan's been solid, which you say above average, I'd say above average,
*  but for the most part, it's been a lot of long Kruger, PJ Carlissimo.
*  Um, there's been just been a lot of bad ones.
*  I remember writing about it a million years ago.
*  It's really hard.
*  It's apples and oranges going from college to pros,
*  Patino, Calipari, like a lot.
*  We've watched a lot of people fail.
*  Lon Kruger, Lon Kruger, Freddy Hoyberg.
