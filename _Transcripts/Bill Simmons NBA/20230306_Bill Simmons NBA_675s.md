# Is Joe Mazzulla Struggling to Coach the Celtics? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUT2bk3axiM)
*  Right now Boston's 45 and 20 and the bucks are 46 and 18.
*  I think the bucks are cruising toward it, but it's not inconceivable.
*  It could be one four, one five, Nick Celtics in round two.
*  Look, the Brooklyn game was disgusting.
*  Um, I think, I don't know if he's a bad coach, Joe Missoula.
*  I just know that he's learning on the job as this goes along.
*  And I don't want to coach for a team that has a chance to win the title.
*  That is still favored to win the title.
*  Who's learning on the job.
*  And you saw it today, stuck with the same lineup way too long.
*  Just, just William smart, Horford, Tatum, or Brown.
*  He just wasn't going to waver quickly.
*  He was doing whatever he wanted.
*  They were in the same play over and over again.
*  Derek White, who's the third best player on the team all season, just
*  doesn't play in crunch time, just come to accept that he's not going to play
*  in the last five minutes of these games.
*  But the timeout stuff, you know, which on the one hand is like a total sports
*  radio guy calling into Eddie Andelman in 1979.
*  I don't understand why we're not calling timeouts.
*  On the other hand, it's been really damaging.
*  There's been multiple games this year where the no timeout thing has really
*  hurt them, including today where they had the ball 22 seconds left.
*  They should have called a timeout.
*  They should have put the, put one more shooter out there instead of Grant, who
*  hasn't made a three in about six weeks.
*  And instead they, they just kind of run it along 14 seconds pass.
*  Nobody knows the play.
*  They have to call timeout with eight seconds left.
*  Nick's have a foul to give.
*  Now we're down to six seconds and you end up with the rush corporate three,
*  but it's just little stuff.
*  And if it's two seven Celtics, Miami or Cello, I just think Spolstra is going
*  to look at this like I can out coach this guy and we can win this series, even
*  though we don't have a better team.
*  We can outthink these guys and out strategize them and we can win
*  games in the last two minutes.
*  And I feel like it's headed for two seven because unless Atlanta folds, it
*  doesn't win that division Miami's going to be there six or seven.
*  It looks like Celtics would beat any seven or eight team other than Miami.
*  And I think the Miami thing would be a dogfight, but I just can't believe we're
*  watching the starting back from the Amidoka thing early on in a, what was
*  that August to, Oh, this Joe would know he knows what he's doing.
*  He's going to learn.
*  And now it's, it's March and I don't feel any better about him than I did four
*  months ago.
*  Okay.
*  A lot of stuff there.
*  Let me start with timeouts.
*  Most of us do not know what's going on to the level that these guys do.
*  Almost all of us to talk about this for a living.
*  It's actually one of the weirdest dynamics of all of what we do is the
*  terminology.
*  Hey, actually the help was supposed to be here.
*  Actually this was supposed to happen, but we know about timeouts, right?
*  And so when something doesn't happen and then you have failure, everybody jumps
*  on timeouts cause it's the only thing people are comfortable talking about.
*  All right.
*  And it's like, well, this guy didn't call a timeout and I feel better about
*  myself and we are far more likely to criticize anyone than compliment all the
*  other things that happen and go right the entire time.
*  But when it's this definitive thing of like, Ooh, a timeout wasn't called.
*  Okay.
*  This didn't work.
*  All right.
*  Now I have a four hour radio show and I'm going to talk about timeouts the whole
*  time that play and thank God for JJ Reddick.
*  I love what he's doing on some of these broadcasts.
*  He called it out.
*  I mean, anybody that's ever watched any basketball knows what the horn set is.
*  It's two in the corners.
*  It's two with the elbows and the ball handler has an option of going left or
*  right, and then you can cut off of that on the backside or somebody pops and
*  Jaylen's the only one getting the ball probably off of that action.
*  Grant didn't know that it was horns.
*  That's Grant Williams fault.
*  Okay.
*  Horford once Tatum was waving them.
*  Okay.
*  And then Horford's like looking at him going, dude, what are you doing?
*  I'm also sensing an annoyance with teammates with Grant anyway, which I don't
*  think is any breaking news here because there was a switch that got messed up.
*  Dude, in the next game, it was 34 seconds left.
*  The game was over and Grant's screaming for a challenge.
*  So the finger wave for every challenge.
*  She just loves challenges.
*  Josh Hart made fun of him.
*  Like he pushed her like some of the rebound fouls are really tough, but I
*  think it evens out of the course of the game and there was the foul where heart
*  got it and then heart actually made a grant Williams face.
*  It was like making fun of him his arms out.
*  So I, there's two things, maybe you're right.
*  I don't know that Spoh has like, suppose better than everybody.
*  Do you really think that Miami team is going to win four out of seven
*  with that offense against Boston?
*  I don't know.
*  Well, you just, you were there in person on Friday night watching the Celtics just
*  fold for an hour.
*  I'm more on play.
*  I look, when it comes to basketball, I'm way more on the players being the reason
*  you win and lose than I am the coaches.
*  And I don't think you like any coaches.
*  When's the last boss of Celtics coach you thought was good?
*  Casey Jones.
*  I thought he may was good last year.
*  I liked him.
*  You didn't for a while.
*  You didn't for a while.
*  I did for a couple of months that I talked myself into him.
*  I, I, so I would go the other way on the no timeout thing.
*  At least on the grant play, you call timeout or allows you to take grant out of the game.
*  He can't make threes anywhere.
*  Why is he out there?
*  I mean, I don't know how many minutes he played tonight.
*  40 minutes.
*  Okay.
*  But if, if we're getting in a lineup thing and I agree like Derek White's been
*  incredible, you can't sit smart, even though smart couldn't make anything until
*  he hit actually, you know, two big threes.
*  Just stop what you said there.
*  You can't sit smart.
*  Why?
*  Derek White's better than smart this season.
*  I just don't think you're going to do that to the team.
*  I think that would be a really tough move to pull, um, to a team that did what
*  they did last year and smart, I think having probably the best season I've ever
*  had, just the way he played, controlled the game, wasn't trying to do too much.
*  Like a subdued smart offensively is what we all want.
*  I actually thought he did a lot of really nice things tonight.
*  Uh, for you think physically he looks a hundred percent to you.
*  No, I don't.
*  No, I don't.
*  I think the numbers, I think the numbers are, I think the numbers are, I think
*  the numbers are meh, you know, and I think there's other times where the numbers
*  probably look better than he's actually played, but I thought he busted his
*  ass tonight defensively.
*  I, one of my favorite plays that play where he forced the turnover and it was
*  a scrum along the sideline or actually just thought it was off the Knicks player
*  and quickly wanted to review when his back was to it.
*  That was my favorite demand to review quickly.
*  I didn't even see what happened behind him.
*  But, um, the other thing is with Mitchell and Randall, I don't think they could
*  afford to take Grant out and have Horford be your only size.
*  I don't think you were going to get any rebounds with no Rob.
*  That's just me.
*  You know, I don't know.
*  I would have gone smaller personally.
*  Okay.
*  Maybe you're right.
*  Maybe you're right.
*  I just, I didn't, I didn't like Grant in that game and I thought over and over
*  again, their goal was just to get quickly switched on him because he was going by
*  him every time and if that's happening quickly at the game of his life today, at
*  some point you got to change it up and try different things.
*  I just really, really worry about teams that just over and over again, the same
*  thing happens, right?
*  Like we'll talk about the Warriors later.
*  The Warriors are in a different situation where they just fall behind a lot.
*  And at some point you kind of are who you are just over and over again.
*  You're scrapping from we're down like the, what are the words of the road down?
*  Seven and 24.
*  Like that's not a sample size anymore.
*  They suck on the road for whatever reason.
*  And the Celtics over and over again, have this tendency that did it today in
*  this Dicks game, they have a lead and they just blow it like in two minutes.
*  And I don't know that the one thing with white that I think he does for them, at
*  least offensively is he pushes the pace and he can get to the basket.
*  And I don't think smart gets to the basket in the same way.
*  Now, if you, they posted up smart a couple of times in the game today against
*  quick cause quickly is like 150 pounds.
*  And when they did that, the next were like, Oh shit, they're not going to keep
*  doing that, are they like that?
*  And then of course we stopped doing that again so we could get to Brown or Tatum.
*  Just jacking up shots.
*  It was awesome.
*  Brown was awesome tonight.
*  All right.
*  Brown gave, I love Jaylen Brown tonight.
*  Tatum's final, final numbers are good, but the shooting line was bad.
*  The second F yeah.
*  Brown finished 12 for 25.
*  Tatum was 12 for 30 and, uh, and both of them played high forties in the minutes.
*  The Josh Hart thing is real though.
*  If you're a Knicks fan and you're watching that and like Tatum had a really
*  hard time with them and then they, there was two plays in particular where they
*  ran a switch when they finally got to switch and they didn't get the ball back
*  to Tatum and then the play that drove me crazy, I think it was the end of the
*  first overtime where Brown had it.
*  And then this is something I just harp on all the time.
*  It's like, people are so switch happy.
*  And I get that part of the forcing a switch isn't so much the one-on-one matchup.
*  It's forcing a team to make a decision and getting guys moving.
*  Um, I'd say it's to get a mismatch in the post, but nobody throws it to
*  anybody in the post anymore.
*  Phoenix tried it twice today with eight and late in the game and they're like,
*  all right, we're not doing that again.
*  It's like, yeah, no shit.
*  That's why you guys don't do it.
*  So I don't think anybody ever other than Embiid will be like, okay, let's get a
*  post touch here to do something different.
*  But the Celtics and I would put this more on the players is like, why are you
*  running a switch where now Brown ends up with heart?
*  Like that's the opposite of what you wanted.
*  We try to get him off of Tatum and that you're the ball handler up top.
*  Granted Tatum had that kind of layup thing, but it was just so rushed cause it
*  was like three seconds with the ball left.
*  So I love what Brown did tonight.
*  Grant Williams, 44 minutes, two for seven, one for five from three, six
*  rebounds, 44 minutes.
*  And then defensively they kept putting them in those switches.
*  I just, I don't get the lineups.
*  And I, the, the thing that really scares me about the Celtics for the spring is
*  that I don't know who they think the best five band lineup is, but it's always
*  these lineups with size, which I think slows them down and I don't like when
*  they play slower.
*  Um, and I'm worried about like Milwaukee.
*  You saw them have, and I want to talk about that Milwaukee field game, but you
*  saw them have trouble with that weird lineup that Philly had cause PJ Tucker
*  was hurt and Harris was hurt and all of a sudden Philly had that goofy lineup.
*  They put up 48 points.
*  Milwaukee is a little bit bigger.
*  Like they, they just had trouble matching up with it.
*  And that's what I'm not seeing from the Celtics team.
*  I'm not seeing like innovation during games where it's like, Oh, let me try
*  this, let me see if this works.
*  Let me see.
*  Let me, let me try it.
*  Let me go a little smaller.
*  Let me, I just don't see it.
*  And I've been watching all season.
*  I've been waiting for the light bulb to go off and I just don't feel like
*  this team is well-coached.
*  I don't think they're badly coached, but I don't think they're well-coached.
*  Okay.
*  But he did have less options tonight.
*  You know, you don't have Brogdon who, you know, some people would have six
*  men of the year, although I think quickly is going to get a massive bump now.
*  I think so.
*  What happened?
*  Um, so, you know, as soon as you start saying that you didn't have Rob Williams
*  or you didn't have Brogdon, I mean, you didn't have Brunson who's been the best
*  player this season for that team.
*  So it's not really a good excuse.
*  So is it more surprising when you don't have Rob Williams or when you do?
*  Uh, I mean, I think it's surprising when you have them for a long stretch,
*  like the starting five that they want to have with Horford Williams, Tatum,
*  Brown and Smart hasn't played much.
*  My dad texted me during the game the other night and he was like, Rob, just,
*  Rob just went to the locker room.
*  Go figure.
*  So he just, I think durability is a skill, which we've talked about before.
*  And Rob can't stay in the court and I don't know what it is, but just over and
*  over again, isn't able to do it.
