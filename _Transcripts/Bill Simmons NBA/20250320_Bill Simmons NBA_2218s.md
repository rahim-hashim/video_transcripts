# The Celtics Sell for 6.1 Billion (a new record!) … What’s Next? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo)
*  Chris Manix is here. You can read him on Sports Illustrated. You can listen to his podcast. What's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=0.0s)]
*  the podcast called? Open Floor still? Open Floor. Yeah. Open Floor. Was that, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=5.36s)]
*  where was that on the title list as you were coming up with title names? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=10.08s)]
*  The top one or like two taken? Yeah. Titles are so hard now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=13.68s)]
*  Yeah. I think this was back like, I started that podcast before I left for Yahoo. So like, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=18.56s)]
*  it was back then. Let's just call it basketball or something like that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=23.52s)]
*  They're like, no, gotta keep going. Speaking of basketball, an eight episode HBO drama could be [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=27.52s)]
*  written about the Celtic sale where we found out today, $6.1 million to somebody that, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=33.2s)]
*  12 hours ago, nobody knew who he was. I mean, probably some rich people knew who he was. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=41.2s)]
*  People knew he was the final bidder, but now Bill Chisholm is going to be the next owner [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  of the Boston Celtics. He paid a record price. It was not an accident where Washington, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  the commanders went for 6.05. Celtics go for 6.1. I have a million thoughts, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=56.88s)]
*  but what was your immediate reaction to the price? Astonished. I didn't believe they would get over [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  six. Look, that's a record. That's a huge number regardless, but the fact that you're just selling [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=71.84s)]
*  the team and you're not selling an arena, that is a huge variable in all this. When Matt Ishby bought [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=80.72s)]
*  Phoenix for a 4 billion valuation, he was getting the arena with it. He was getting, whatever it's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=89.12s)]
*  worth, a WNBA team with it. You're just getting the Boston Celtics here. Yeah, it's an iconic [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=95.52s)]
*  franchise, but it's a franchise that costs a lot of money, is set to have the highest payroll ever [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=102.0s)]
*  next year. You're taking on something with a lot of bills. I guess my first reaction was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=111.36s)]
*  bravo to H. Irving Grousbeck and the lawyers that he hired to sell this team because [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=118.16s)]
*  I really believe that he got the absolute maximum value that is possible to extract from the Celtics [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=126.0s)]
*  at this point. That was my first reaction. Wow, they got a price that I didn't believe they were [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=134.4s)]
*  going to get. My first reaction, because I love being right, was I was saying last summer that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=140.32s)]
*  this was going to get to six and that's what the NBA wanted. Guess what? It got to six. I think [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=145.76s)]
*  that was a huge thing for the NBA with the expansion coming. Six has to be the number. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=150.32s)]
*  That's what we want. I think it was a big thing for the family, especially Irv, the 90-year-old [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=155.92s)]
*  legend, who was not going to have any sort of inside job. There's a whole Steve Pagliuca who's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=161.6s)]
*  the number two owner of the Celtics right now that everybody assumed he was going to get it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=168.64s)]
*  I can't wait to dive into that piece with you. It was made clear from the beginning. There's no [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=172.48s)]
*  inside job. This will go to the highest bidder. The most money wins this. Nobody really believed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=177.76s)]
*  it, but that's how it played out. It got to six-one. My guess is that the Pagliuca group, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  and maybe even one or two of the other ones, got to the six. The point one is so fascinating to me. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  The point one, sometimes this is how it goes. This is how Larry Ellison lost the Warriors. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=196.32s)]
*  Where it's like, no, he had it, he had it, he had it. Then the other side, I think, went to, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=202.64s)]
*  I forget what it was, like 400, 360, whatever it was. He's like, nope, that's my final offer. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=207.04s)]
*  He didn't get it. Over and over again, the guys that get these teams are the ones that are like, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  you want to break the Washington record? All right. All right, point one, done. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  And that was it. That's how he got it. The Steve Pagliuca piece is incredible [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=222.8s)]
*  that he didn't get it and that he came really close. He did a long post today that was posted [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=227.44s)]
*  on social media. That was, I think, one of the strangest posts I've ever read from [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=232.32s)]
*  somebody who didn't own a team. I couldn't believe he did that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=238.4s)]
*  I would call that corporate scorched earth. It's not scorched earth like Dan Gilbert on LeBron, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=243.84s)]
*  but it's corporate scorched earth. I thought the most telling part of that was a five paragraph [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=251.12s)]
*  statement that he released. Was at the very end of, I think it was the first paragraph, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=258.96s)]
*  where he noted that he had put together a group of investors that were eager to continue to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=264.08s)]
*  reinvest in the team. I think the last sentence was luxury tax be damned. What Steve Pagliuca [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  is doing there is he is planting the seed to be on the other side of future Celtic fan outrage. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=278.56s)]
*  Because we all know there are some tough decisions that this ownership group is going to have to make [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=287.12s)]
*  in the next couple of years. Sam Houser makes $10 million right now. In real dollars though, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=291.04s)]
*  that's like 80 million he's making, he's costing this team. There are decisions [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  that they're going to have to make. What Steve Pagliuca, in my mind, did with that statement [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=301.6s)]
*  was just put himself in a position where if this team does cut some corners over the next couple [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=306.24s)]
*  of years, lop off some salaries, he can sit there and be like, you know what? I would have done that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=311.52s)]
*  I put together a group of guys that weren't going to do that. He set himself up. We can get into the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  dynamics there of that ownership group. Oh, we're doing it right now. This is the number one thing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=321.6s)]
*  I want to talk about. Go ahead. Well, it's just, so you have these two guys, Wick's dad puts up the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=326.16s)]
*  most money for the team. Wick's the one that's organizing the group. It starts out, I think, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=331.6s)]
*  with four people that put up the money. They get the price and then their job after they get the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=335.92s)]
*  price is to then go find a group of minority people to then take off, offload some of the money they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=341.44s)]
*  just committed to. Which by the way, that's what Chisholm's doing right now. He's trying to, he is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=348.32s)]
*  now, he's already put the feelers out. He's trying to put together a little syndicate to offload some [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  of the money that he's already promised. So that's in motion now. So they get the four, but Pag's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=360.0s)]
*  was always, it was like Wick and he's the owner and the dad put up the most money, but also here's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=365.84s)]
*  Pag's and they've had this uneasy co-owner alliance, but Wick was always the face of it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=370.64s)]
*  And it was always a little awkward and you could feel it when there was like a trophy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=376.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, that's when that Lazarie and Edens had that too. Some of these co-owner like [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  Goober and Lake of same thing where it's like, it's my team, but you have to be here and you hold, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=384.32s)]
*  let's hold the trophy together. And it's always super awkward. And I don't know how great it was [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  going by the end, because I think when, when Pagliuca tried to buy the nets and I don't, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=394.8s)]
*  I don't think Wick found out from Pagliuca is my understanding. And I don't think it's been great [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=401.68s)]
*  since then. And I think the reverse of that was Pagliuca found out that the Celtics were being [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=406.48s)]
*  sold the same way we all did. It was, it was, he was not tipped. He was not giving a heads up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  So I don't think that relationship has been great for the last year. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=419.44s)]
*  And this specifically, the way he reacted to the sale tells me that this is, this is going to get [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=423.2s)]
*  ugly. And I have some reasons for why this got bad near the end, but what else have you heard on this? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=429.2s)]
*  It's I've seen it unfold over the last 20 years and you can unequivocally say it was a lot stronger [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=434.48s)]
*  at the beginning than it was at the end. Yeah. And some of that has everything to do with what [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=443.76s)]
*  you said there. Like Pagliuca is in this kind of with his own cash to what, I don't know what the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=448.88s)]
*  final percentages that he owned of this group. I heard heard around eight or 9%, something in that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=453.92s)]
*  ballpark. And he's looking at Wick Grousbeck who owns a lesser percent of the team, but is a fact, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=458.4s)]
*  effectively H. Irving in all of this. Like he is the money guy. He gets to be the face of it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=465.28s)]
*  And you're right. There, there have been some moments over the last six, seven years as this [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=470.56s)]
*  team has ascended into conference finals, NBA finals, ultimately championships where, you know, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=475.68s)]
*  they're not exactly pulling the trophy kind of away from each other, but you can see some of that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=481.52s)]
*  tension between those two guys. And look, I, I don't know about you, but I had been hearing for [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=486.16s)]
*  months now that, you know, through Pagliuca, it's kind of telegraphing this to people in the NBA, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=491.92s)]
*  that he believed he was going to get it. Like it eventually was going to play out that he was going [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=497.04s)]
*  to get control of this team. It might take a little bit, a little bit longer than people expected, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=500.48s)]
*  but he was ultimately going to grab control of this team. And you can just tell from that statement [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=505.44s)]
*  that he's furious, that he is completely bullshit right now, that he is not going to be the majority [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=510.4s)]
*  owner of the Celtics. Well, so I think he, from what I had heard, that he had the money to get to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=516.48s)]
*  five, which was where they were hoping it was going to be in the fives. Cause that's a realistic [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=523.2s)]
*  price for a franchise that doesn't have an arena. Yeah. The Grousbeck side wanted more, they wanted [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=526.64s)]
*  more, they're pushing the number up. And I think one of the ways this really went sideways, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=533.04s)]
*  there was, there was a moment in this process where stuff was getting leaked out about the sale. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  And there was an unflattering piece about, you know, that it came out and I don't even know what [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=543.92s)]
*  Wicks exact stake is, but how small Wicks stake allegedly was with the Celtics and they're shooting [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=548.56s)]
*  too high. And there was stuff. And I don't think that went great for Paggs and whether whatever [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=554.0s)]
*  he may have done or not done. And he, maybe he did nothing, but I think there was a feeling [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=560.72s)]
*  that somebody was trying to neg the price and make it lower to try to make it. And I think [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  you look at 90 year old Irv Grousbeck, who's like one of the great business people, the last, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  like really respected, respected as a thinker and he's tutored a bunch of people and he's a mentor [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=578.72s)]
*  to a lot of people. And he's just, he's rich for a reason. And I don't think it went over very well. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=583.52s)]
*  That stuff started coming out that they wanted too much for the team. Cause ultimately who's [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=588.64s)]
*  saying that it's either it's like the Fenway group, who I don't think ever was going to try [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=592.72s)]
*  to do it anyway, or somebody that was already actively trying to buy the team. And there [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=596.56s)]
*  weren't a lot of people at that point. So I think from the moment that happened, when those stories [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=599.52s)]
*  came out, it started to get dicey. And there's a lot of people in the organization who are rooting [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=603.84s)]
*  for him to get it because he was stability. It's like, if he comes in, everything will remain the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=608.64s)]
*  same. And I think when that happened, people started getting nervous. I would say to Bill, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=613.2s)]
*  there were people rooting for him to get it. I do think they were. I was kind of rooting for him [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=617.84s)]
*  too, because I wanted things to stay somewhat the same. I do think there were also people [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=623.04s)]
*  rooting for him not to get it though. I think there was a faction there that didn't want to get [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=630.48s)]
*  it in part because all the stuff he's saying now, and I'm sure he would have said it once he, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=635.6s)]
*  if he had gotten control of the team. I'm not sure everybody believes him. I don't know that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=641.76s)]
*  everybody believes that he would be the guy to just pour money into this team to keep it a [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=645.12s)]
*  championship contender throughout the Tate and Brown era. They just didn't believe him. He's [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=651.6s)]
*  got allies within the organization, but I think he also has people that are not as fond of him [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=656.72s)]
*  inside the organization. So I think it was kind of a mixed bag there. I also don't necessarily know, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=661.6s)]
*  because even though there was kind of a whittled down list of finalists, there were a lot of people [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=667.44s)]
*  trying to buy this team and trying to get into the mix for this team. There were a lot of people, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=672.16s)]
*  and I heard this through the NBA, and the NBA stayed connected to the sale process. I was hearing [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=676.48s)]
*  through those sources that people were kind of grumbling over, how are you asking for this when [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=681.52s)]
*  you're not giving us an arena? It's just the team and all the money we have to spend. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=686.0s)]
*  There were a lot of people frustrated with the price. I think it's just as likely that some of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=689.92s)]
*  that stuff about WIC leaked out from someone not named Steve Pagliuca as it was that it was passed. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=695.68s)]
*  That's why we don't know how it leaked out or what happened, but I think once it happened, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=701.44s)]
*  it changed the tenor of this whole thing, where they were like, okay, fuck all you people. Now [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=706.32s)]
*  we're going to get the price we want. You mentioned there were a lot of people kicking the tires on it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  It was double figures. It got whittled down to five. Laurie was in it, the Eagles owner, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  and then for whatever reason dropped out right after the Super Bowl or before the Super Bowl, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=722.8800000000001s)]
*  right around the Super Bowl. I think it was after, who knows, but it went from five to four. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=727.84s)]
*  Chisholm was the mystery guy to me. Even if you were Googling him today, there just isn't a lot [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=735.2s)]
*  of information about him. He grew up on the North Shore, went to Dartmouth. His son plays [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=740.32s)]
*  soccer at Dartmouth and graduated in 19. He's on this weird tech fun, hedge fun thing, and he's [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=746.08s)]
*  apparently a huge Celtics fan. That's all we know, but this is why it's so amazing when somebody [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  buys a team like the Celtics. You go from, I could walk by you and have no idea who you are, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=756.56s)]
*  to now you're one of the kings of Boston. I think Wicks had a really hard time with that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=761.5999999999999s)]
*  over the last year, knowing that there's some end game where when you're the owner of the Celtics, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=767.4399999999999s)]
*  the room treats you a little differently than when you're not. I think he's aware of that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  Which leads into this idea that he's going to be the governor of this team for the next three [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=778.2399999999999s)]
*  years, which I believe is going to be the case because I believe it's going to be codified in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=784.0s)]
*  the sale agreement. This is not going to be whatever handshake deal Mark Cuban had with [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=787.52s)]
*  Patrick Dumont and the Adelson family. I think he's going to have a wedding. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=793.84s)]
*  Did he have any deal? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=796.48s)]
*  No, he didn't have any deal there. That's what the problem was. Cuban went into the sale thinking, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=798.32s)]
*  all right, well, they're going to let me do this. All of a sudden, very quickly, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=802.0s)]
*  it was determined that he wasn't. I do think even if it's nominal, we're going to get with Groszbek [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=805.84s)]
*  while the front facing owners of this team for the next three years. Now, I think there are going to [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=811.3599999999999s)]
*  be problems with that because if you're the guy footing the bill for the franchise, you're not [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=815.3599999999999s)]
*  going to have key decisions being made by someone that's got one foot out the door. I think that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=820.4799999999999s)]
*  there are certainly potential problems with that. But I think, look, Wick, all along, I've thought [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=826.24s)]
*  that Wick wanted to have his cake and eat it too. He would not be selling this team if he wasn't [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=830.4799999999999s)]
*  being forced to by his family. But because he was being forced to, he wanted to make sure that [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=835.12s)]
*  there was top dollar involved in the return and that he would get to hold on to his place atop of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=842.32s)]
*  the totem pole as long as humanly possible. It sure looks like right now that's what he's going [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=848.08s)]
*  to get. I had some people texting me today basically saying, don't be surprised if you see Wick [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=853.2s)]
*  take some of the money that he's going to get off this and try to get back into the ownership group [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=858.64s)]
*  as a minority owner. And have a smaller slice of it to stay kind of connected to this team. So [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=863.28s)]
*  I don't think, look, he's not going to be running the team forever, but I don't think Wick Grosbeck [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=868.24s)]
*  is going anywhere anytime soon. So his statement, and it was funny because they released this [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=872.24s)]
*  statement from Boston Business Partners, which is the group that owns the team. Wick's the first [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=876.88s)]
*  quote in it. And he says that Chisholm asked me to run the team as CEO and governor for the first [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  three years and stay on as his partner. Stay on as his partner. And I'm glad to do so. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=889.36s)]
*  And then the next paragraph is a quote from Chisholm. I've never seen somebody buy a team [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=897.84s)]
*  and not be the first quote in the press release. Everybody was saying Wick was trying to do this, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=902.08s)]
*  and it seems like he actually pulled it off. And you mentioned the Cuban piece. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=908.24s)]
*  I never believed that as it was happening, it seemed inconceivable to me that somebody was [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=913.44s)]
*  going to buy a sports team and then just let somebody who didn't know. We just don't see that [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=917.36s)]
*  really happen ever. And the times we've seen it happen were like Pat Croce and the Sixers. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=923.52s)]
*  You'd be the government and then it would always go badly within a year. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  So it says three years. It doesn't mean it's going to be three years. So if I gave you like [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=932.16s)]
*  the Fandel over under and I gave you the two and a half, like boxing two and a half rounds, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=938.64s)]
*  would you go over under? If you gave me two and a half for the over under, I don't know what I'd bet. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=944.16s)]
*  I go under. I go under. I just think there's too many big decisions that are made by a team governor. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=949.2s)]
*  I think Chisholm and his ownership group is going to want to be the ones making that decision. Now, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=958.88s)]
*  maybe there's synergy between the two. Maybe there's no space between them, no room for daylight. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=964.88s)]
*  They're all in lockstep. But the second they disagree on something, it's going to be Chisholm [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=970.48s)]
*  that says, it's my team. Do what you want. You want to stay in this capacity as a front facing [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=974.72s)]
*  owner, as the governor of the team. Fine. But we're doing things my way. And I don't blame him. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=979.52s)]
*  You're putting up a valuation of six billion dollars. Of course he should have that. Absolutely. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=984.72s)]
*  So it's Chisholm. Chisholm. Okay. No, I don't know. How were you saying it? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=990.64s)]
*  I've been saying it. We know so little about this guy. I don't even know how to pronounce his name. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=996.16s)]
*  Well, this is the thing. I'm kind of saying it in a Massachusetts way though. We both kind of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=999.28s)]
*  are there. If I see that name, I call him Chisholm. Can he put a social media thing on and be like, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1003.76s)]
*  here's how to pronounce my name. Please call me Bill. I refuse to believe his name's William. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1008.4s)]
*  It's got to be Bill. His son's name's Will, which tells me he's a Bill. So here's one of the many [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1012.8s)]
*  things that I don't get about this. For that kind of price. And you're not going to quote unquote, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1018.72s)]
*  be the governor for the first three years. I mean, now he's in his mid fifties. He graduated [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1025.92s)]
*  from Dartmouth in 91. So he's in, this is prime NBA owner, NFL owner range, like from mid fifties, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1030.0800000000002s)]
*  all the way through to mid seventies, a 20 year run. He's got the son. I have no idea if the son's [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1036.5600000000002s)]
*  going to be groomed to have a role with PAG Luca. His son, I think would have been a big part of it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1041.04s)]
*  We'll see with this same thing with if Lori had gotten it, I think his son would have been a big [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1045.44s)]
*  part of it. Um, I just find it hard to believe you're going to buy this team, do the victory lap, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1049.36s)]
*  do the press conference, figure out where your tickets are, have these huge decisions like, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1057.04s)]
*  Oh my God, if we get bounced in round two of the playoffs, we're losing a shitload of money on top [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1063.4399999999998s)]
*  of this $200 million luxury tax bill that's coming. Let me just turn over all the decision-making to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1069.1999999999998s)]
*  WIC. That seems crazy. And we haven't really seen it happen in anything else. So I'm like you, I'm, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1074.32s)]
*  I'm watching it. I'm skeptical. Um, you just, this again, there's too many [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1082.0s)]
*  personnel decisions, financial decisions to just fork over to somebody that's eventually going to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  sell you the rest of the team or whatever it is in a period of time. Um, I think, I think it can [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1097.76s)]
*  last for a year, a year and a half, maybe two years, but eventually something's going to come up [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1104.64s)]
*  to cause fissures between these two sides. There's just too much money at stake for, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1112.08s)]
*  for me to believe that it's, it's going to be this lasting fruitful relationship. Now I do think [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1119.12s)]
*  though, Bill, like I don't know that the new ownership group really had much of a choice with [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1124.0s)]
*  all this. Like I think it was presented this way, like, all right, we'll say the team, but you got [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1130.0s)]
*  to take all this with you. Like if you don't take this, we'll go to option B. We have other offers on [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1134.64s)]
*  the table. Like you saw, it was the globe story back in January, this four finalists, like there [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1140.0s)]
*  were people that wanted this team. And I'm sure that, that WIC leveraged that and used that to [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1144.8s)]
*  his advantage. So, all right, if you want to buy this team, you're going to put up the $6.1 billion [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1151.68s)]
*  valuation, but you're also an agree to X, Y, and Z. And that's, I think that's what they were kind [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1155.28s)]
*  of forced to stomach in order to gain control of this team. So some of the questions that are left [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1160.24s)]
*  is, was this the highest offer? I'm going to assume it was, had to be, but he's doing a lot of debt and [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1165.52s)]
*  all this stuff to, to where it's like, cause I thought it was notable. Pat Glucka said in this [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1173.04s)]
*  thing, we had a real offer. He sounded like a guy who didn't get the house he thought he was going [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1178.48s)]
*  to get. It's like, I had a real offer. I offered you all cash. I don't understand why he went with [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1183.04s)]
*  this other person. They didn't offer you all cash. I don't understand the WIC part at all. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1186.48s)]
*  And there's another piece of this too. And I'm sure you've, you've been around the team a lot. Like [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1193.52s)]
*  he, he's pretty devastated that they're selling in the first place. And he's talked, he's talked [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1199.92s)]
*  about it pretty openly to people that ask him about it. And it's been a theme that has been [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1205.68s)]
*  going around the last couple of months that his, his dad pushed for this. His dad wanted to do it [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1210.96s)]
*  for the estate planning, all the stuff they said. But I think especially with winning the title last [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1215.44s)]
*  year, the team being really good this year, I think WIC's had a really hard time with this, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  even harder than maybe he's led on publicly. So just staying on now for two more years, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1226.96s)]
*  but knowing that there's an end game, it's, it's a really weird variable. I'm excited because he's a [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1232.88s)]
*  great owner and I hope he stays on and has the same impact he had, but it's, it's weird. I feel bad. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1237.8400000000001s)]
*  It's weird to feel bad for somebody who just sold something for $6.1 billion, but I just don't think [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1243.5200000000002s)]
*  he wanted to sell. I don't. He absolutely did not want to sell. This was his father, and we've covered [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1248.3200000000002s)]
*  this ad nauseum, but like his father, you know, recognizing his own mortality and figuring it's [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1255.0400000000002s)]
*  better to get your affairs in order with cash and not with the Boston Celtics. Like that's, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1259.84s)]
*  that's why I wonder if over the next couple of years that WIC would come to appreciate the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1265.1999999999998s)]
*  foresight of his father here. Like I think he's getting out at exactly the right time. Like think [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1272.8799999999999s)]
*  about what you accomplished in the 23 years you owned the Boston Celtics. You won two championships, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1277.28s)]
*  you put together two kind of mini dynasties. You know, the one from the [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1283.52s)]
*  08 to 2012, whatever it was there, it didn't achieve as much as it probably could have achieved [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1288.24s)]
*  if guys had stayed healthy, but you got that group together. You won a championship. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1292.96s)]
*  You pulled off the greatest draft trade in whatever history by dealing all those picks and [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1297.36s)]
*  or getting all those picks from the nets. And you rebuild the team that's been in two finals in [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1303.36s)]
*  three years and is well positioned to win another championship. Like you have, you got an A plus for [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1307.36s)]
*  ownership and not only do you- And you stuck with Tatum and Brown. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1313.28s)]
*  And you stuck with Tatum and Brown. And you became the best owner in Boston by 2025, hands down. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  Imagine if like John Henry had sold the team like 10 years ago. Like what would we be thinking about [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1321.52s)]
*  John Henry now? Rather than stick around and watch this team slowly deteriorate, which it's going to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1326.9599999999998s)]
*  eventually, right? Like maybe it takes three years, maybe it takes five years, but it's eventually [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1335.12s)]
*  going to deteriorate to the point where we're looking at them like we're looking at Milwaukee. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1338.4799999999998s)]
*  I was feeling good. What the hell? We're going to be looking at them like we're [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1342.6399999999999s)]
*  looking at Milwaukee though at some point, right? Like because they're just going to be so, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1345.52s)]
*  you know, financially stretched that they've got to peel off some of these pieces and they're not [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1349.1999999999998s)]
*  going to be as good as they are right now. If you're with Grosbeck, like you went out on top [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1352.6399999999999s)]
*  and not only did you go out on top, you got the greatest exit strategy one could possibly have, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1356.3999999999999s)]
*  which in the form of $6 billion, you can take your cut of and do something else. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1360.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you've proven you are a great NBA owner. You accomplished it. You can go on. You're still [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1364.56s)]
*  relatively young. I mean, you can go on and do the next thing if you really wanted to in professional [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1369.9199999999998s)]
*  sports. Yeah, I would say he was one of the most successful sports owners of this century. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1374.8s)]
*  I'd agree. He took a team that was, had really no assets other than Pierce and no cap space and [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1380.56s)]
*  was able to rebuild it. It's the, the pegs piece of it. He didn't get the nets. Well, he didn't get [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1388.32s)]
*  the nets. He ran for governor, didn't get that. And then everyone thought he was getting the Celtics [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1396.8s)]
*  and he didn't get that. He has the Italian soccer team, but I just, he's got to be dying today. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1402.0s)]
*  Just dying. But I think we all felt like this was probably coming. Like I had hit a point where I [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1407.92s)]
*  didn't, I wouldn't have bet on him. And I think a lot of people, but the thing that I'm going to be [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1414.08s)]
*  interested to see if it floats out over the next couple of days is did he have any chance was had [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1419.76s)]
*  this turned into a situation where they were like, we're just not selling to this guy. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1425.84s)]
*  That's the next story is, you know, we, the next story to figure out. Right. We, we talked about [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1429.84s)]
*  kind of relationship between Wick and Pags is not what it once was. Like how strained have that [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1436.08s)]
*  relationship become? Had it reached a toxic level to the point where Wick Rousbeck was never going [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1442.24s)]
*  to be interested in selling the team to Peg Liuka because that, I don't know, man, you don't release [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1448.08s)]
*  a statement like that unless you're really livid at how the whole thing played out. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1452.4s)]
*  Well, and he released a statement right after they put the team for sale, right? He got one up that [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1458.0s)]
*  day too, Peg Liuka. That day. I'm in. He was the first one to get in to all that. He, he made it [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1462.16s)]
*  clear from jump that he wanted to be the guy that bought this team and took over its stewardship and [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1466.96s)]
*  second. And within minutes after it being announced as being sold, he had a much stronger statement [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1472.16s)]
*  that went out there. Yeah. I think that that's the next thing to figure out is like, was this just [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1477.28s)]
*  about money? Like the fact that South this would get a record $6.1 billion price and Hey, if you [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1481.8400000000001s)]
*  can't meet it, you can't meet it. Or was there more to it? Was there, was the relationship between [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  Wick and Pags something that affected the sale of the team? I would say yes. There's another piece [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  of this expansion coming. That's now we've established a price, 6 billion, if you want in [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1497.84s)]
*  12 billion teams split it 30 ways. That's $400 million in cash. The owners get the, they don't [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1504.0s)]
*  share with the players. So Chisholm is buying in here at 6.1. He knows he's getting 400 billion back [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1509.36s)]
*  over the next couple of years with this expansion fee. So it's really five, seven, cause that's what, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1517.4399999999998s)]
*  you know, that's what Cuban forfeited. That's what the gross specs forfeited by selling now. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1522.8s)]
*  You get that money that maybe goes to luxury tax. I was trying to walk my dad off the ledge this [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1527.84s)]
*  morning. Cause my dad's just like, the Luca thing has spooked my dad. He was like, you can't say like [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1531.6s)]
*  the new Dallas owners, everything seemed great. And then they're trading Luca Dodge for a day [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1538.3999999999999s)]
*  in a first and Max Christie. Like, yeah, I'm worried we're going to do something stupid now. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1543.4399999999998s)]
*  I knew what we had with Wick and it's hard to talk someone off the ledge on that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1547.52s)]
*  I'm more worried though. Worry is the wrong word. Like this year is going to play out [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1553.36s)]
*  how it's going to play out. I think the peeling off is going to be the housers. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1557.68s)]
*  It's going to be maybe even a Derek White. You know, the guys that you have ready-made [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  replacements on the roster. Derek White, what are you doing to me? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1567.52s)]
*  I don't, I don't like, I'm not saying it's going to happen. I would say this though. I think that [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1570.8s)]
*  this team right now as currently constructed is only protected by championships. Like you [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1575.1200000000001s)]
*  win a championship this summer, ownership is going to bring it back, right? You're not going [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1580.88s)]
*  to blow up a team that has a chance to win. You're not trading Jaylen Brown to the, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1585.2s)]
*  wherever. No chance. Or even someone like, or even someone like Derek White. Like I think Sam [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1588.88s)]
*  Hauser is probably gone. Like the second he signed that contract, when you look at what the other [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1593.68s)]
*  contract is going to be, like I was like, there's no way Sam Hauser. See, I was more worried about [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1596.56s)]
*  Drew. Cause Drew's like low thirties and you know, the right team that wants a vet and you think [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1600.64s)]
*  you're the Seltz and you're like, this is kind of a luxury to have a guy like this. Those are, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1607.8400000000001s)]
*  it's in that white holiday grouping that could be the first to go unless I hope they keep [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1612.88s)]
*  Tademan Brown together forever. And I love having those guys as a combo. And I think [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  historically they have a chance to be something really special. Just two guys playing together, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1622.72s)]
*  their whole careers like that, one draft apart, winning titles. Like that's how many pairings [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1627.2800000000002s)]
*  have done that? Like how many pairings have fallen apart before they got to that point? So, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1633.1200000000001s)]
*  but you know, if you're paying $130 million a year for two guys, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  it's almost impossible. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1642.64s)]
*  Yeah. I don't, I'm not concerned that something like breaking them up is, is on the table. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1645.3600000000001s)]
*  But again, I do think that you're going to see some guys whacked off the payroll. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1654.0800000000002s)]
*  He saw Baylor go off the other night, like Sam Hauser be watching that. Like, all right, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1658.48s)]
*  I'm out the door. Like that's right. That guy can do what I was doing. Like, I mean, that's, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1662.4s)]
*  that to me is, is what you're looking at in, in the years to come. Now, if it gets bad, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1667.68s)]
*  like if they want to get beaten the second round, you know, for some reason, not this year, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1673.68s)]
*  but like next year, then I can see it slowly start to be taken apart. But for right now, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1677.68s)]
*  it's more about the ancillary pieces and what you can replace them with. Like, look, they drafted [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1683.04s)]
*  Baylor and like, that was a surprise that they drafted him. They must've really believed in him [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1686.72s)]
*  because their payroll jumped a lot, you know, because of the guaranteed money that comes with [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1691.2s)]
*  a first round pick. They obviously believe in him and watching him go off against, was it the Nets [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1695.68s)]
*  the other night? Like that, maybe they're justified in believing that he can be the cheap alternative [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1700.24s)]
*  to Sam Hauser and be your seventh, eighth, ninth man coming off your bench. Well, the team's in a [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1705.04s)]
*  weird spot. They're stuck at second. You have Cleveland stuck at first and the Knicks probably [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1709.68s)]
*  stuck at third. And you have a month of the season left and all crappy teams for the most part on the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1715.04s)]
*  schedule. And it's like, let's try to keep everyone healthy. Let's try to give these guys the [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1720.0800000000002s)]
*  minutes. They're doing this interesting strategy with the best guys, Tatum and Brown, but they'll [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1725.52s)]
*  either won't play them or they'll play them real minutes. They're not doing like play 25, like [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1729.76s)]
*  they're either playing them a playoff game minutes or not playing them. And they have the luxury to [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1734.16s)]
*  do whatever they want and try to get Shireman and people like that going. I think they're, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1738.8s)]
*  I just think they're better than the Knicks and that if they lost to the Knicks, that would be [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1745.36s)]
*  catastrophic because they've had their number all year and everything's heading toward this [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1749.28s)]
*  Cleveland series. And Cleveland's just lost three games in a row. And for the first time, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1753.68s)]
*  it's the Russian is cut. It's just a little bit of that. And I just think they feel like if everyone's [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1758.3200000000002s)]
*  healthy and KP's in there, we're going to be in the finals again. It seems to be the attitude, right? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1765.04s)]
*  Yes. That's the attitude in Boston. I would also tell you that there's not overconfidence [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1772.0s)]
*  in the front office or the coaching staff in Cleveland either. Like I just finished [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1778.4s)]
*  this story on kind of what Evan Mobley, but on a lot of bunch of young guys in the NBA that are [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1782.88s)]
*  potential difference makers in the playoffs and talking to people in Cleveland, even though they're [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1788.88s)]
*  two and two against the Celtics during the regular season and they played really well in Boston [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1793.92s)]
*  coming back to win that game. They recognize that they have not yet gotten the Celtics best shot. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1799.0400000000002s)]
*  Like they haven't gotten that championship round haymaker to make a boxing analogy. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1805.92s)]
*  And they know that's coming. They have to figure out how they, they don't know yet how they respond [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1810.56s)]
*  to something like that. And look, the guy that worries them the most is Christas Porzingis, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1814.48s)]
*  because look, they've got Evan Mobley and Evan Mobley has been great all season long, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1819.1200000000001s)]
*  but Evan Mobley does not play well against Christas Porzingis. You look at some of the numbers, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1822.64s)]
*  they're not great. And that's a matchup that the Cavs know they have to dominate. Like if it's a [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1826.32s)]
*  wash between Mobley and Porzingis, the Celtics win in six. Like they have to completely dominate [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1831.76s)]
*  that matchup between Mobley and Porzingis. And I'm not sure they're capable of doing that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1837.6s)]
*  I think Porzingis when he's right, both ends of the floor is great. So I think in Cleveland, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1840.8s)]
*  they're happy with what they've done. No doubt about that. They're surprised by a lot of things, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1846.9599999999998s)]
*  but they're not sitting there going like, we're whatever, 10 games up on Boston, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1851.12s)]
*  we're 10 games better. They know that a conference final series is a totally different animal. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1854.32s)]
*  Well, one other thing is they kind of blew the home court against OKC if they are able to get [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1858.8s)]
*  to the finals. They just lost that in five days. They had a chance to basically control their own [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1863.68s)]
*  fate the whole way. Now OKC, and you know, they'll turn it on. So from a Celtic standpoint, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1869.68s)]
*  that's potentially looming down the road. I love the way Tatum is playing. And for me, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1875.28s)]
*  I just want to know who's on the team in round two. Is KP there in my reading stories from people [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1883.76s)]
*  like you with like, KP, hopefully in game three, he'll be back. Like if we're going down that road, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1890.4s)]
*  I think it's gonna be really hard to win. And then the West, who the F knows beyond OKC. I've [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1897.1200000000001s)]
*  changed my mind 20 times in the last week, even since we did the Sunday pot. Like I don't know [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1902.3200000000002s)]
*  what to expect in the West. So we'll see what happens. Just to put a button on the sale and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1907.52s)]
*  the team. Al Horford is the first big test, right? Like Al Horford, his contract's up, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1914.32s)]
*  right? The end of this year, like he's still invaluable, right? Like the way he's playing, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1920.08s)]
*  you got to bring him back. Like how much are they willing to spend? Is it a no-brainer bringing back [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1925.52s)]
*  at a two-year deal at kind of similar money as he made last time around, which is going to cost [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1932.24s)]
*  you a ton of money as well? Like that to me is the first test of how much this ownership group is [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1936.24s)]
*  willing to spend on this team because he's got to cost you something in real money over the course [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1941.44s)]
*  of a new deal. Well, and there's been, if you look at the history of the team, there's been some Al [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1945.6000000000001s)]
*  Horford moments over the years where most of the time they've let the guy go and kept their fingers [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1950.72s)]
*  crossed. In this case, you could make a case he's the most beloved Celtic teammate that we've seen. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1956.0s)]
*  I was trying to think, I was talking to somebody about this, about is anybody more loved by the [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1963.68s)]
*  people that play with him and coach him than Al Horford? Like that Laker game was so fascinating [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1969.2s)]
*  when the Lakers were going at him and he started talking shit and Tatum was talking shit. And [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1975.3600000000001s)]
*  apparently there was just a lot of shit talking on both sides. They kept going at Al, he's talking [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1980.24s)]
*  shit. And when he came out of that game, the bench went like crazy. They were so fired. They just [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1984.8s)]
*  absolutely loved him. And I think that would be a really tough one to leave. That's even, that's not [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1991.68s)]
*  James Posey. We want a title with you. Oh, it would suck if you left. This is like, he's in the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=1996.88s)]
*  fabric. Tatum and Brown grew up with the dude, you know? So that you're right. That's probably the [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2001.7600000000002s)]
*  first big test. My feeling is if you spend that amount of money on a team and you want to impress [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2006.4s)]
*  people in the city you grew up with, you're probably going to spend money the first couple of years. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2013.1200000000001s)]
*  But we've seen these new owners come in and they're absolutely nuts. Here are my ideas. We're going [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2016.96s)]
*  to do this. We're going to zag when everybody's zigging. And it's like that. Oh boy, here we go. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2021.0400000000002s)]
*  They're still doing it. They're still doing it. Matt Ishby did that ridiculous ESPN interview [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2025.84s)]
*  where he was talking about we're building around Devin Booker and he's the guy we're going to keep [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2030.24s)]
*  not to take this a different direction, but Devin Booker is too old to win a championship in Phoenix. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2035.36s)]
*  Simple as that. He's not too old to win a championship or lead a team to a championship. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2039.9199999999998s)]
*  He's too old to lead that team to a championship. Because that would be five years from now. Yes, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  because he's eight. Next season is age 29 season next year. Now is the time you did, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2048.4s)]
*  now is the time to sell the Celtics as a franchise to kind of bring these two together. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2054.4s)]
*  Now is the time to sell the team. Now is the time to deal Devin Booker. If Houston comes a call in [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2058.64s)]
*  with all your draft capital offering it back. If Oklahoma City calls and says here's three or four [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2062.7200000000003s)]
*  players plus three or four draft picks, you are crazy if you're Phoenix and not doing that. That's [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2067.92s)]
*  some of the new owner craziness that's still out there in the league. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2073.36s)]
*  Do you think there's a new arena in 10 years? Yes. Yes. Yes. I do too. I don't see, we should [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2075.92s)]
*  have talked about that sooner. I don't see how you spend this kind of money, but then also don't buy, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2081.36s)]
*  build an arena. There's also places you can build it. Like the Seaport's become cool again. Like [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2085.44s)]
*  it wasn't when, you know, I was younger and probably when you were younger back there, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2090.7200000000003s)]
*  but now it's become like this cool place opposite Southie and there's room to do stuff down there. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2094.4s)]
*  There's stuff near 93 that the place they were looking at for the Olympics. If you go back and [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  read the Olympic stories from 2014, there's a specific spot like past where Emerson plays [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2104.4s)]
*  soccer and lacrosse. Like when you're driving by going toward the Cape, there's this whole section [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2111.2799999999997s)]
*  that is the spot that they're going to make like the hub of the Olympics. And I feel like that, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2116.72s)]
*  I think it's called like the rail yard or something. I think that's where the arena would go. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2120.48s)]
*  That's really the only open spot that's in the city in the right way. Or it could be Seaport, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2125.2799999999997s)]
*  but I mean, Seaport's already really hard to get to back and forth now for putting 19,000 [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2131.9199999999996s)]
*  fans there would be a little rough. They'd have to reinvent the T there and figure out, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2137.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, new stops that go into that area. I would put it right on the other side of the [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2143.2799999999997s)]
*  hill in Charlestown. We're going right in the town, like 12,000 seat arena. Let's go. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2147.52s)]
*  I mean, that would be taking our mojo back. I would love to see it, but there's just no way [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2155.2s)]
*  you're not buying this team and like renegotiating your lease for TD Garden, which already by NBA [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2161.2799999999997s)]
*  arena standards is old. It's bottom third in the league in terms of age and building. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2166.88s)]
*  There's another possibility of it too, where you can, there's a second part of this where you try [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  to buy the Jacob side and the Bruins and the arena and try to own everything. Because if they leave [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2177.44s)]
*  that arena, the Bruins are screwed, right? They have this 35 year old, when was it? When was [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2184.08s)]
*  we center? 95, I think it was my first year. Ball boy with the team was the first. Oh, nice. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2192.0s)]
*  So 30 year old arena, and then you're going to lose your basketball team in like 2005 years. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZgb0q4DNo&t=2199.36s)]
