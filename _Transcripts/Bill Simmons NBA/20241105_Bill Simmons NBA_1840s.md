# Half-Baked Ideas With Kevin Wildes  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtsITXp2Gy4)
*  All right. So Wilds, ever since I've had a podcast, which was 2007,
*  Wilds would come on and do half baked ideas.
*  And I don't remember the first time he did it, but many of them are on YouTube from
*  08, 09, 2010.
*  Then on this pod, when we brought it to the ringer, same thing.
*  He's popped on. Now he's a busier guy, but every once in a while we have to grab him for the half bakes.
*  And the concept of a half baked idea,
*  it's not a fully baked idea, but there's enough in there.
*  That it makes you go, hmm, I like that.
*  All right. So what's your first half baked idea?
*  So I got a colonoscopy with the idea.
*  Go out and get your colonoscopy if you need one and everybody needs to get it checked out.
*  The idea being you might think you're fine, but you might be dying inside.
*  That's the concept that will run through the storyline.
*  Also, hard stop.
*  Second part of the story.
*  I know two families that recently got dogs.
*  And they're like they didn't want dogs for a long time.
*  We're not dog people, this and that.
*  Then they made the jump, got a dog.
*  And then, of course, they say, I can't believe we were ever in this house without a dog.
*  Thus, the half baked idea is I'm calling it the.
*  I don't even know how to pronounce it.
*  Get an Aryan. OK, it's like veterinary.
*  Get an Aryan. You have to go just like you have to go to a colonoscopy doctor every five years.
*  Every five years, you need to go to a get an Aryan.
*  And it's kind of like a therapist.
*  You sit and you talk or maybe they come to your house and you talk about whether or not you need a pet in your life.
*  So even if you already have a dog, you should have to talk about getting another dog.
*  So every you can go, all right, maybe get a dog, maybe get a cat, maybe get a snake, maybe you get something.
*  But it's an outside consultant that you have to go to every every American.
*  It's going to be in federal law.
*  Every American needs to go to a get an Aryan and they ask, figure out if you need a dog that will make your life better.
*  All right. So this is really interesting because I've had people in my life who've gotten pets and I just thought it was a mistake.
*  Oh, I could probably. They could probably go the other way, too.
*  Like, do not get a dog. You are more of a fish.
*  Well, I think if the get an Aryan should be really candid.
*  Oh, yeah. Like I've looked at you.
*  You've been living alone your whole life.
*  You seem like you're having pretty fun life.
*  You do a lot of traveling like you can't have a dog.
*  The dogs can be alone.
*  You're going to be always like either putting it like having somebody stay at your house with the dog or putting them up in one of those dog places like don't get a dog.
*  It's mean to the dog. You travel too much.
*  Yeah, that's that's prime reptile right there.
*  No, you don't. But but if you need a dog, how many dogs do you have right now?
*  Two. We have two and probably going to be two going forward.
*  OK, I know you think that, but you should probably go to the get an Aryan and be like, hey, man, we ran the numbers.
*  You're actually a three dog household.
*  I'm not saying it's a guarantee, but you should get you should get checked out.
*  My wife wants to get a third dog.
*  It's very nice right now because we basically lost our kids.
*  Like we went one kid in college and another kid who never wants to be home.
*  Very well, it's just us now.
*  So it's like a third dog.
*  And I get about like, oh, I've always loved those Bernice Mountain dogs.
*  Exactly. I was just going to say that.
*  You know, we're going to get a huge dog.
*  Yeah, you got to get huge.
*  I got a big dog medium large. Oh, yeah.
*  All right. Do you want to do one more?
*  Unless you want me to chime in with some quickies.
*  I've got one more that I think you're either going to love or really hate, which is the key sweet spot for half baked idea.
*  I've got an appetite.
*  To consume more media than I have time to consume.
*  Just like I have an appetite to consume all of the Sunday football games.
*  With but I can't watch everything live.
*  So I have red zone.
*  But shows that I have started Gladiator, I started the boys, Penguin, Yellowstone, those four shows.
*  I've watched a bit of all of those shows.
*  But but I'm not going to, you know, I find myself.
*  Well, maybe I'll get the flu and I'll be laid out.
*  That's not that's no way to live rooting for the flu so I can bang through all these shows.
*  Yeah. Some sort of Scott Hansen Hansen zone.
*  I'm calling some sort of Scott Hansen red zone thing where he's up there.
*  But all right, let's go to the Penguin.
*  Oh, the Penguin just killed this guy.
*  Oh, my God. Boom. Quick shot.
*  All right, we got to go back.
*  Now we're going over to Yellowstone.
*  Oh, my goodness. There's some real estate deal coming back.
*  All right. Let's go to the boys. We're on season one.
*  It's just for you. Maybe it's a I.
*  But I'm bouncing around. I don't need to see every little piece of plot.
*  I just need the big moments so I can be conversant.
*  I get a little emotional about, oh, my God, I can't believe, you know, RIP killed this guy on Yellowstone.
*  Red zone for serialized television.
*  Let's go over to Tell Me Lies where Bree is just fucked her professor, but the wife knows about it.
*  I don't even know that show. I got to put that on the list, I guess.
*  That's Hansen's job. That's the idea.
*  I really need this in my life.
*  Yeah, I don't really have any notes.
*  I don't even think that's a half-baked idea.
*  I think that's a fully baked idea.
*  Thank you. Just and just like, you know, YouTube has you can pick.
*  They don't let you pick the multiview.
*  They're like, here are the four shows.
*  That's what you go into.
*  It's like we're going to start season one of these four shows.
*  We are basically it's talk in there for an hour.
*  This is talk soup.
*  But you're now taking all the prestige TV shows, which we have way too many of.
*  Yeah. And we just sit there.
*  I don't know what's going on with the Penguin, but I'd love to know just enough to be able to
*  chime in at a holiday party in two months.
*  Be like, well, I was stunned when he did that in episode seven.
*  Yeah. Can you believe that?
*  Oh, no. Like, yes. Exactly right.
*  But there's also just a lot of.
*  Strip away a lot of the art of it like, ah, here's the Penguin walking through
*  Gotham in this beautiful scene.
*  I get it. But also something that Hanson's taken out of the show for me.
*  Boom, I'm out there. Red Zone, Hanson.
*  See, I thought you were going to say it's a TV takes
*  where you just listen to this podcast and they give you five things to then say
*  at like if you go to a holiday party.
*  No, I don't know if tell me lies.
*  Season two was as good as season one.
*  And here are my three points.
*  And it makes it seem like you watched it, but you really didn't know.
*  I had way more of a half-picked idea.
*  Yeah, there was an idea that I had for.
*  Since the show that we, you know, is produced.
*  Yeah. The first thing is, obviously, we kind of know what we're saying.
*  We have like notes and stats and full screened.
*  And here's my point. And here's my thing.
*  I've never said this before.
*  Like I come over and like produce your Thanksgiving dinner.
*  It's like, all right, Bill, what do you want to talk about?
*  Like, all right, I got to talk about, you know, the landscaping of my neighbors.
*  Producer. Yeah.
*  It's like, all right, what's your issue with the landscape?
*  And every other like these trees are too dumb.
*  Like those trees are too tall. Like the average tree is this.
*  I'm going to make you a full screen.
*  So the average tree is this and this block interview of whatever.
*  Like what else in this?
*  And we've got lots and I'm throwing up the seating chart.
*  Well, yeah, but I'm like, Bob's got to be in the middle
*  because Bob can go either way.
*  It's like on TV when the middle seat is an important seat on a studio show.
*  And I'm in Bob's ear.
*  I'm like, hey, Bob, don't forget.
*  Don't forget. Bill said this the other day.
*  Stick it to him. Like, right.
*  Don't bring up the election to Aunt Louise.
*  No, that's a no go.
*  She'll go nuts.
*  But I have a couple.
*  I have three tiny ones.
*  I have two that I like, but I'll give you quick ones.
*  I don't even know if this is a half baked idea.
*  Full service gas stations. Just come back.
*  Yeah, I think I got to move to New Jersey.
*  But how many how many full service gas stations are in California? None.
*  Not really.
*  It's a real everyone's on their own with gas.
*  And I just kind of miss having the guy like do my do my windshield
*  and just pump the gas for me.
*  Apparently, there's one place in Beverly Hills that does it.
*  But I miss full service gas stations.
*  I was trying to think, is there like a 2.0 version of those?
*  Because they had those like the 40s and 50s, like maybe in L.A.
*  It's stand up comics who were doing gas,
*  but they're also doing like three minutes of their act.
*  Oh, God. Yeah, I don't know.
*  I got punished. Yeah.
*  10 day Westbrook.
*  So Westbrook pops on all these different teams for a year,
*  and then he kind of wears that as welcome.
*  Right. But everybody's really excited when he shows up
*  because it's like Westbrook, second unit,
*  he'll be able to run the offense himself and he puts up all these stats
*  and he'll change the energy.
*  And each year, a team talks themselves into it.
*  But by like midway through the year,
*  but it's like, I wish we'd have Russell Westbrook.
*  It also revitalizes your superstar, like every superstar is like
*  Russ changes the our team.
*  He's like Joker the other day.
*  Yeah. This is what he does for us.
*  Like, all right.
*  That's don't back it up. And he's shooting 20 percent.
*  If he's just 10 day contract Westbrook.
*  He's just like Memphis right now is a bunch of injuries or New Orleans.
*  And it's like, oh, 10 day rest is here.
*  Comes in. He's a Hall of Famer.
*  He's padding stats, instant offense.
*  But then then you kind of you just kind of leaves.
*  It's like having leftovers in the fridge.
*  You just gone after 10 days.
*  Come again. This this will be the second full fiction reference.
*  But kind of like like the wolf like West, like I'm here.
*  Not like that is. Wow. Yeah.
*  Oh, we got you bringing Russ.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Shows up there super fast.
*  He's always dressed really well.
*  And the key is he so he signs with these teams
*  so he can make like three, four or five million a year, whatever he gets.
*  So 10 day Westbrook would just be more expensive on the salary cap.
*  It would be he basically is basically getting paid like one hundred thousand a game.
*  And you just sign in, it's like, oh, I'll do 10 day Westbrook for four games.
*  We got Jaren Jackson's out and Jaws her.
*  And we need whatever.
*  Great. And then I have a.
*  NBA announcer navigation systems. OK.
*  Oh, for your GPS.
*  Well, just for specific moments, like when you're parking
*  and you could just like switch to Ryan Ruko mode and he's like,
*  he's going to parallel park in the back and he get it. You bet.
*  Now.
*  I don't want to run this red light is going to get caught.
*  Bang.
*  All right. What do you got?
*  I actually like that one.
*  I like that one a lot.
*  This one is super. Oh, I mean, this one is super depressing.
*  You want a depressing one or a stupid one?
*  Did give us both.
*  I'll start with the depressing one. OK.
*  Going to go to
*  we're trying to go to Hawaii for our next vacation.
*  I'll be probably after my birthday, so I'll be like 47.
*  It's a long way from the East Coast.
*  Good luck. I know we're going to pit stop and then go any of them.
*  Forty seven. Yeah.
*  Brian funeral photo time for me.
*  Right. Not not too young, like like right on my casket, right there.
*  What photo you got is that photo we took on vacation in Hawaii.
*  I'm thinking about it.
*  So right now, I don't know if there's photographers that specialize in this.
*  So you get you get exposed to a professional
*  photographer a few times in your life.
*  You're born. You usually get like a nice photo.
*  Then K through 12, a guy or woman shows up
*  every every photo day. Yeah, that's good.
*  Then you're in a pretty much of a dry spell there until your wedding wedding day.
*  And then you're pretty much on your own.
*  Like there's very few times that you're going to run into a perfect
*  maybe at going down a roller coaster.
*  And that's probably a robot.
*  But that's it for all K through 12 your wedding.
*  And if you're going down a water slide with a scary face,
*  that's the only time you're getting professional photos.
*  So when you die, your poor loved ones
*  had already have the stress of dealing with your departure.
*  Now they have another stress of going through.
*  How many pictures of me are three thousand pictures on my iPhone?
*  You got to go through three thousand pictures and try to find the one.
*  No, they have to figure out your passwords.
*  Oh, yeah, like just a bunch of things and then a photo on top of it.
*  Exactly. And and I have a few things.
*  One got to be solo.
*  Got to be on the casting, can't have two people like,
*  hold on to two people. What happened here?
*  Was this some sort of accident?
*  Like your arms around somebody and it's like a cut off stump of your arm?
*  No, that's a no go.
*  Got to be solo.
*  It's got to be sort of a candid photo like, oh, look at this, which which,
*  you know, normal people have a hard time capturing.
*  You pose on a photo shirt, which is like a candid photo.
*  And who am I laughing with?
*  Like that person taking the picture.
*  Got to need a pro. Got to be smiling, obviously.
*  And I need a lived life to the fullest background.
*  You can't just have it, you know, just walking out the street at the coffee shop.
*  I have to have, wow, what? Oh, look at that.
*  Remember, you went to Hawaii. That's a great moment for him.
*  And then part of me, and this is just an idea here, I have no proof of this.
*  Part of me thinks that when you go to heaven or whatever, you may believe in.
*  And if you are a physical entity there,
*  that you need to put a recommendation up to the management at heaven
*  on how you would like to be perceived.
*  Right. Do you want to be 28 year old wilds?
*  Do you want to be mid thirties wilds?
*  Forty seven year old wilds.
*  You got to be a man because it's also confusing for everybody else.
*  Like I was just thinking like, hey, what a Benjamin Franklin.
*  He's 20 years old. Who are you?
*  He's like Ben Franklin, like Ben Franklin.
*  Bro, what are you like?
*  And he's like playing basketball.
*  Like, dude, no, you have to be.
*  Are you need your stretch for?
*  He's just like this young, like strapping, dude, like, no, dude, where you're stocking.
*  So anyways, it's I called it.
*  Taken, but since it's like the idea of the clock is ticking, tick tock, it's called.
*  No, it's I call it either weight gram,
*  casket gram or tick tock.
*  That's a photographer that only does funeral.
*  So you consult with the photographer and he's he's like,
*  great spot at the top of this mountain in Kauai.
*  We'll get background.
*  There's like a volcano over your right shoulder.
*  It could do that. Oh, wow.
*  Or I'm thinking maybe Hotel Bar,
*  just with a big drink and you're you're looking at somebody laughing
*  and there's the ocean behind you.
*  Love it. Yeah, love it.
*  I wouldn't do it honestly for that.
*  If you were the photographer, I'd be like, let's do the bar
*  because I think the clouds at the top little too on the nose.
*  So let's do the hotel bar.
*  Good lighting and it'll be great.
*  Like, save it.
*  And if you hear about my demise, let's let's print that up.
*  Well, you know how they have these national days that I hate?
*  Like, it's like National Daughters Day.
*  And then you have to feel bad if you don't post a picture of your daughter
*  because it's not it's this arbitrary holiday that we've created five years ago.
*  Maybe it should be here's the photo I want
*  shown at my funeral when I died day.
*  I mean, that's certainly then whoever dies.
*  You're just like, what did Wilds want first?
*  Oh, that Hotel Bar one and now. Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's a great one.
*  I really like this. This is good.
*  This is almost a fully baked idea. Good.
*  I'm glad I thought that was going to be more depressing.
*  This is I thought it was uplifting.
*  Oh, good. All right.
*  This is this is stupider. OK.
*  NFL game, you're going to the game.
*  What are you wearing? Jersey.
*  NBA game, wearing a jersey.
*  Soccer, wearing a jersey.
*  Baseball game, hats and jerseys.
*  Kentucky Derby full suit.
*  Kentucky Derby, either jockey jerseys,
*  little checkerboard action with the hat in the pants or dress like the horse.
*  Outfits where it's like, oh, nice markings
*  with a shirt with a mane that goes down your spine.
*  Oh, sick. You dress like your favorite horse.
*  You don't have to wear a dress or some like fancy suit dress like the jockey.
*  Got a shirt with a number.
*  Some of those shirts look great.
*  Green checkerboard with the jockey jockey shirt,
*  almost like when soccer jerseys took off like 10 years ago.
*  Yes. And all of a sudden, soccer jerseys were the rage.
*  Yes. So you say jockey jerseys happen at a moment.
*  Yeah, I don't know about the horse part.
*  Well, OK, horse, you might not want to dress as the horse,
*  but certainly you dress like the jockey.
*  They look great. And part of this is born.
*  I started riding. I bought a bike.
*  So I'm riding a bike in the first hurdle to get over after you buy the bike.
*  All right. Am I really going to buy the, you know,
*  are you going to dress like one of those guys?
*  Bill, I look fantastic.
*  You're dressing like one of those guys now.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Bill, I look great.
*  Oh, I was on a rim, my car and those guys.
*  I if you did, I would look great.
*  They would be my funeral.
*  And I was sitting by a bike.
*  They're like, that looks fantastic.
*  And it's slimming.
*  You're squeezed in there.
*  You're looking aerodynamic.
*  You're in bright colors.
*  You just look like you're like out here living life.
*  I look I look fantastic in my biking outfit.
*  You just made me think that this should be an AI feature
*  where I just get updates about my friends and everybody has to sign up
*  and just be like the Tuesday edition of your newsletter of all the people
*  you know, Kevin Wilde's now a bike guy.
*  Yeah. And that's how I just find out from the news.
*  I'll post some stuff of me looking like you look muscular in them.
*  It's like they're like Spanx in there.
*  And once you start biking, you start to get, you know,
*  cut off a little bit.
*  It's great. Wow.
*  The other people, if you're a bike guy, that's unbelievable.
*  Well, but being a bike guy, it's been fantastic.
*  The other part of this is and this is a half big idea subhead.
*  Lower body.
*  Tellable or fanatics.
*  It's really like that basketball sneakers that's taken care of hats.
*  So, so, you know, tip to toe, that's taken care of.
*  The whole upper body is taken care of.
*  All sorts occasionally, but the lower body is is there for you
*  if you want to wear a Yankees pinstripe pants.
*  Definitely. No, I do that.
*  Well, I'm just saying like they're like the lower body is available
*  for is a is an open piece of real estate for fanatics to jump on.
*  I'd wear personally, I wear the little jockey shorts,
*  jockey and high boots.
*  I look great. I have I have two that I really like that I'll go fast on,
*  but one that's not even half baked.
*  It just struck me with the NFL trade deadline.
*  Yeah. How much content we get from it, how I just wish it
*  existed in other parts of life.
*  They could be like my wife, my my wife and like all her friends.
*  It's like Tuesday's.
*  Trade deadline might get rid of like one of my friends.
*  It's like, really, which one?
*  Oh, my God.
*  And it just like the conversations it would provoke.
*  My God, you're getting rid of Helen.
*  Yeah. Well, you know, I she hasn't been doing as much this year.
*  She stopped drinking and we just go anyway.
*  All right. Here are my two.
*  Can I spin one off of that? Yeah.
*  I read a study. It was about like.
*  This is really bad, right?
*  And not joking, loneliness is like, you know, epidemic.
*  It was like 58 percent of men haven't made a friend
*  in the last year, a new friend in the last year.
*  I was like, 58, I would I put that at 99.
*  I didn't realize like everyone's like getting these new friends,
*  like a draft day of like, hey, you know, draft is coming up
*  and you just call a guy that, you know, kids, you know, kids, your
*  friends, father that you've seen in like, hey, man,
*  I just want to let you know, I took you in the second round of my friend draft.
*  We're going to let you happy to walk in a board of friends.
*  You're going to invite it to we're going to go out for a beer to
*  it like mandated. You've got to get new friends.
*  I was announced at the end of my year to my wife,
*  who my favorite new friend of the year was.
*  But you're getting new friends all the time.
*  Yes, somehow I always end up with a new friend.
*  Oh, geez, I'm stuck. I've just been rolling out.
*  York. Everybody's just it's like freaking Game of Thrones.
*  I've been I've been rolling with the same friends for a while.
*  I'm like just trying to think of a team that just like, yeah,
*  we're running it back again.
*  Like, really, we got all got a year older.
*  I got to get some new blood.
*  I'm thinking about I might.
*  I mean, I met one ability soccer friends, dads.
*  Could be a new friend.
*  I'd be a new friend.
*  I'd be a new friend.
*  The parents of the kids usually end up being a very fertile new fan base.
*  That's my well, that's all that's my only.
*  Yeah, that's my only ground.
*  I don't like a guy on the street like, hey, buddy, I did meet a random guy.
*  Like, buddy, we should be friends. Right.
*  Well, it's weird because guys being like, hey, you want to go to a sports bar
*  or watch the Laker game?
*  Yes. All right.
*  Here are my favorite two that I had.
*  I'll make them correct.
*  I feel like VHS players need to make a comeback.
*  Vinyl came back, right?
*  All of a sudden, vinyl is as big as it's ever been.
*  It's like, man, that's weird.
*  Oh, man, I shouldn't have thrown out my vinyl.
*  Oh, I kept some. Oh, there's some over there.
*  And now it's become this whole thing that's happened.
*  And Sean Fantasy for, you know, sure.
*  He's been a big physical media guy forever with Blu-rays and DVDs.
*  But there was this whole VHS era forever.
*  And it wasn't just with buying movies and TV shows.
*  It was also like, you know, if you had a video camera and you videotape
*  like your kids or people in college, you just have these VHS tapes.
*  And then all of a sudden, the VCR player just died.
*  And you couldn't even buy them.
*  And you couldn't that none of them work with HDMI cords.
*  And then you go on Amazon and they like refurbish them.
*  And it all feels super shady.
*  I just want them to come back.
*  So then I was thinking, I also don't like how annoying it is to have DVDs
*  and to stand up instead of just like with my remote.
*  I'm like, I'm going to watch something on Amazon.
*  I just press a button.
*  You like you like you like doing that, let the scroll to find stuff.
*  I would rather not move when I'm about to pick a movie.
*  But with the DVD part, you have to get up, you have to go.
*  You put the DVD and you got to press the button.
*  So then I was thinking, could they just have these VHS DVD players
*  that are attached to the side of the TV?
*  So you have like this, you know, like these long thin TVs
*  that would put on the walls and maybe on the left side.
*  It's like this little DVD thing.
*  I just plop on the side.
*  It's like a little VHS thing and it's part of the TV.
*  And that would encourage people to bring VHS and DVD.
*  So that is not only happy to be.
*  I believe that is a full baked idea.
*  They stayed at a hotel.
*  I stayed at a hotel like in the Catskills and they had like a little library
*  there of VHS and then it was included in the thing.
*  And it was like literally part of the TV, though.
*  I think being part of the TV is I think it was.
*  I think it was one unit.
*  Oh, interesting. All right. Bad idea, then.
*  No, nobody has this idea.
*  It's a great idea. But it's my best idea.
*  OK, here we go.
*  So we're on these zooms, right?
*  And sometimes you're on a zoom.
*  And I'll do like, as you know, I walk around,
*  so sometimes I'll be walking around when I'm on a zoom.
*  But then I was thinking it would be great if AI,
*  which I think we're all afraid of, but also has some really good
*  fertile things that could also help all of us.
*  I'm more pro AI than most.
*  I was thinking if AI could basically replace and replicate my face on a zoom.
*  So that the zooms happening and AI Bill is just there,
*  like nodding every once in a while and like a laugh.
*  And it just can kind of react to the cues of the zoom.
*  But I'm not actually there. I'm just in another room.
*  I'm not even on the zoom or I'm on the zoom,
*  but I didn't feel like being on the zoom.
*  So I just did a bill for the zoom.
*  And I'm just there listening and I'm not really on the zoom.
*  AI Bill is pretending to be me on the zoom.
*  Yeah, it feels like AI is good enough that we could pull this off.
*  And I think we should use AI for good.
*  And part of AI for good is let's figure out ways to cheat on zoom
*  so people don't know we are not actually on the zoom.
*  Can I ask you a question?
*  Because I do very few zooms now with that are.
*  Do you feel the need that zoom replace conference calls?
*  Like, why are you just on a conference call?
*  Why do you need to see everybody?
*  I don't because it's a it's a leftover COVID thing.
*  But we like seeing everybody.
*  But no one likes to be seen.
*  Or maybe they kind of do because nobody goes to an office anymore.
*  Very few or less.
*  And it's like this interaction time.
*  We're in the. Yeah, I guess so.
*  We're in the office here.
*  Have an atypical situation.
*  We're in the office.
*  And then with a zoom that we have, everyone's cameras off.
*  I'm like, we're actually just having a conference call.
*  The poor conference call industry is just really.
*  Conference calls are done.
*  Yeah. Dial in, press this pin. It's over.
*  It's just seems now anyway.
*  No, I face for zooms. What's work?
*  What do you have for your last half baked?
*  Is it a rapid, rapid fire?
*  She's going to shoot three until I pick one.
*  Yeah, I have to hold on. All right.
*  I have this one from.
*  Hutchinson was injured.
*  And he went to the game and I said sports bar.
*  And he looked very comfortable as he recovers.
*  So Godspeed, Aiden Hutchinson
*  sports bar, but the seating looks like you just had major surgery.
*  It's more of like you're just kind of being pampered.
*  But even like an Alamo Draft House sports bar.
*  Yeah, but you're it looks like you just had surgery.
*  So you really it's really just I mean, it's really short for.
*  It's a bar where you put your feet up and take your shoes off.
*  I think that's where that's kind of the underlying current.
*  But I know it's just thing. OK.
*  I don't like a self check out.
*  I'm not a huge fan of that.
*  I hate it as well.
*  I'm like, all right, I have to work here to now.
*  Not a fan. However.
*  Like.
*  My own food at your dining establishment.
*  So all buffets love it.
*  Element of fun. The movie theater for my own sodas.
*  Fantastic. There's like a yogurt shop in town.
*  You can make your own yogurts. Do that. That's great.
*  Those like little like hibachi place, a little teriyaki
*  where you like have a little open flame. Fantastic.
*  Is I don't have this is a quarter big.
*  Is there a another food that is ripe for that treatment?
*  Where it's like, yeah, you you actually go and you just do it yourself.
*  I'm like, what? They don't do it for you.
*  Like, no, you have to do it.
*  They give you all the tools, but you get to do it.
*  Like, great. But I don't know what the food is.
*  So this is happening with pizza, at least with this two point
*  over the pizza, where they give you these giant, heavy, sharp scissors
*  and they just bring the pizza out and it's just a circle.
*  And then you have to cut the slices with the scissors.
*  A bunch of that's like as they're doing.
*  That's just like the ninth inning.
*  I'm not going to buy one. I come in in like.
*  So you're saying like they give you the ingredients for a soup.
*  Oh, and you stand in the bowl and you like make a soup
*  or you make like your own.
*  I wouldn't mind.
*  I wouldn't mind being the guy who threw the pizza.
*  Oh, you want to literally make your own pizza.
*  But I don't just like a lot of times make your own pizza
*  just means throw some basil on it.
*  I wouldn't mind. I don't know.
*  I'm trying to find out the best thing.
*  A very hot steak.
*  I don't know.
*  But I know I like pouring my own sodas and I know I like,
*  you know, cooking my own
*  hibachi. So I don't know where you're grilling your own hot dogs and burgers.
*  You just get your own grill.
*  Oh, that's not a bad idea.
*  You get a bar.
*  I just say you're just on there and then you're you're you're like Tony Soprano.
*  That's what it is.
*  It's a giant sports bar and it's almost set up like pop golf.
*  Yeah. You go in there.
*  It's like, here's your station.
*  Here's your grill.
*  Maybe you have like a huge smoker.
*  Maybe you have a pig on a spit.
*  Right. It's like, this is your little area.
*  You got to do it.
*  And you're making friends.
*  I mean, hey, buddy, you want to be friends? Come over.
*  So you're basically like you get to be Adam Perry Lang for like four hours.
*  Yeah, it's hot. Yeah, it's high.
*  And I got a big grill like, hey, buddy, because I'm grilling by myself.
*  Making friends and grilling like you're competing other guys
*  more for a high end grills.
*  That's pretty good.
*  Get anything like anybody had this that we solved it.
*  Kevin Wilds, you can see him on first things first every single day.
*  We're aligned on Drake May for the next 20 years.
*  Can't wait. Can't wait to see your your funeral photo.
*  Oh, thank you. Mine later.
*  I think I have a good one from Hawaii last summer.
*  I have a lay on when you have a lay on this and that like that's like points.
*  Yeah, you're always having a blast.
*  Yeah. This guy really lit.
*  Yeah. All right. Good to see you, Wilds.
*  All right. Good to see you.
