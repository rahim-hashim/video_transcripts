# OKC’s Revenge on Dallas, NBA Cup Nitpicks and Favorite Rookies  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m9hSG2Ulo4)
*  Guys, I'm going to start here.
*  OKC beats Dallas.
*  Chikobi, is OKC like a borderline lock for you in the West,
*  or is there somebody else you're afraid of?
*  Because the more I watch them,
*  the more I just wonder who beats them in the West.
*  It's the defense.
*  It's just, it's, I, it's, it's on a different level
*  than every other team.
*  I don't want to play against this team.
*  You can just see the frustration
*  on the body language of the Mavs.
*  They can't throw basic passes without being harassed.
*  Like, you remember that lively rebound he got,
*  and the Cruiser just knocked it out of bounds?
*  Just like, what are you, it's just annoying.
*  They're just swarming Wasps, and it's so frustrating,
*  because I was rooting for the Mavs
*  because I wanted to close game,
*  and it's just impossible to do anything against them.
*  It's awful.
*  It's awful to play against that team.
*  Yeah, they're the clear favorite now.
*  And I know Dallas is going to sit here and say,
*  oh, we didn't have PJ Washington,
*  and we beat them last year in this, and it's fine.
*  They should be confident.
*  But from what I'm seeing, Bill, their net rating,
*  their defensive rating, like Jacobi just said,
*  and then the eye test.
*  Oh my God, yeah, Luca threw a lob,
*  I think it was to Lively near the end of the game,
*  that he's thrown 100 times,
*  and all of a sudden there was two Thunder guys,
*  and they were playing small, and they intercepted it.
*  I think they had 12 steals, 31 points off turnovers.
*  But more importantly, they just frustrate
*  the hell out of everybody.
*  And I feel like they're so far and away
*  better than anything else I'm seeing in the West
*  through the first quarter of the season,
*  that yeah, I'm going to say they're the favorite,
*  to come out of the Western Conference.
*  Fandul agrees with you, but the odds for the OKC Thunder
*  in the West, I thought they'd be a minus,
*  but they're plus 190 in the West.
*  And they just seem too athletic and too fast
*  for maybe any team except the Celtics.
*  Because I think at least the Celtics,
*  it's the perimeter guys.
*  You watch Dallas, and Dallas was on a good run.
*  They'd won 11 and 12, they really felt like
*  they were starting to turn into something.
*  And they just look slow tonight compared to OKC.
*  You put Luca, you put Kyrie, you put Klay Thompson,
*  Najeeb Marshall, who was really good in the first half.
*  Those are good players, those are guys
*  in the top five team in the league.
*  And OKC just seemed faster and younger and more athletic.
*  And Luca, I don't know, what was going on
*  with Luca Jacoby, what was your take?
*  One of the things that analysts always say about Luca
*  is like you can't speed him up, you can't speed him up.
*  There's a part of him who's like,
*  hey Luca, can you speed up?
*  Like you know, it's like, oh, you can't speed him up.
*  He's always at his own pace.
*  He's like, cool, cool, cool.
*  How about you like move a little bit off the ball?
*  Like there's a couple of sessions
*  he was just like in the corner.
*  Like he's kind of getting that James Harden off ball energy.
*  They're like, oh, someone else has the ball.
*  So I'm just gonna stand here with my arms at my sides,
*  like straight up and down.
*  It's like, it was a frustrating Luca day.
*  They were doubling him early, which I think was smart.
*  Because they doubled him early
*  and kind of got the ball out of his hands
*  and didn't let him catch a rhythm until the second half
*  for like a brief spurt.
*  You know what though?
*  I still think they're the number two team in the West for me
*  if I had to say who can actually make the finals.
*  I still have Dallas second.
*  I don't think this is a great matchup for them.
*  And I was trying to think of like the rock paper scissors
*  thing with the West.
*  I don't know if you guys saw the OKC Houston game.
*  Maybe it was 10 days ago.
*  Houston, I think is the team in the West
*  that can go toe to toe on this like crazy,
*  young, hungry pit bull, just speed,
*  athleticism all over the place.
*  I think that's the only way in the West,
*  nobody's gonna overpower them.
*  There's not gonna be like, obviously not the Lakers,
*  but the LeBron AD type situation where it's just,
*  oh my God, they just got bully balled.
*  They got out rebounded by 10 rebounds.
*  I don't see that happening this year.
*  I almost feel like you have to beat them with what they do.
*  Is there anybody else you see, Kirk?
*  Houston, I think, you know, we'll see tomorrow
*  if they can beat Golden State here in this quarterfinal.
*  I don't see anybody else,
*  because Minnesota, I think coming in to the season, Bill,
*  was that other team for me,
*  and they have just been off to an awkward start.
*  So I don't see the Randall piece really fitting in there
*  to put them in that category.
*  And Dallas was the hottest team in the league, period,
*  before tonight.
*  And I think they clearly deserve number two status.
*  They won the conference, they beat this team
*  in the playoffs last year in six games.
*  So I think until further notice,
*  it's OKC, Dallas, then Houston.
*  And then actually, I don't know who I'd put before.
*  So you'd have Houston third, or just to beat OKC?
*  Did you just have Houston third in general?
*  I love Houston at three.
*  And I wanna see what they do in this tournament.
*  I know some people think it's silly,
*  but I think this is a catapult for them.
*  If they beat Steph and Steve Kerr tomorrow,
*  and they get to Vegas,
*  and they play the Oklahoma City Thunder,
*  I think it really starts to feel like
*  they're not just a flash in the pan.
*  Like OKC build, their defensive indicators scream contender.
*  They are not, just like Orlando.
*  Orlando, OKC, and Houston.
*  Three young, pain in the ass defenses
*  that nobody wants to play against.
*  And Emei has really built that team up.
*  So I would put them at three.
*  I don't know if there's somebody I'm forgetting.
*  The other thing, well, you're forgetting Memphis,
*  because, and we have to mention that,
*  because Chikobi does a podcast twice a week
*  on the mismatch with somebody who's like,
*  how the fuck can Kurt Goldsberry not mention Memphis
*  for eight minutes there?
*  What the fuck is he doing?
*  That might be intentional.
*  I might have heard that he fast forwards
*  the minutes that I speak on this show.
*  Is that true?
*  He does the 15 second fast forward?
*  Memphis right now is fifth offensive rating,
*  seventh defensive rating.
*  The per 36 stats are crazy for them too.
*  Like Jah, who's really only playing like 28 minutes a game,
*  but he would be 28 and 11 if he played 36.
*  Brandon Clark looks great.
*  So from a speed standpoint, maybe,
*  but I'd kind of like to see those guys play
*  for 20 games, Chikobi.
*  And I'll tell you this, they're dining a lot
*  off that Celtics game on Saturday,
*  where the Celtics had played five and seven.
*  They had played Milwaukee the night before,
*  and this, like, heated.
*  But my dad was saying, it was like a third round
*  playoff game kind of intensity.
*  And then the next day, the Celts have to run it back,
*  and they had no legs, they were dead,
*  and Memphis kind of steamrolled them.
*  But I don't think they should take
*  too much out of that, Chikobs.
*  I don't think any of these teams
*  would be a favorite in a series against the Thunder.
*  And watching the Thunder tonight,
*  watching them just fly around,
*  and watching SGA be like a true go-to weapon on offense,
*  the way that some of the Rockets don't have,
*  to be honest with you.
*  And then every once in a while,
*  they cut to this guy in a velour sweatsuit
*  in the second row with a big beard,
*  who looked like he leveled up.
*  Chet, obviously I'm talking about,
*  it's like he's coming back.
*  Like, they have a major weapon.
*  He looks like a UFC fighter.
*  Like, he's like this UFC middleweight
*  hanging out outside the octagon,
*  waiting to see who he's gonna fight
*  in the next UFC card.
*  But it's Chet Holmgren, he's seven foot one.
*  Yeah, but I think that people sleep on the fact
*  that they're doing all of this without him.
*  And a lot of teams are missing players,
*  but he's like, I don't know,
*  second or third best player.
*  Probably their third best player.
*  Yeah, we haven't seen their,
*  I mean, what we did get to see tonight,
*  especially was the Hartenstein piece,
*  the whole, the kind of rebounding center
*  rim protection guy that they just haven't had.
*  Like, we were talking about some of the matchups with them.
*  One of the things that's interesting with Houston
*  is Houston's first in the league in rebounding,
*  they're almost averaging 50 rebounds a game.
*  You know what?
*  Sometimes I like the counting stats.
*  I know the fancy kids, they love the advanced stats,
*  and Kirk's got his efficiency map.
*  And I love all that stuff too,
*  but sometimes I like to know
*  who gets the most rebounds every game.
*  And Houston's getting 50 a game.
*  So to Jacoby's point, Kirk,
*  like, I do feel like they need Chet and Hartenstein
*  in a Houston series.
*  But the flip side with Houston is,
*  I still don't really know who their go-to guy is.
*  I watch them game to game and it's like,
*  because they're my favorite league pass team.
*  And it's like, really?
*  We're doing the Fred Van Viet step back?
*  That's our shot with 50 seconds left?
*  I don't think they know.
*  Like, they'll go to Shungun sometimes,
*  depending on the matchup,
*  but it's kind of like a last shot by a committee team,
*  which makes me nervous in the playoffs.
*  Yeah, I think that's valid.
*  And I think that we went too long
*  not talking about what we saw from SGA tonight.
*  And I think he really is the differentiator
*  in the top of the West,
*  because he is legitimately the MVP candidate
*  over there right now.
*  When you look at those three teams we talked about,
*  you throw in Memphis, maybe John Moran,
*  but SGA is on a different plane.
*  And what we saw tonight from him on both sides of the court,
*  nearly scoring 40 points,
*  and then just putting up crooked numbers.
*  Made some threes, five for nine from three.
*  Five for nine from three,
*  and then just sets the tone on defense too.
*  He is a truly, truly impressive two-way superstar,
*  Bill Simmons, and I think no other team has that.
*  And if it does get to sort of crunch time at the end,
*  you know that the guy who has the ball in his hands
*  can score in an isolation situation.
*  By the way, he's isolating more than anybody else
*  in the league.
*  Houston doesn't have that.
*  That is fair to say.
*  And I think that is one of the things
*  that separates the Oklahoma City Thunder
*  from everybody else in the West right now,
*  is that their best player can be that guy
*  at the end of a big game like we saw tonight.
*  Houston does have Dylan Brooks doing Dylan Brooks stuff.
*  I think SGA would be the best guy in the West
*  if Jokic wasn't averaging a 56.1 a game,
*  points, rebounds, and assists.
*  He's in the 56 club right now.
*  It's like him and Will Chamberlain.
*  She's the two of them.
*  They're hanging out.
*  That's it.
*  Who do you have in the MVP ladder right now?
*  Just between those two.
*  Jokic is having the greatest statistical season
*  of our adult lifetime.
*  I agree, but does it matter to you
*  that OKC is emerging as a clear number one
*  and they're sort of dropping down to maybe play in status?
*  Does that factor into the Professor Simmons model?
*  Yeah, it's early, right?
*  I mean, Denver hasn't won two straight games for a month.
*  I don't know what's going on with Jibal Murray.
*  Jokic, I promise you, is in like,
*  oh cool, I scored 104 points this weekend.
*  That's not what he's about,
*  but I don't know if he has a choice.
*  I wanna see if it's 47, 48 wins is kind of a cutoff for me,
*  but if you're a sixth seed or a seventh seed,
*  I think it gets tough if there's some real candidates.
*  I think Tatum's a candidate.
*  SGA is absolutely a candidate.
*  Chakov's, I think that thing that would really clinch it
*  for SGA having an argument,
*  maybe even becoming a favorite,
*  as if OKC just becomes like a 65-win team,
*  which I think is in play as hard as the West is.
*  It seems like an accident when they lose.
*  I'm always surprised when they lose, right?
*  I think 65 might be a little high,
*  but I think they're gonna run away
*  with the number one seed in the Western Conference,
*  which is obviously the stronger conference.
*  They're 19 and five right now for the record.
*  I try to stay away from the MVP stuff,
*  you know what I mean?
*  On December.
*  In December?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But what Jokic has done has been very impressive.
*  What he did this weekend, as you mentioned,
*  I'm sure he's like, I don't want to do,
*  I don't wanna take 39 shots in a basketball game.
*  He's like, what are you saying?
*  You were like that this weekend.
*  When you were taking a lot of shots, you were never happy.
*  I know, I know.
*  You wanted to do no looks,
*  and you wanted to do good entry passes
*  and just play team basketball.
*  That's like Jokic.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  Hey, what did he do this weekend?
*  Lose to the Wizards?
*  Is that what caught your eye?
*  Lost to the Wizards.
*  Lost to the Wizards and beat the Hawks.
*  Yeah, he scored 104 points.
*  That's true.
*  It is crazy.
*  It is crazy how little he has around him.
*  What really jumped out at me about those two games
*  was the Westbrook Jokic connection.
*  Like Westbrook was just feeding him.
*  Westbrook was like,
*  the best player on the planet is on my team.
*  Let me just get him in a position to score.
*  It was really impressive.
*  I was impressed by Westbrook this weekend.
*  Yeah, because Murray is kind of like Jokic's basketball wife.
*  And with Westbrook now,
*  he's kind of flirting with the office assistant,
*  who just kind of moved into the office.
*  And it's like, whoa, Jokic just went to get coffee
*  with Westbrook.
*  Does Murray know about this?
*  It's been 30 minutes.
*  That's our second game.
*  The SGA thing, I always say this every year,
*  it's just crazy to me after going to some of those games
*  when he was a rookie that this is the guy he is now.
*  That he's in a game with Luca
*  where he just completely obliterates Luca and Luca's team.
*  They have no answer for him.
*  If I'm Dallas Kirk,
*  who's my guy that's gonna be guarding SGA
*  if I'm seeing them in round two or round three?
*  Who's my stopper for SGA?
*  You know, I think PJ Washington is a huge part
*  of that equation. So, subsides, yeah.
*  And I don't know if that's the correct answer,
*  but it's not gonna be Kyrie and it's not gonna be Luca.
*  I think we all know that.
*  And then they have the big.
*  And I think PJ would be my answer,
*  but dude, who can guard this guy?
*  Nobody can guard this guy.
*  So, Dallas, I think beat them last year
*  on both sides of the ball.
*  And I think that it was really PJ who,
*  if you look back at the stats from that series,
*  did a lot on both sides.
*  Yeah, he made a lot of threes and yeah.
*  So, I think I'm hard.
*  I can't talk myself into what I saw from Dallas
*  beating Oklahoma City,
*  but I have very, very, very big recency bias right now
*  because of what we just watched.
*  I think if I zoomed back out seven game series,
*  yeah, if PJ is gonna be 20 and 10,
*  like kinda like he was,
*  I think it was 18 and eight in that series
*  and shooting threes and playing great defense
*  and they have their bigs and Luca and Kyrie,
*  obviously at the end of games,
*  they could win four games against that team
*  if everything broke their way.
*  Last year they were too small
*  and they almost won the series anyway, OKC.
*  And it came down to that play in the corner
*  when SGA, the foul when he played perfect defense,
*  and they lucked out with that one.
*  But they also didn't have Hartenstein last year
*  and Chet got overpowered in that series and just.
*  Or Caruso, and Caruso was great tonight.
*  Yeah, they didn't have Caruso.
*  It was great tonight.
*  A different team and they almost beat them last year.
*  So I'm feeling great if I'm OKC.
*  The other thing, and who knows,
*  Shams wrote this piece today about
*  could Jimmy Butler get traded?
*  Zach Levin, I know Jacobi has some thoughts on it.
*  OKC to me is the perfect type of team
*  that could make trades
*  because they have all these movable contracts,
*  cheap contracts, they can add stuff together.
*  They're not getting crushed by the apron.
*  They have a million picks they could trade.
*  I am so confused by the trade rules.
*  And I've read everything and as you guys know,
*  I'm the trade Mr. Shane Picasso.
*  Like I take this seriously.
*  I am just absolutely flummoxed by these rules.
*  And even that thing today I read where it's like,
*  yeah, Jimmy Butler.
*  It's like, I'm not sure anybody can add Jimmy Butler.
*  From what I understand about these rules,
*  it feels like they made him too hard Jacobi.
*  And I'm gonna be useless at the trade deadline.
*  I don't like it.
*  Zach Levin and Jimmy Butler, I don't think will be traded.
*  And I think to bring Jimmy Butler,
*  you have to match the salary.
*  So you're giving up whatever, $40 million worth of players
*  to bring in Jimmy Butler who wants a new contract.
*  He has a $52 million player option that he might exercise.
*  It just seems like who is Jimmy Butler away from contending?
*  And if you're the Thunder,
*  you're gonna add a player later, Chet Holmgren,
*  your third best player in your second big.
*  Like if you were the Thunder,
*  why would you ever even think about
*  picking up a phone call from my in?
*  Well, you're not doing that.
*  Golden State's the team.
*  I think it would be Golden State.
*  Just I know.
*  Are they Jimmy Butler away from contending?
*  Well, I think Shams put in, he had the Texas teams.
*  San Antonio would be super interesting for that,
*  but I think they would have to resign them.
*  And I don't know if that's on their timetable,
*  but Golden State I think has real urgency with,
*  I'm not just a body language guy,
*  but I'm also the trade detective.
*  And I did notice this weekend,
*  all of a sudden they're pushing Kaminga.
*  They're putting them in the starting lineup.
*  Draymond Green's like, you can have my spot.
*  When has Draymond Green ever been this magnanimous?
*  Just there's a lot of red flags.
*  Where I was like, huh, what are you guys doing?
*  Almost feels like you're trying
*  to showcase Kaminga for somebody.
*  No, no, take my spot.
*  Draymond Green, the guy who punched Jordan Poole,
*  now he's Mr. Magnanimous, take my spot.
*  I don't know, something that feels like
*  the team because they're on a specific window with Curry.
*  If you feel like you can contend for a title with Curry
*  at age 36, he's already wearing down
*  over the first five, six weeks.
*  Butler makes sense for them.
*  Kirk, you're nodding.
*  Yeah, I think they've been showcasing players all year.
*  I think it helps explain why Steve Kerr's
*  been playing 12 players a night.
*  Oh, look at all these guys.
*  You could read into it.
*  And I think they're one player short of being-
*  So you're saying they're like the farmer's market?
*  Come on over, we got pistachios.
*  We got Kyle Anderson, organic.
*  There's some chicken, got chicken over here.
*  Free sample.
*  It's a full chicken, some fruit.
*  Farm raise Kyle Anderson over here.
*  But I think, but Jimmy Butler to Houston intrigues me too
*  because of something you said earlier, Bill,
*  which is like, who's their guy at the end of the game?
*  We don't have that guy.
*  And Jimmy's from Texas.
*  You could see E-May talking himself into Jimmy Butler.
*  I'm not sold on it.
*  The other thing that I would say is the trade machine,
*  Picasso, is coming into hard times.
*  This new CBA has pretty much cut the number of teams
*  that could make a trade into half, if not more,
*  because so many teams are limited into what kinds of trades,
*  the financial rules, what they can and can't send out
*  or take back are so punitive or prohibitive
*  that just the trade market itself has shrunk.
*  And I think that's going to sort of limit
*  the amount of Picassoing you can do between the 715
*  and the Trevora.
*  I think it's beyond limiting.
*  I think it's gonna like really, really harm it.
*  But so selfishly I'm mad because I love making up fake trades
*  and they're just gonna be super unrealistic.
*  But Jacobes, there's this flip side to it
*  where I kind of like it.
*  Where guys who are in situations they might not love,
*  like to me it's like if we're driving,
*  like say Jacobi, you have your three kids in the car
*  and you're like, we're driving all the way to Washington DC
*  and we're not stopping.
*  But your kid's like, dad, can we stop?
*  Can we get something?
*  Can we stop, stop?
*  And they just wear you down and you eventually stop.
*  All these apron rules are basically like the kids
*  are trapped in the car for the entire ride now.
*  And then you're like, I'm gonna get off.
*  Can we stop?
*  You're like, can't, sorry, can't trade you.
*  Nobody wants you.
*  We're not stopping until we get to Uncle House's house.
*  We gotta get to Uncle House's house.
*  But everyone's trapped in the car
*  and you kind of have to make the best of it.
*  And this is what the NBA used to be like.
*  You're like, hey, you're stuck on your team.
*  It's also like the Jimmy Butler thing from Shams
*  earlier this morning was like, oh, here are the teams
*  that he wants to go to.
*  It's like, cool.
*  Right.
*  It's kind of like the NFL was like,
*  go ahead, find one.
*  Like it's like, just because you want to go to those teams
*  doesn't mean there's a deal between us and those teams.
*  And to put that out publicly, it's like,
*  it almost feels like they don't really understand
*  the implications of the new CBA.
*  It's not happening.
*  That's a great point, dude.
*  Like the whole trade demand ecosystem,
*  the whole science of the trade demand
*  from the player's perspective has to get updated too.
*  Because you can't just say, oh, I wanna trade
*  and make sure it's the Phoenix or whatever.
*  But look at Zach Levine's situation.
*  Like he's playing well for Zach Levine.
*  Like he's 22, five and five.
*  I've watched a couple games where in the fourth quarter,
*  like he's, you know, as good as he's ever looked
*  and he could have checked out or been like,
*  well, I'm gonna nurse an injury until you guys trade me,
*  but he's not gonna get traded.
*  So he might as well make the best of it.
*  It's a little reminds me of what happened in football.
*  Where in football, there's like never trades, right?
*  Nobody's like, we traded our left tackle today
*  for somebody who's starting outside linebacker.
*  It's just everybody's kind of stuck on their team
*  until the end of the year.
*  And maybe that's what basketball's becoming,
*  which is bad for podcast content,
*  but it's maybe better for basketball, right?
*  I think so.
*  And I think there's one more layer of it,
*  which is like the moneyball era of pro basketball
*  is so intense.
*  Like we know so much about how bad, bad contracts are,
*  particularly in this new CBA.
*  That those were the contracts the teams used to be able,
*  hey, take this guy.
*  Maybe you can deal with the contract for a year or two
*  and win a title.
*  No, like I was trying to think of who the best team
*  with a terrible contract is, and there aren't many.
*  And so it's like, okay, do you want this Levine deal
*  or this Beale deal?
*  The answer to that question is smaller than ever,
*  not to mention the point we already made.
*  The rules to get that player in a trade
*  are more sort of strict than ever.
*  So yeah, I think we're in a brand new era
*  and it is bad for podcast content.
*  It might be Jamal Murray.
*  Like his extension hasn't even kicked in yet.
*  Well, if he's gonna look like he's looked,
*  I mean, there's some other ones like Nurkic.
*  I'm sure Phoenix would be dying to trade him
*  in five seconds, right?
*  But yeah, if you look at the best three teams,
*  the Celtics, OKC, and Cleveland,
*  none of them really have like the,
*  oh man, I wish we didn't have this contract guy.
*  All the contracts are pretty good.
*  But I also feel like, seems like people knew
*  this era was coming and the smarter teams were very careful.
*  Even that OKC deal for Hartenstein,
*  they overpaid him for three years
*  based on what his market was.
*  But it's actually a smart deal.
*  That's how they got him and it's not gonna kill them
*  down the road unlike how Juan Soto's gonna kill the Yankees
*  in the last five years of his deal
*  when he's just destroying them for 60 million a year.
*  The Mets, that meant the Mets.
*  NBA Cup, does this work?
*  Jacobes, it's year two.
*  Here's my case for maybe it doesn't work.
*  I didn't want the Celtics to make the quarterfinals
*  or semifinals and have to play the two extra games.
*  I wanted the rest for them.
*  So that tells me fundamentally,
*  maybe this doesn't 100% work,
*  that I wanted my team not to make it.
*  OK, that's a fair point and I totally understand that thinking.
*  I think the Cup works, but I'll address your question
*  and I'll say this.
*  How upset are the Mavs right now
*  after being on the road for like a month,
*  having everyone be sick and they're like,
*  oh, we don't have to go to Vegas and we get what?
*  Seven days off in the middle of the year
*  to sort of get healthy.
*  And I think the Mavs are on the plane
*  and be like, yeah, it kind of sucks.
*  I wish we won, but I don't know.
*  I don't think they're really bombed tonight.
*  Yeah, I think it was like 100,000 we didn't get.
*  Yeah, but it's four teams.
*  To me, it's four teams like the Hawks,
*  the Rockets and the Thunder.
*  Like I think that it's really for up and coming teams
*  to get sort of like one in your done experience.
*  So I don't think it's broken,
*  but I think there are certain teams like the Celtics
*  coming off a championship,
*  like what we get to win the Emirates Cup.
*  Like, no, I'm good, I'll take the time off.
*  What do you think, Kirk?
*  I think it's working, but I think those are valid points.
*  In fact, I talked to one Western Conference Executive
*  who's like, oh, I'm kind of glad we don't have to go play
*  at Oklahoma City tonight and maybe play Houston and Vegas.
*  And like, I think I'd much rather have the time off
*  or these lesser opponents.
*  I think the league has something.
*  I also think it's really cool
*  that we had these two games tonight
*  and the whole league was watching them.
*  And I wish we had more of that,
*  that sort of community feel where it's not just like
*  league pass overload,
*  where these games are meaningful in December.
*  Like, let's not forget, like this time of year
*  is really hard.
*  I do think, and I think we talked about this last time,
*  they should use the divisions for the groups
*  and just bring some spice and meaning back
*  to those groupings of teams.
*  I think there's some little stuff.
*  I'm glad we have it.
*  But I think it is fair to say that some teams
*  are kind of not disappointed
*  they're not going to Vegas this weekend.
*  I know Embiid's disappointed.
*  He wanted to get those two extra games in.
*  I like the NBA Cup,
*  but I think that's the criticism.
*  I was thinking, should there be a couple other things
*  that you win if you win,
*  beyond like just the money?
*  Like, what if you could get an apron
*  for the rest of the season?
*  I don't know why the players would care about that,
*  but the fans I think would be like,
*  the Phoenix Suns all of a sudden would be like,
*  wait, we're out of the lock separate apron for three months?
*  It's like a get out of jail free card for the apron.
*  What if you guaranteed the sixth playoff spot?
*  That's what I think they should do.
*  You can't fall lower than six if you win.
*  You gotta move it later in the season then,
*  because like if you're locked into six,
*  like what are we doing?
*  Well, you could think about the season a little differently.
*  It's an advantage, right?
*  You know you don't have to be in the playing game.
*  You know you're going no lower than six.
*  You can rest guys a little differently.
*  Like it's a real advantage for the season,
*  I think would be the appeal.
*  But then if you're a team like Atlanta
*  or even Houston, who's probably gonna be a top six team
*  anyway, but I think that would be pretty Orlando
*  who's losing their entire team to torn obliques.
*  Like you would kind of want the sixth seed.
*  I like that.
*  The other one, that's really it.
*  You could do a draft pick thing,
*  but I don't know why the players on the team would care.
*  It's like, oh, we've locked down the 15th pick.
*  No, it would be like an insignificant draft pick thing.
*  You get like an extra second rounder or something.
*  Okay, great.
*  Which of Cubs, we both have the reality background.
*  You once upon a time were the czar of reality TV.
*  Is there a reality thing we could steal for this?
*  Like you win and you get to use that power
*  to fuck over another team in some way.
*  Like you could say.
*  Oh, I haven't thought about it in that way.
*  You get your cross and it's like the Celtics now
*  lose a game seven at home and you just like stick them
*  with some sort of terrible competitive disadvantage.
*  Like a rule changes like TJ would just come out
*  at halftime and be like, all right guys,
*  here are the four point shots.
*  Three circles.
*  You know, corner threes.
*  I think they should use it as a testing ground
*  for like rule changes.
*  Like I think that'd be kind of fun if they were just like
*  no three point line and then now a four point line
*  or there's no corner threes.
*  I think that'd be fun.
*  And I understand like there are reasons you couldn't do that,
*  but just while we're spit balling,
*  I think sort of experimenting about rule changes
*  or court changes you've been considering in these games
*  because they are different.
*  It could be a playground for that.
*  Yeah, like the Elam ending.
*  Wait, one more thing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The Elam ending would be great.
*  And I know they got rid of it from the All-Star game bill,
*  but like tonight the end of that first game
*  was like 25 minutes, the last two or three minutes.
*  And it bled into the second game.
*  It's like, what are we doing?
*  Doing this free throw, free throw thing.
*  Like just let somebody win.
*  And the NBA Cup quarterfinals, semis and finals
*  are all Elam ending.
*  We just hit a certain score and the game's over.
*  I'm not gonna have that.
*  I mean, every pickup game we've ever played
*  ends with a bucket, dude.
*  And then we watch these free throw contests.
*  The worst one I saw this year was Celtics Cavs
*  and it was like 30 minutes.
*  It was back and forth, back and forth.
*  And now, cause I always say this,
*  the team that's ahead is now fouling a lot of the time.
*  So it's just adding to it.
*  Yeah, so I'm a big Elam ending guy,
*  but I like Jacoby's idea.
*  Make it feel special, do something else.
*  Elam ending is the best I got for that one.
*  Jacoby, would SGA be fun to play with?
*  Absolutely.
*  Would he be fun to play pickup with?
*  Okay.
*  Absolutely, cause especially-
*  He leads the league in unassisted baskets.
*  So he's countering the situations
*  where you don't feel needed.
*  I know, but here's the thing.
*  But if you're in a pickup game and you're down six,
*  you want SGA and your team so you stay on the court.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like, you always associate guys
*  you wanna play pickup with,
*  guys that move the ball and get teammates involved
*  and sort of like put people in spots.
*  No, I wanna stay on the court.
*  And yeah, but you have SGA just to stay on the court.
*  That's why he's good to play pickup with.
*  Yeah, when we played, we had that one guy
*  who was the stay on the court guy,
*  where we knew we would basically just have to rebound
*  and play defense and he was gonna score nine of the 11 points.
*  I can't remember what his name was.
*  Jalen Rose, I think it was Jalen Rose.
*  Yeah, Jalen Rose.
*  Jalen was unfair.
*  His name was Jalen.
*  He was unfair to play it.
*  Let's talk about the other game
*  and whether we believe in Milwaukee Bucks yet.
*  I thought they played really well
*  against the Celtics on Friday
*  in a game that was about as intense as you get in December.
*  There's no love lost between those two teams,
*  Kirk Goldsberry.
*  There's some Yanis Jalen stuff.
*  There's some Yanis Al Horford stuff, I felt like.
*  Tatum has a little bird in a saddle against them.
*  I don't feel like anybody really likes
*  playing against Dame that much.
*  I always feel like people get annoyed by him.
*  But that was a really intense game on Friday.
*  But the Celts won, but what struck me was
*  I thought the Bucks hung with them
*  and could have won the game.
*  And now that Green and Prince
*  have been getting them three point shooting,
*  now that Portis, who looked like he was gonna be
*  out of the league first month of the season,
*  now he's back, now they have Middleton back.
*  Yanis is averaging a 32, 12, and six.
*  I still don't feel like they're at that top echelon
*  maybe not even in the second echelon.
*  But they're at least lingering because of Yanis now, right?
*  Is that, I don't think they're lurking,
*  but I would go lingering for them, is that fair?
*  I think they're 11 and three in their last 14 games
*  after starting two and eight.
*  And what you just said, one of the sort of deep cut takes
*  is like, yeah, AJ Green, Gary Trent,
*  Torrey and Prince, Bobby Portis.
*  They're getting really efficient three point shooting
*  from those dudes.
*  And then Yanis stopped shooting threes.
*  He stopped shooting threes.
*  Today he shot his first three in six games, I think.
*  He shot another one at the end of the game,
*  but he'd gone five games without shooting a three.
*  He's attacking the rim,
*  and then they're surrounding him with shooting.
*  Tonight they played a smaller lineup.
*  They took Brook out and they put these
*  aforementioned shooters.
*  Chris Middleton's back in the lineups.
*  Damian obviously.
*  Spacing starts at the rim.
*  Yanis pressures the rim better than anybody
*  in the league right now, and he can make passes.
*  If they can make those shots, they're very good.
*  The Bucs were always supposed to be this good.
*  The only thing weird was they were two and eight.
*  Do I trust them to be better than the Boston Celtics?
*  No, but it looks like they've righted the ship
*  and look like they're a viable
*  Eastern Conference contender now.
*  Because Yanis is putting up scoring title numbers,
*  and they're getting this three point shooting
*  from the supporting cast, and now they're whole.
*  So they have Chris, Damian, and Yanis.
*  They were supposed to be good.
*  I'm a little worried about the Lopez piece of it.
*  He looked really old in the Celtic game,
*  and I thought he was the biggest reason they lost.
*  And it feels like there's a Yanis, Portis,
*  shooters, and Dame, and whether Middleton's
*  in that or not, we'll find out.
*  But that seems to be probably their most successful lineup,
*  which is weird, because Lopez was so essential
*  with what they did.
*  I don't know, Jacobes.
*  I still don't feel like the Yanis, Dame thing is perfect.
*  And maybe it will never be, but it almost feels like Dame,
*  it's like, hey, Yanis isn't gonna play tonight, Dame.
*  You're gonna have to take a lot of shots.
*  I don't feel like he's shedding tears.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I don't feel like they've totally figured it out yet,
*  but they're kind of scotch taping it
*  and duct taping it together now.
*  Body language doctor doesn't love that duo
*  as much as I wanted to when he signed,
*  but we always, I think people are critical of Dame.
*  It's like, he scores 25.7 points a game
*  and gets 7.5 assists a game.
*  He's like 37% from three now.
*  Is that so bad?
*  Yeah.
*  Is that so bad?
*  What are we being critical of, really?
*  And Derry Bird and Tori and Prince is shooting 54% from three
*  on like 3.6 attempts or something.
*  It's not fake.
*  They're surrounding two of the biggest offensive weapons
*  in the league with shooting.
*  Defensively, ah, ah, we can just pass over that.
*  They're not stopping anybody.
*  It's tough.
*  Yeah, for Tatum, it's a dream.
*  Tatum against the Bucks, he's like, this is awesome.
*  Sorry, Kirk, I interrupted you.
*  No, I was just saying when they were great,
*  when they won it all, they were great on defense.
*  This was a defensive juggernaut too
*  with Brook and Yanis protecting the paint,
*  and then Drew and Chris and the role players
*  all seeming like these younger thunder rockets teams
*  that we're seeing the more like, yeah,
*  they were a great defense and I don't see that happening.
*  And for that reason, I'm out to quote Mark Cuban
*  on their ability to compete with Boston
*  and maybe even Cleveland at the very top
*  of the Eastern Conference.
*  Are you a believer, Eme said this like three weeks ago,
*  about, he's like, if you look at all the teams
*  that have won a title or made the finals,
*  they're all like top five defense.
*  Yeah, I think he's right.
*  I actually think it's that simple.
*  Yeah, and like even tonight, Suggs had Dame in front of him
*  and he dribbled between his legs like four times
*  then just like shot a three.
*  And it was like, Suggs, that's Dame Lillard.
*  Just put your shoulder down and go past him.
*  In a key point, I was really disappointed
*  in that particular possession
*  because I think there's a reason
*  that when Dame is guarding somebody,
*  there's no screener.
*  There's a reason.
*  Right, well then when Dame wasn't on him,
*  he was getting the switch.
*  But they were asking a lot from Suggs in that game.
*  In fact, this is a good time to bring in Steve Cerrutti
*  for two seconds because, so at halftime,
*  were you on Expedia or wherever looking for
*  Hartford to Vegas tickets?
*  Were you thinking about it?
*  You were, weren't you?
*  I definitely was and it was like,
*  I saw Gladiator 2 on Friday
*  and I had really low expectations for it
*  and I really enjoyed it.
*  I liked the movie.
*  I don't know if it needed to be made.
*  It was kind of the same as the first one
*  just with like a new thing.
*  I had really low expectations tonight.
*  Didn't know what to expect.
*  I didn't know if we'd hit 90 points
*  because I'm just, I don't know where the scoring comes from.
*  And then yeah, like that first quarter happens
*  and I'm like, I'm in.
*  This team, they were gonna win the game
*  and like, you get the halftime.
*  They kind of, I think they're down one and a half time
*  but anything's on the table.
*  It just sucked because that Suggs injury
*  in the third quarter, they were,
*  I think down one at the time.
*  He goes out for a couple of minutes
*  and I think he comes back in, they're down eight
*  and they have to climb back the rest of the game
*  to get there but without that,
*  at the end of the day, the guys like,
*  when they're fully healthy,
*  like I think they're capable of beating anybody.
*  They're capable of beating anybody.
*  I'm not saying they'd be favored against any of these teams
*  but they are capable of beating anybody.
*  My friend, Sean Grandy,
*  who is the radio guy for the Celtics,
*  who's I think a good basketball kind of thinker
*  with this stuff, Orlando is the team he's afraid of
*  for the Celtics when they get everybody back
*  because he thinks they're defensive upside.
*  They didn't have Isaac tonight either.
*  He thinks their defensive ceiling is the high,
*  like some people would say it's Tibbs and Nicks
*  but I just think it's gonna be too easy to get point.
*  The Nicks are in a weird position where their offense
*  is probably gonna be more dangerous
*  than their defense in the playoffs
*  but I think Orlando, so the case for them would be
*  the defense giving Frans all those reps without Paolo
*  and now Suggs turning into like Russell Westbrook 2017 light
*  like just doing everything on the magic.
*  Jacobi, you buying Suggs stock yet?
*  I bought a lot of Suggs stock pre-season
*  because of defense.
*  I didn't see this Suggs but it is odd.
*  This is Gonzaga Suggs.
*  It just seems like Paolo's playing so well
*  and then Frans steps up and plays so well
*  and then Frans is out and now Suggs steps up and plays.
*  So if Suggs has a legit hurt hand,
*  it's gonna be like Mo Wagner scores 30 and 12 and 10.
*  It's like what is happening?
*  It just seems like someone on that team
*  is gonna play like an All-Star no matter what happens.
*  Anthony Black is next if Suggs goes down.
*  Yeah, I was nervous.
*  You gotta get some K-tape or whatever.
*  Get his obliques taped up so he can't get,
*  there's some oblique, like epidemic breaking out
*  in Orlando but yeah, when his thumb got hurt,
*  I was like you gotta be kidding me
*  because that's the thing about the NBA Cup is like cool,
*  like this is fun and all
*  but like if we're really gonna lose Suggs
*  for an extended period of time, like pass on the NBA Cup.
*  Well, the other piece with the Orlando
*  that's been interesting with these guys going out is,
*  I don't know, they took the training wheels
*  off Anthony Black a little bit.
*  Yep.
*  He got, what's the hairdo he's rocking these days?
*  He moves some hair stuff around.
*  Yeah, he's got, there's like a little bun in the back.
*  Totally different player, totally different player.
*  I was shocked.
*  Seems like a new guy.
*  Yeah, totally different player.
*  Who's that?
*  Yeah, that's the guy, Anthony Black.
*  But there's a lot of stuff to like with him
*  and I don't really know what his ceiling is
*  and I'm sure when we get to like game four
*  of a playoff series and he's in the corner,
*  teams are gonna be like go ahead, take that
*  but the fact that he's not a bust feels like a win, Saruti.
*  So it was kind of an uncharacteristic game from him.
*  He was weirdly bad defensively tonight.
*  He got lost like a couple of times
*  but he actually scored way more than you'd think he was,
*  had assist rebounds and a lot of that was just like,
*  cause they just need an extra ball handler.
*  I would say too, like I'm not nervous,
*  like the panic meter's not going off,
*  but like $22 million a year, like KCP seven points,
*  kind of hoping for more than that in a situation
*  where you kind of need a veteran to step up.
*  But honestly, like all these young guys,
*  like even just like Tristan Silva,
*  like he started tonight, he started a lot of games
*  since Franz and Paolo have been out and he's been fine.
*  And I really liked the two big lineup,
*  the Wendell playing the four,
*  kind of like it can't really work
*  when they're fully healthy,
*  but in this version of the team without Isaac,
*  he's actually really good at getting those spots,
*  like kind of top of the key, throwing those lob passes,
*  like being a facilitator.
*  I think he had the best plus minus on the Magic tonight.
*  He was awesome.
*  Kirk, what do you see from the Magic?
*  Yes, Rudy should be thrilled, man.
*  I was talking to Vince Carter and Jalen,
*  we were watching this game and we were like, holy crap.
*  Like these guys are going to be a problem.
*  And I'm with Sean Grandy.
*  I don't think anybody wants to play this team
*  in their playoffs.
*  I'm not saying they would beat the Celtics,
*  but they're a pain in the ass to score on.
*  And like Oklahoma City, they're a pain in the ass
*  to pass on and get rebounds on.
*  I love the two big lineup.
*  I love that it's Mo and Goga and Wendell,
*  like they're playing bigger than almost any,
*  De Silva too, when he's at the three, they're just big.
*  And yeah, the biggest point here is they didn't have
*  three or four of their normal rotation pieces.
*  Gary Harris, Jonathan, Isaac, but obviously,
*  Gary Harris.
*  Paolo and Franz, who, you know, Torn Oblique Club,
*  like stand up like, and as a holder of Suggs coin
*  for years now, you guys should be thrilled.
*  I know you didn't get the result tonight,
*  but it looks like you're built for war for a long time
*  and you're the Orlando Magic.
*  You guys should be thrilled.
*  And two games you didn't have to play.
*  It's not like the NBA Cup was good or anything for you.
*  It's two more games where nobody's getting hurt, right?
*  Oh, it's really good time out.
*  Hold on.
*  This is just too much, like too much for me.
*  They don't have a player that can hit a three point shot
*  in 2024.
*  They don't have one.
*  So can we just like address that?
*  They don't have a player that can hit a three point shot.
*  It's tough.
*  They're 30th in a three point shooting, 31%.
*  They're 28th in corner threes.
*  Is that so scared to play?
*  I'm so scared to play them in the playoffs.
*  We're a shooting team in the league.
*  But Paulo Suggs and Franz are all fine.
*  Why'd you have to do that to Saruti?
*  He's got like,
*  especially guys have torn obliques.
*  He's just like fucking shitting on their shooting.
*  No one wants to see this team in the playoffs.
*  Like, I can't shoot.
*  He said their defense is hard.
*  I think those corner threes come from good movement elsewhere.
*  Corner threes are created when their best offensive players
*  are doing other shit somewhere else on the court.
*  Those guys aren't playing,
*  particularly their best offensive player.
*  And now Franz isn't playing.
*  He's also great at offense.
*  So those are like indicator species.
*  Yes, there are three point shooting personnel.
*  Jacoby does lack.
*  KCP is underwhelming.
*  But some of these are sort of byproducts
*  of the offense itself just not having
*  its alpha and beta creators.
*  Oh, I like how he used the alpha and beta.
*  Saruti, did you know where your oblique was five weeks ago?
*  No idea.
*  I thought it was a leg injury.
*  I thought it was like part of your hip.
*  Where did you think it was on your body?
*  I thought it was like an inner quad thing.
*  I don't know.
*  Jacoby, do you know where it was?
*  Yeah, because they're called love handles.
*  That's all you have to do is for us,
*  for athletes, they're called obliques.
*  For us, they're called love handles.
*  That's where they are.
*  They're your love handles.
*  Right above your rib?
*  It's your love handles are your obliques.
*  It's a love handle injury
*  that is sweeping through the magic locker room.
*  Love handles.
*  I wonder if they even knew how to diagnose this
*  in like the eighties.
*  Like Bob McAdoo had a torn oblique for an entire year
*  and had no idea.
*  He was like, my side hurts.
*  They're like, Bob, take some aspirin.
*  Slept eye wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  But how did two guys,
*  I know everyone's asking this,
*  but it is fucking weird.
*  How did two guys get the same injury?
*  It's like a haunted house.
*  We don't understand it.
*  I guess Ferron said he doesn't even know what he did it.
*  He doesn't know at any point in the game.
*  I heard they were showing him different plays
*  and he couldn't even know what the play was.
*  So maybe he doesn't even know
*  where his oblique is either.
*  He's like, what's hurt?
*  Really weird.
*  Rank your three teams you're afraid of in the East.
*  Boston obviously won.
*  Who's two?
*  Cleveland.
*  I guess I'm buying the Milwaukee Coolator.
*  Over the Knicks.
*  Oh, please.
*  Die Easy Knicks fan, Dave Giacobbe is upset.
*  No.
*  And this maybe the number one offense in the league.
*  You just kicked our ass the other night
*  and scared the crap out of me
*  because if we had lost that game by 37,
*  we would have been out of the NBA Cup
*  and that would have been one of the most
*  embarrassing losses of my life.
*  It was very much on the table in the third quarter.
*  And against Tibbs,
*  that's the one guy you don't want to be against.
*  But I don't know.
*  I'm still, I mean, the cat Brunson thing
*  is like incredible offensively right now,
*  but they're not the same team defensively.
*  And I just, I'm a little,
*  I'm a little worried about the playoff thing
*  with the playoff cat defensively.
*  How's that gonna look?
*  What's the Mitchell Robinson minutes?
*  Like, I don't know.
*  I'm just like, I'm with Bill too, the Bridges thing.
*  Listen, we're picking hairs.
*  They're a good team obviously, but I don't know.
*  There's something about this Knicks team
*  I'm not ready to fully go all in on.
*  Kirk, were you seeing 25 and 13
*  with 46% three point shooting from Townes this year?
*  Was that in your bingo card?
*  Dude, yeah, he is incredible.
*  I didn't know that Tom Thibodeau
*  was an offensive genius until this year.
*  I think that they had that.
*  Yeah, I just learned that.
*  25 and 13, I think I would have put him around there.
*  The 45, 46% number from three point is crazy, dude.
*  I thought it was gonna go the other way.
*  I thought it was gonna be like,
*  oh, they gotta figure out how to get the ball more
*  because there haven't been enough.
*  Instead, it's like this him and Brunson as a combo
*  have been crazy.
*  And then it seems like the Knicks fans really like them too.
*  That's the other thing that I think was up in the air.
*  They're gonna get Precious
*  and they're gonna get Mitch Robinson back.
*  And I don't think we've seen
*  what their defense really could be.
*  But I'm with Saruti.
*  I definitely go Celtics, Cavs, Knicks.
*  Then I go Bucks.
*  But I do think the Knicks offense deserves respect.
*  They can score against anybody in a variety of ways.
*  It's just like their shooting is great.
*  And then Brunson and Catt.
*  I do love the geometry,
*  to borrow Jaylen's basketball geometry phrase.
*  I love what the Knicks have spacing the court right now.
*  Yeah, I think I'd go slight edge to the Bucks
*  because of just how crazy Giannis is this year.
*  It just seems like anytime he wants to go downhill,
*  so my daughter went to the game on Friday
*  because my dad got a COVID shot.
*  First of all, why did he get a COVID shot?
*  Great question.
*  What?
*  What?
*  What?
*  In the year 2024?
*  I don't know.
*  Did he get injected with COVID?
*  Is that the COVID shot now?
*  How did it work?
*  I was like, dad, it's 2024.
*  What are you doing?
*  So he got a COVID shot.
*  And then go figure,
*  him and my stepmom both felt like crap the next day.
*  So my daughter got to go to their boyfriend
*  and she hadn't seen Giannis in person.
*  And it was, so she called me after and she was like,
*  dad, is he like the best player of all time?
*  Like, where does he, what's going on with that?
*  It just seems like every time he wants,
*  he could just bulldoze over everybody
*  and get a layup or a dunk.
*  And I'm like, yeah, it's kind of who he is.
*  No, it's this fat guy from Serbia, actually.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  It's this fat guy.
*  This fat guy's gonna have 104 points this weekend,
*  two games.
*  But I think we've been watching the Yadavs' thing
*  for so long, we forget just fundamentally how insane it is
*  that he could just basically get to wherever he wants
*  no matter what the defense is.
*  Middleton is the thing with them.
*  To me, it's a 3A, 3B thing.
*  And I want to know where we are with Middleton in March.
*  And then Orlando's kind of lurking as the who knows team.
*  Miami, it's interesting.
*  And I don't think they have any chance
*  to move up into this ladder,
*  but they do seem like they've figured out something
*  over the last two weeks with their team.
*  Like, Kero carries the offense for three quarters.
*  Butler kind of takes over late.
*  Bams having a really weird season,
*  like all his field goal stuff
*  and stuff around the rim is terrible.
*  It's really like uncharacteristic.
*  But for some reason, I could see them
*  maybe upsetting somebody in one round,
*  but not more than that.
*  And that's really it.
*  I don't even know who else we would have in the East.
*  Surti, you seem serenely confident.
*  Just focused on March and April.
*  It just sucked.
*  The Frans injury sucks because it takes away
*  the potential All-Star, the potential most improved.
*  All that stuff is kind of not there anymore.
*  Well, it took away the super max though,
*  which is good for you.
*  I guess that could have been a salary cap nightmare
*  to have two super max guys.
*  Speaking of contracts, I need to say this.
*  To the people who this summer were criticizing
*  the Jalen Suggs DOL,
*  what was it, five years, $150 million
*  for a guy that scores 12 points a game.
*  Who criticized that?
*  People did.
*  Who's that?
*  People?
*  Yes, yes.
*  A lot of our friends from the border,
*  maybe some Raptors fans who are still a little upset
*  about how that draft.
*  By the way, the 2021 draft is my favorite draft
*  in recent history.
*  It's incredible.
*  Go down the list of just, every week,
*  I feel like you change the order of what guys you want.
*  Obviously, Frans Suggs, what have we got?
*  Cade, Mobley, Shenkoon, Jalen Green, Barnes.
*  Jalen Johnson was in that draft.
*  Unbelievable draft.
*  Pay Suggs, the man's worth the money.
*  He's one of the best winners in the league.
*  He does things that other guys,
*  he is the ultimate winning player
*  and whatever you need him to do,
*  and you saw it tonight.
*  He doesn't need to be a 30-point a game scorer,
*  but he was tonight.
*  I think he's a third guy on a championship team,
*  and maybe even potentially has the ceiling
*  of being a second guy if he was with somebody incredible.
*  Like being the Jamal Murray drew holiday spot
*  if you get to play next to a Janis or Jokic.
*  All right, thanks for stopping in, Saruti.
*  Thanks, guys.
*  Appreciate you, Saruti.
*  Congrats on your heroic effort tonight.
*  Yeah, hopefully we see you in April, May.
*  Before we go, Jacobi, you wanna talk about Embiid?
*  I do.
*  What do you got?
*  What the fuck is going on?
*  Just like, what is going on?
*  My questions for you, Bill, are what is the plan?
*  Do his teammates like him?
*  And all I hear about is like how little he communicates
*  with the team about his availability,
*  how he's late all the time.
*  Like, Verno knew some guy who said he missed the team buses
*  like the day after the report came out that he was late.
*  It's just all like he's become, in the last three years,
*  he's turned from one of the most likable stars in the league
*  to someone who I like less and less and less
*  every three months.
*  And we're there right now.
*  So here's why I've landed, Goldsberry.
*  To me, remember we said that joke about Twitter,
*  like when Twitter was really like a place
*  a lot of people went to that you just wish
*  you could have certain stories and just not even see them?
*  That you could meet the story.
*  If the story was happening, you just wouldn't even know
*  about it.
*  That's how I feel about Embiid might play tonight.
*  Embiid's not gonna play tonight.
*  Embiid's gonna rest tonight.
*  Embiid has some swelling again.
*  Embiid's feeling better.
*  I just, I'm just out.
*  I'm tapping out.
*  I can't do it.
*  The chronic swelling was the most disturbing part
*  of that story I thought this weekend.
*  It's not even like he re-injured or anything.
*  It was like, yeah, it's maintenance
*  because he has chronic swelling.
*  What does chronic swelling mean?
*  None of it sounds good.
*  Goldsberry, you were at San Antonio
*  when this was going on with Kawhi.
*  It was a little different.
*  There was more mystery and Kawhi was younger.
*  He wasn't seven foot three carrying a bunch of weight,
*  but this just has a stranglehold over your franchise
*  after a certain point, right?
*  Yeah, that's a perfect word.
*  It really is just like a black cloud or a stranglehold.
*  I'd actually compare it to Tim.
*  A lot of people forget that Tim Duncan had a really bad knee
*  his entire career.
*  And the scourge that is known as load management
*  has a lot to do with Tim Duncan's knee
*  and Greg Popovich and the staff really making sure
*  that they could get everything.
*  But that also meant that Tim had to be very serious
*  about his nutrition and his sleep and all this other stuff.
*  And I think as Joel enters sort of the later stage
*  of his career, if he wants to keep playing at this level,
*  he has to be more serious, more professional,
*  not just about being on time to the bus,
*  but taking care of his body.
*  The reason LeBron is LeBron at this age
*  is because he was really careful about his body
*  and respected that stuff.
*  And unfortunately, this is what it looks like
*  when somebody doesn't do that kind of thing, in my opinion.
*  And I'm not quite sure where this is going.
*  I do think Philadelphia has reasons to be more optimistic
*  than the last time we talked about these guys
*  on the podcast.
*  I still think the East, what we just went through
*  is like, oh, maybe Miami's the five seed.
*  Unfortunately, there needs to be eight playoff teams
*  in the Eastern Conference.
*  And I think Philadelphia will get one of those slots.
*  And so I think they could be pretty patient here.
*  I just agree with what you guys are saying.
*  This is really troubling, like the lack of communication,
*  the lack of clarity, the weird Timmy Bond temps quotes
*  from this week, it's depressing,
*  I don't even know it's injured, it's just inflammation.
*  These are bad signs, guys.
*  That said-
*  You just happened to have a Celtics in 09 with KG,
*  I don't know if you remember.
*  KG got hurt.
*  They were like 31 and five, they had some crazy record.
*  And it was like, KG's coming back,
*  and then it was just, is he coming back?
*  And then it was like, team not sure, still feeling pain,
*  nobody's saying anything, and it just turns into this,
*  that like you said, a black cloud,
*  where you don't know game to game we tweak.
*  What's weird is that, I guess he looked pretty good
*  in that bowls game, I didn't watch it,
*  I just saw the highlights.
*  I watched the game, it was weird.
*  He started out terrible.
*  He was like 0 for seven or something,
*  it was like, and everything was short,
*  like that Memphis game was the same thing,
*  where everything was short, and he has this brace,
*  like his full leg brace on,
*  and then he started to get warmed up,
*  and they're spamming this,
*  they're spamming this high pick and roll with him and Maxey,
*  and Maxey would just give him a pocket pass,
*  and he would just shoot from like 16 feet,
*  and Busevich just didn't do anything about it,
*  and even if Busevich was on him,
*  he would just jab step and then shoot over him,
*  and he was like, I don't have the numbers for him,
*  he's like eight for 10 from like around the foul line,
*  which is where, in my opinion, when he was best,
*  when actually Doc was coaching,
*  he would just like operate from the foul line,
*  but he would do a lot of distributing and like driving,
*  but they really, it's just like,
*  it got to the point where in the third quarter,
*  he was just absolutely wet from the mid-range.
*  Like he scored like a ton of points
*  after starting over seven,
*  looking like he might as well just like go back on the bench.
*  Yeah, it's like when you see, like in a sports movie,
*  there's like the fat old washed up guy
*  who wanders on the court and just starts hitting
*  like 20 footers.
*  It just seems like a bead.
*  He's so skilled from 18, 19 feet, it doesn't matter.
*  They had him play for a month,
*  all of a sudden he could just hit nine straight 20 footers,
*  but you know, not to be a party pooper,
*  but you know, they're in this stretch.
*  They were calling it, Hollinger called it the NBA bye week,
*  basically, where everybody has like one or two games
*  over the course of eight days,
*  and they're playing Chicago, then they have all this rest.
*  So he can have a game, he's playing Busevich,
*  he's playing the Bulls who are bottom five defensive team,
*  and he can go out there, get a good run, get his points,
*  not have to worry about playing the next day.
*  It's hard to feel optimistic after that is my point.
*  Like I wanna see what their schedule starts to get harder,
*  I think at the end of the year,
*  they've got, did they have a road trip?
*  Is he gonna be on the road trip?
*  Is he gonna play?
*  Then there's the part that you mentioned
*  about the teammates being asked about it.
*  What do you think about Joelle?
*  How much do you guys miss Joelle?
*  It's just day after day, and it's not awesome,
*  especially when you're competing against teams like OKC,
*  where it's like everybody's young and hungry,
*  and they're all doing the post-game press conferences
*  together, and they're hanging out, they're ready to go.
*  So I don't know how it plays out.
*  I'll tell you this though, the extension.
*  Yeah.
*  That's just so, wow.
*  No, that is a very debilitating contract,
*  and we talked about this earlier.
*  It's like you don't see a lot of good teams
*  with this new cap bill with any bad contracts,
*  let alone a max contract with a guy
*  who's not playing at that level.
*  That hasn't even kicked in from the extension part yet.
*  100%.
*  It's like how do you build a team
*  when you have that much sort of money locked up
*  in a player that may or may not even be able
*  to play most nights?
*  Chikobi, who's your favorite rookie?
*  My favorite rookie?
*  Yeah.
*  In terms of to watch or I would want on my team.
*  Because my favorite rookie is obviously Jared McCain,
*  just as a vibe.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Because he's so much fun and just sort of
*  sew himself off the court.
*  But I am also on Risa Shay Island.
*  I wish he made threes.
*  He's like 28% from three, but everything else is there.
*  He's like 20.
*  Fluid, I know.
*  That team of Johnson, Daniels, Risa Shay,
*  it's like, Trey or no Trey, that is a core
*  that I really, really like.
*  I'm much higher in Atlanta than I should be,
*  and I'll admit that, but I feel the same about Risa Shay.
*  I've watched, he had a huge game,
*  I forget who he was against, he was early in the season,
*  he had 30 points or something.
*  I was like, this dude looks like a number one pick
*  in the NBA draft.
*  He's good, he knows what he's doing.
*  I had over bets for them before the season.
*  When I was in Denver last week, I doubled down,
*  because the over was still too low.
*  Because I think that's an over 500 team.
*  I think my favorite rookie is Castle.
*  Yes.
*  Good one.
*  For what he's gonna do, I think this year,
*  I think they're gonna have real trouble
*  keeping him out of the lineup, and there's a chance
*  he's their second best player by the end of the year.
*  I just like him, I like how hard he plays.
*  He seems like the kind of guy O.K.C. would have.
*  Just a really, really, really gives a shit two way guy.
*  He can't really shoot yet, but I thought he was
*  my favorite guy heading into the draft.
*  I thought he's the guy I would have taken number one
*  if I was Atlanta, and everything I've seen from him,
*  I would not waver on that one.
*  I wanna see more, Reed Shepard is the one
*  I think I'm the most interested by,
*  because I don't think Van Vliet's had a good season,
*  and the shooting stats back it up, they're not good.
*  And I wonder, I know they have, I forget if it's
*  a player option or a team option next year,
*  Reed Shepard within two years will probably be
*  running that team, but I almost, that's one of those
*  where you want Van Vliet to have some very minor injury
*  for three days or three games, just to kind of see
*  Reed Shepard get to drive the car out of the garage
*  a couple times.
*  He's one, it's weird, I like this draft more
*  than I thought Kirk.
*  There's a lot of guys, they're not superstars,
*  but there's a lot of guys where I'm like,
*  I kinda like that guy.
*  Even Klingon on Portland, I like Zach Eady,
*  there's a bunch of them.
*  I'm gonna come back to you on Eady,
*  because I need to know how the surf has been
*  over at Eady Island, if the seawalls are holding up.
*  But I wanna know, yeah, Steven Castle is the answer
*  for me, and it's not close, and I'm obviously close
*  to the Spurs, they are very excited about all the stuff
*  he does, I love the description of a thunder-like player,
*  he is that kind of dog in him stereotype,
*  but he does the stuff that doesn't show up
*  in the box score, they love this guy,
*  he's adding sort of an edge to their group.
*  I think Jeremy Sohan is kinda like that too,
*  and I think it could help them,
*  they're destined to build a great defense in San Antonio,
*  and I think he could be part of that.
*  Like Lou Dort, another potentially great defender,
*  he needed to get a shot, and Louis figured that out,
*  so I feel like Castle could get a little of that.
*  Dalton Connect obviously needs to be mentioned,
*  I know he's older, but I think he's been fantastic,
*  given where they got him in the draft,
*  I'm still on Richochet Island, I'm not giving up
*  on that anytime soon, but for me, I'll say Reid Shepard
*  I think is gonna be great in this league for a long time,
*  but I'm going Castle, he's really won me over
*  in the last few weeks specifically, but tell me, Bill,
*  Zach Eady, was he everything you dreamed of,
*  or are you a little bit let down at this point in the season?
*  Well, I think Memphis is so deep,
*  I thought he would actually be this important, weird,
*  just kind of throw a cannonball in the pool
*  just to shake it up kind of thing, but they don't need it,
*  they just have too many good bench guys,
*  their bench is crazy, and the fact that
*  Al Dahma is actually good now.
*  Huff and Aldama, yeah, you can't take mids away
*  from Huff and Aldama, what are you crazy?
*  No, those guys are just-
*  He's also not available right now,
*  we haven't seen him too much.
*  Yeah, true.
*  Yeah, Sar, that's probably the worst possible situation
*  for a guy like that, it's like your team's gonna just
*  be awful and you're just gonna learn some bad habits,
*  but too early to say what we talk about him.
*  I mean, one other thing with Memphis,
*  another reason that Eady's probably not even gonna play
*  that much is that Brandon Clark has,
*  I was so impressed with him in the Boston game,
*  but just it feels like he's got his explosiveness back,
*  and he's a really unique player,
*  like that crazy undersized energy guy
*  that always seems to be on good teams,
*  so yeah, I like the draft.
*  We'll see with Dillingham, that was the other one
*  I was super duper intrigued by,
*  but it feels like they phased him out a little bit
*  because they're trying to get their defense going.
*  So we'll see what happens with that.
*  Who's your most disappointing team, Jacoby, Indiana?
*  Oh, I mean, you're leading the witness,
*  so I'm gonna try to go with another team.
*  You're gonna zag on me?
*  That's fine.
*  I'm trying to, but I mean, obviously,
*  the most disappointing team is the Sixers,
*  but I think there's a reason for that,
*  just availability, like I think the Sixers,
*  I think the Sixers will turn around
*  and end up being a playoff team.
*  Let's not forget they were in the play-in last year
*  and ended up in a really good series against the Knicks,
*  but it has to be the Pacers and Halliburton.
*  And remember this time last year,
*  during the in-season tournament, it was called at the time,
*  they were the bell of the ball,
*  and Halliburton was this rising superstar.
*  They put him in this stupid commercial with Rosario Dawson,
*  and he's not even a factor whatsoever,
*  and his home road stuff is really strange.
*  I don't think I've seen anything like that,
*  but yeah, I would say the Pacers,
*  because the expectations were at a point
*  that they're just not reaching.
*  It's probably Tommy Elter's fault.
*  Who's your most disappointing team, Kirk?
*  Oh, this one's for Chris Vernon, the Memphis Grizzlies.
*  I've been very disappointed.
*  What do you, no, no.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  He fast forwarded, he didn't hear it.
*  Yeah, that's right, that's right.
*  I would say the Minnesota Timberwolves,
*  because I thought, I hand up,
*  I thought the Randall trade was good.
*  Dante DiVincenzo too, it hasn't worked.
*  It has not worked.
*  They went from having a very strong identity
*  with great defense and good offense,
*  to not really having an identity,
*  and looking like a middle of pack team
*  in the Western Conference,
*  when most of us thought they were going up a level,
*  not down a level in this exact season, Bill.
*  So for me, I think the Pacers have a very strong claim
*  to this conference finalists,
*  but I will say Minnesota,
*  because I really want Anthony Edwards
*  to be the face of American superstars
*  in the next five, 10 years.
*  I love everything about him.
*  So I've been particularly disappointed
*  with that team's performance after what they did last year.
*  Those are two great choices.
*  Congratulations to both of you,
*  but the answer is the Phoenix Suns.
*  They don't have KD.
*  Okay. What do you want them to do?
*  Yeah. They don't have KD.
*  Make excuses for Big Shot Bob Sarver.
*  They're 13 and 11.
*  They're like one in nine without KD.
*  Okay, but guess what?
*  They traded all their first round picks.
*  They traded McHale Bridges.
*  They traded Cam Johnson.
*  They traded DeAndre Ayton.
*  They traded all their second round picks.
*  They traded everything to have basically a three-guy team,
*  and one of the three guys has been in the league since 2007
*  and has a bunch of injuries and has gotten hurt twice.
*  And I don't know why I fell for it.
*  It made me mad.
*  They were one of my favorite overs.
*  I picked them to win the division.
*  I thought they were gonna be a 50-plus win team,
*  and I forgot the fact that they're built around this guy
*  who's been in the league for 18 years,
*  asking him to be the rim protector,
*  their crunch time scorer,
*  do 30 a game, nine rebounds a game,
*  make 50% of your shots and 45% of your threes,
*  do everything.
*  And it's like, oh, guess what?
*  He lasted a month before he got hurt twice.
*  And I'm just mad at myself more than anything.
*  But you have to be disappointing when you trade
*  literally a decade of stuff for the team you have
*  in your 13 and 11.
*  So that's my answer.
*  Herb's not it.
*  When they made the Beale trade, were you like,
*  that's great?
*  Well, no one liked that trade.
*  Yeah, especially now with all the apron stuff that happened,
*  that trade looks even 100 times worse.
*  You would much rather have the flexibility now.
*  But when you just consider all the assets they sent out
*  for the team that they have now,
*  and it's all hinging on, well, when Durant's healthy,
*  might not happen.
*  He's seven foot one, and he's had a lot of lower,
*  below the hip injuries at this point.
*  And they put a huge burden on him and play in big minutes.
*  And I would just be nervous if I was a sense.
*  Counterpoint.
*  Yeah, I could see it.
*  You can go first, Joe.
*  Oops.
*  You don't want to draw them in the first round
*  of the playoffs.
*  Because let's imagine that KD plays well, gets back.
*  They're going to climb in the standings.
*  Right now, I think they're 10th or whatever.
*  They're going to climb in the standings.
*  And then you see them in the first round,
*  and you're like, man, Booker and KD can get on a heater.
*  It feels a little bit like, they're basically the Sixers.
*  But Counter, doesn't everybody have two good guys
*  at this point?
*  No.
*  No, the Rockets have zero.
*  They're one of the best teams in the league.
*  But they can play defense, though.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess for me, Kirk, with Phoenix,
*  there's always going to be, now that Nurkic is pretty much
*  unplayable, so leaning on Plumlee now as their center,
*  and Tias Jones, these are bench guys.
*  These are guys that would be 10th or 11th players
*  on the Celtics or the Thunder.
*  And these are two of their crunch time guys.
*  Yeah, it goes back to our theme earlier.
*  It's like, there's not a lot of old and overpaid great teams
*  in the NBA right now.
*  And they're best players older, as you pointed out.
*  Devin Booker's certainly not old.
*  I'm not mad at his contract.
*  The Beal deal, to me, sticks out like a sore thumb
*  on their cap sheet.
*  Nurk, you have to have pretty much a perfect roster.
*  And I kind of agree with you.
*  Doesn't everybody have at least one superstar
*  that we're talking about winning at all?
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  I think that is fair.
*  And to me, the differentiating stuff is now lower down
*  on your depth chart.
*  And that's where this team is just really not right.
*  And I don't think they'll ever be able to play defense
*  well enough to keep up with the top teams in the West.
*  But I keep going back to that Bradley Beal decision,
*  because that was a lot of depth they traded, essentially,
*  for one other player that might have sort of
*  a repetitive role next to Devin and Kevin.
*  70 plus million for Bradley Beal and Nurkage and BowBowl.
*  Is BowBowl still on the team?
*  Yeah.
*  That smells like new owner decisions.
*  Guys, thanks for staying up with me.
*  It's a pleasure seeing you.
*  Great seeing you in your weird, undisclosed
*  New York City location at one in the morning.
*  I don't know where you are.
*  Be careful walking home, Jacobes.
*  Kirk, great to see you.
*  Even though we were your sloppy seconds tonight,
*  I had a great time talking to you guys.
*  I will see you soon, I'm sure.
*  Thanks for coming up.
