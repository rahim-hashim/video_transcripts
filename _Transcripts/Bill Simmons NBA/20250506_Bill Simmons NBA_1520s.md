# Is It Panic Time for the Celtics? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU)
*  I want to talk about the Celtics first, but which team is should be more panicked right now Celtics are okay see in your opinion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=0.0s)]
*  I [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=7.32s)]
*  I don't think either. Okay. Let's be clear. I don't think either should be panicked [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=9.6s)]
*  I'm going to say Celtics should be a little more worried only because the Hauser [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=14.68s)]
*  Injury, we don't you know, he turned his ankle or whatever and he's been a zero so far in the playoffs and the porzingis [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=21.04s)]
*  Weirdness just keeps right on rolling. Like I don't it this has been a strange season [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=27.66s)]
*  He didn't play the second half. He has an illness again [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=33.66s)]
*  And so you take those two guys and put question marks beside them for game two and you're just sort of running low on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=37.1s)]
*  Guys, so I don't think either should be all that worried dog. I guess I'll [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=43.74s)]
*  Inflict you with a little more panic and say the Celtics [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=48.42s)]
*  So the case for the Celtics is what you laid out specifically the porzingis piece [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=51.82s)]
*  Because you go into this series and you go. All right. Am I getting a healthy or relatively healthy porzingis? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=57.26s)]
*  I know I'm getting a healthy Sam Hauser. Well, he gets hurt and then what am I getting from Jalen? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=63.02s)]
*  Where is he? And then also how much am I getting from Drew because Drew had this hamstring? Well, Drew actually looked I thought really good [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=67.78s)]
*  He seems healthy porzingis looked terrible in the first quarter like alarming like texting people like what's going on porzingis? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=75.42s)]
*  Then we never see him again and he has this mystery illness that I've never gotten a real answer for what it is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=82.48s)]
*  And then they lose Hauser too. So all of a sudden now you're basically down to six guys [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=88.28s)]
*  the counter would be they got every shot they wanted for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=93.48s)]
*  45 minutes basically, right they they missed a record amount of threes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=97.8s)]
*  Nobody has ever missed 41 threes in a playoff game. They missed 45 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=102.2s)]
*  There was some crazy stats this morning about how open those threes were how lost towns looked [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=106.12s)]
*  Under defensive rotations. So I'm sure Mazula is like look we just this is gonna happen sometimes we're gonna miss shots [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=112.6s)]
*  Can't we can't panic don't change who we are with that said I hated the last couple tatum shots in regulation [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=120.36s)]
*  That to me that's the worst of the celtics when they're just settling they're playing with their food [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=127.24s)]
*  They're letting the shot clock go down and they're not attacking a team that just doesn't have rim protection and there's specifically that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=132.12s)]
*  That last position with what 20 seconds left? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=139.16s)]
*  Tatum's diddling around the top. He gets Robinson. I'm dealing diddling. He's diddling in the top [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  Gets down to seven seconds. It's wide open. All he's doing is go by Mitchell Robinson [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=149.16s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he can do that and he's going to be able to get to the rim and kick out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=153.16s)]
*  He doesn't do either and he settles for this 28 footer [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=156.52s)]
*  Misses it and then Brunson should have won the game and he missed. Oh my god makes all the time [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=159.56s)]
*  I couldn't believe it missed that shot. I I screamed in my seat that he when he missed that shot out of pure shock [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=163.72s)]
*  Yeah, I highlighted. I mean look what were they 15 of 60? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=169.56s)]
*  um [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=173.48s)]
*  I highlighted there were [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=174.44s)]
*  Several that I just thought were lazy settle shots three that I I highlighted in particular were that one at the end of regulation [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=177.16s)]
*  Over Mitchell Robinson. We're like just just go to the basket [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=183.96s)]
*  Tie game like get fouled go to the basket nine good things can happen [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=187.08s)]
*  One bad thing can happen is you take a step back against the seven footer [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=191.08s)]
*  Uh, Derek White had one in the middle of the third quarter where he drew Brunson on a switch and just kind of dribbled around [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  And hoisted a three from the top of the arc and missed and it's like cool like it's Brunson [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  I get it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  You're hunting Brunson [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=206.84s)]
*  But hunt with the right guys and Tatum's in one corner and Jalen's in another corner doing nothing the entire possession [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=207.72s)]
*  Just sort of an aimless one and then I thought late in the game [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=213.32s)]
*  They missed the three got an offensive rebound and drew [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=216.28s)]
*  Jack that left corner three that just felt rushed to me like just to settle settle like you don't you're I know [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  You're behind at that point. I can't remember what the margin was but like there's three and a half minutes left like this crazy [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=224.52s)]
*  left corner three [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=229.56s)]
*  Tough angle right off and off as the rebound so there were a few of those for sure [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  well and the Knicks succeeded because [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=235.08s)]
*  They got the game in the last five minutes, which is where you want to be against the Celtics in a close game [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=237.56s)]
*  Because they're they might get low three happy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=241.8s)]
*  And their five guys looked really good together down the stretch except for towns on defense [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=244.68s)]
*  Who just seemed lost for most of the game, but I thought that was the best [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=249.16000000000003s)]
*  An Anoby [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=254.2s)]
*  Certainly against the Celtics game one of the better games i've seen him play and and you know [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=255.64s)]
*  The reality is he was the best wing in the game [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=261.0s)]
*  I mean, I thought he was first Tatum and brown like he was easily the best guy out of those four [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  I thought he was the best player in the game if you want to say brunson because of the late game threes over Horford fine [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=269.64s)]
*  An Anoby made every shot they needed him to make and defensively [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=275.96s)]
*  He was like everywhere and I tweeted this after the game last night [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=279.82s)]
*  You know look the shooting luck is obviously huge and the numbers buried out this morning [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=283.82s)]
*  This is the the Knicks were lucky that boston missed so many threes and so many good threes [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=287.5s)]
*  But it on maybe so they missed 45 threes on maybe like eight to ten of them [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=291.82s)]
*  Or or even shots that didn't become threes the combination of an Anoby [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=297.9s)]
*  And bridges with a little bit of heart just kind of shading into the paint [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=303.98s)]
*  helping recovering making Tatum and brown like see arms and bodies and then there are like three or four plays where [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  There was one in particular i'm thinking of where Tatum had the ball on a mismatch up top [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=316.22s)]
*  I know Jalen had the ball on a mismatch up top [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=320.14s)]
*  And it obies on Tatum on the right wing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=323.1s)]
*  He begins to slide over toward the middle of the floor to show Jalen another body and then bridges [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=325.5s)]
*  I think has to zone up between Tatum on the wing and Derek white in the corner and that's when like boston has you you're [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=330.94s)]
*  Dead there's so much shooting there. Uh brown kicks the ball to Tatum [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=337.74s)]
*  Ananoby like rushes in his furious closeout bridges like stunts a little bit off Derek white [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=341.64s)]
*  So they run Tatum off the first three Tatum hits white correct pass in the right corner [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  White decides i'm going to back door cut and drive this into the lane instead of taking a three [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=352.94s)]
*  Miss is a pretty tough layup [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  Like it's a shot he should make but it's at least tough and like those are the margins that the nicks are playing with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  When they help like that and they helped really well and it's a great battle against a great offense and they won enough of them [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  Last night some of it was good nicks defense, but the more I rewatched a lot of the mysteries this morning [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  I looked at the tracking data numbers [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=377.1s)]
*  Um, I think luck definitely outweighs nicks great defense in terms of like why the deseltics miss all those threes [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=379.5s)]
*  They also shot badly from two as well. They didn't shoot well from anywhere. Yeah, dan greenberg had a he had a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=386.94s)]
*  A post with four photos of layups the celtics missed where you just look at here like especially that jaylen brian left [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=393.9s)]
*  jaylen brown lefty [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=400.38s)]
*  The holiday layup under the basket they had a couple of those [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=402.06s)]
*  Chris forzberg had the nba tracking [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=405.42s)]
*  56 at boston 63 pointers [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=408.52s)]
*  And the nicks were open or better which means you have at least four plus feet of space [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=411.26s)]
*  Right. So they're they shot, uh [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=417.34s)]
*  On wide open threes. There were seven for 24. Usually they're 41 on those and then on the open threes [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  They were seven for 32 which was [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=425.74s)]
*  22 percent so mizzou is going to look at all that stuff and say [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=428.14s)]
*  We always make those shots. We're fine [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=432.7s)]
*  The the thing the nicks did to them a few times, especially as it got into nut crunch time [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=435.02s)]
*  They were scrambling. They were at shots late at the shot clock [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=440.46s)]
*  um [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=444.06s)]
*  shots shot clock exploration plays and uh [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=445.02s)]
*  That was about as frazzled as i've seen the celtics from a crunch time thing that I think a big piece of it [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=449.02s)]
*  We just gotta be transparent like jaylen's not the jaylen from last playoffs. He's not as athletic and as uh [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=454.78s)]
*  Kind of run you over as he as he was last year like at the the the jaylen in the dallas series last year [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=463.02s)]
*  It's a different version of him. He's clearly not 100 percent and he was I thought bad last night [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=469.9s)]
*  Uh, and he couldn't make a three and I just think he was easily out of all the wings plus heart. He was the fifth [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=474.78s)]
*  I think the fifth out of those five guys and that's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=481.58s)]
*  Almost more alarming to me than poor zingas because this is this is the level he's going to be at with his knee [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=485.18s)]
*  The next half a chance in the series [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=490.46s)]
*  Ironically, he looked okay playing bully ball in the paint [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=493.08s)]
*  Like it wasn't as early for him as it had been but the three's like one of ten from three [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=497.34000000000003s)]
*  He says he's had the same lift right a lot of them were short [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=502.3s)]
*  Yeah, like it's just like kind of it's like when kawaii doesn't seem like he's 100 healthy and all of a sudden his lift just [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=505.82000000000005s)]
*  Drops by a whiff so that part where his main then the poor zingas piece they've been dealing with this all year put 42 games [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=512.86s)]
*  And it's been a question [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=519.4200000000001s)]
*  All year is he going to show up in what version are we getting he did not look good other than I think one [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=521.5s)]
*  defensive game against orlando [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=525.82s)]
*  Uh, I did not think he looked good in that orlando series and he was awful last night like like as we discussed [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=528.22s)]
*  So it feels like he's missed every three in the playoffs for the I mean, I know he's made some against orlando [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=534.1400000000001s)]
*  But he's not shooting well, I I want to mention one thing you mentioned end of shock lock possessions that the celtics had [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=539.5s)]
*  Um two things on that number one [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=545.82s)]
*  We all know what you're doing on every possession [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=548.7s)]
*  You're finding cat and you're finding brunson and you're putting one or both of them in actions that bring them into contact with tatum and brown [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=551.42s)]
*  And they're cool set plays and all that we all know what you're doing [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=557.9s)]
*  You know what you're doing the nicks know what you're doing the fans know what you're doing [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=560.38s)]
*  Lucky the leprechaun knows what you're doing [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=563.18s)]
*  Can you just start doing it before there's 12 seconds on the shot clock like just too many possessions? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=565.42s)]
*  They just fritter away the first half of the shot clock the more time you have when you start that first action [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=570.78s)]
*  The more chances you give the nicks to make mistakes or miss a rotation or whatever and the second thing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=576.62s)]
*  I want to give the nicks a lot of credit when you get into scramble mode and the celtics will put you into [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=581.5799999999999s)]
*  Scramble mode whether you're switching not switching and the nicks switch a lot more last night [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=586.3s)]
*  Your entire goal as a defense becomes just make the offense make one more pass make one more play [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=590.2199999999999s)]
*  And yeah [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=597.02s)]
*  sometimes that led to they make another play and another play and another play and it's a pretty good layup that the celtics happen to [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=597.5s)]
*  bonk or [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=603.18s)]
*  Sometimes it's a a flyby where the first three they have to pump fake and wait for you to fly by and then they shoot [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=604.06s)]
*  Another one and their rhythm is okay [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=609.3399999999999s)]
*  But not quite the same and they got lucky on the celtics missing a lot of those shots [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=610.8599999999999s)]
*  But they made the celtics make one more play and two more plays a lot [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=614.6999999999999s)]
*  Particularly late in the game and you got you got to give them credit for that was they were flying [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  flying on defense well, and we didn't mention josh heart yet in in the right way because I thought [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=622.78s)]
*  the uh [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=628.78s)]
*  Hmm [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=630.6199999999999s)]
*  My battery saver just went on what's going on. This is a lot of live youtube drama here. Yeah. Oh my god [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=632.62s)]
*  Am I gonna have to carry this solo just just fill in start doing so so tap dancing. What's going on here? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=639.02s)]
*  uh [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=644.62s)]
*  Josh hard as they were coming back [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=645.42s)]
*  I just thought he was everywhere and even it said he only had 11 rebounds [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=648.78s)]
*  It felt like he had his hands on 28 of them [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=653.1s)]
*  And it just felt like he was always tipping stuff or he was around or he [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=656.0600000000001s)]
*  You know just was in the mix over and over and over and over again [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=660.14s)]
*  and I thought he was the celtics it was a set they were up 17 and I think they were like [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=664.62s)]
*  Seven for 30 from three or something terrible and it's like man [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=670.86s)]
*  If we're up 17 shooting like this, this is going to be a really short series [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=674.7800000000001s)]
*  And then I thought heart and an anoby specifically [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=679.4200000000001s)]
*  Kind of took control of that comeback and then brunson did the rest and we even talk about [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=682.94s)]
*  Those three those threes brunson made you could hear that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=687.4200000000001s)]
*  That sound the crowd makes that uh-oh sound like oh boy [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=690.62s)]
*  You know which is reserved for a rare small collection of players [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=694.7800000000001s)]
*  And once he got into that sound you could feel it you could feel like oh, this is bad [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=699.5s)]
*  How how annoyed were you you personally? I just mean you personally how not me you [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=704.1400000000001s)]
*  Reggie miller is just cackling delight over how much he loves jalen brunson and jalen brunson's the best closer in the game the beth force [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=709.58s)]
*  Could they got the like 10 times? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=715.82s)]
*  He called him the best fourth quarter player in the game the collection award winner like I could and I could feel you like [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=718.22s)]
*  Okay, reggie. We get it. We you love him. You love him. We get it. I like I like brunson [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=723.9000000000001s)]
*  Uh, it's he's a hard definitely a hard guy to root against because he's such an overachiever [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=729.4200000000001s)]
*  But when I hear that i'm just like yokage is in the league [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=733.98s)]
*  We can't just hand somebody [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=738.5400000000001s)]
*  It's as this person is the best person at the end of the game when yokage is at the level he's at right now [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=740.6999999999999s)]
*  If you and ironically, okay [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=746.62s)]
*  So he was the next game and it's like i'm pretty sure yokage is just as good in the clutch [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=748.3s)]
*  And I feel like he's gonna make the right decision every time too. Can I talk about josh hart real quickly since you brought him up? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=752.38s)]
*  um [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=759.0999999999999s)]
*  Super fun game for him [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=760.06s)]
*  And the celtics predictably put poor zingas on him to start the game and put tatum on towns [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=762.9399999999999s)]
*  Which is what they've done every nicks game, which is why this game felt in terms of experiencing it live watching it live [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=768.3s)]
*  One of the stranger games I can remember because at half time it felt like standard issue nick celtics [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=775.9s)]
*  Like i've seen this game a bunch of times the celtics are winning by a lot [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=781.26s)]
*  They're doing all the things that annoy the nicks and give them problems and he just were like I guess this is how the series is [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=784.78s)]
*  Going to go because like this is exactly what we expected and then it completely flips on its head [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=789.9s)]
*  Hart was active setting screens because he had their centers on him and I thought missoula [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=795.02s)]
*  Made a mistake late in the game and I put I have it in my notes [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=800.7s)]
*  I thought he sort of switched horford onto hart much sooner than he did instead of keeping him on cat and getting that brunson cat [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=803.98s)]
*  Pick and roll which they just switched and horford ends up on brunson. You could do that with hart if you want [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=810.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't think they would switch if they were on heart. So I thought he kept him [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=815.58s)]
*  Um on on catalogue too long by the way, josh hart footnote from detroit game six just footnote forgotten footnote [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=818.78s)]
*  second quarter of that game [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=825.74s)]
*  Nick's pistons are on a run [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=828.14s)]
*  Knicks are walking up the floor. They're clearly calling a timeout like josh hart has been instructed to call a timeout tibbs is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=830.62s)]
*  Complaining on the bench about whatever and josh hart sees everybody stop playing and just aborts the plan drives into traffic [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=837.26s)]
*  Draws a foul two free points. Yeah that did nicks would otherwise not have gotten in a game [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=845.1s)]
*  They won by a brunson shot at the end of the game. I texted josh hart after the game and I was like dude [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=850.0600000000001s)]
*  That was like did you do the fake timeout and steal two points in a game you guys won by three and he texted [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=856.3000000000001s)]
*  So I do back like yeah, lol. I was about to call timeout, but I saw nobody was playing [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=861.42s)]
*  So that's a josh hart play that's like a heady and it mattered. They won the game by three points [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=865.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if anyone even like took note of it during the game [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=869.9s)]
*  Yeah, this is the dream game for josh hart other than he was one for five from three because [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=872.86s)]
*  This is a kryptonite guy for the celtics for how they're composed [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=878.14s)]
*  This undersized dude that you kind of you have to just leave them open. But when you leave them open [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=882.5400000000001s)]
*  He's basically doing the drew holiday version of what drew holiday does multiplied by three and just he's around [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=888.5400000000001s)]
*  He's annoying the celtics are not a great rebounding team [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=894.7s)]
*  They're like a team rebounding team tatum is probably the best rebounder on the team [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=897.9s)]
*  And that's the kind of team hart they they don't have the the durin on the team, you know, they [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=901.74s)]
*  They uh, so he was I thought all over the place just being frisky and annoying and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=907.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean ananobis finished with 29 points and he was six for 11 from three. I'm not sure he could play better than that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=912.3000000000001s)]
*  But I thought what was notable [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=918.62s)]
*  Was he was carrying himself like he was as good as those guys [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=920.86s)]
*  So you so there there's a recipe in place because the other thing that's alarming [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=924.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean they played 51 for bridges 45 for heart 43 brunson 45 ananoby, which is just like this is just what this is [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=928.22s)]
*  at this point [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  But they seemed healthier and fresher than the celtics [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=936.86s)]
*  right [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=940.14s)]
*  Tatum tatum seemed fine drew was moving good white but for the most part [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=941.5s)]
*  You know, you got horford out there playing huge minutes because poor zingas can't play horford ends up at 34 [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=946.46s)]
*  um [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=952.22s)]
*  I thought because this [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=953.34s)]
*  This became your kind of game where it was like, all right the nicks want to get brunson on horford [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=955.5s)]
*  The celtics want to get tatum on towns and that's just what we're going to do for the last five minutes of the game [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=960.86s)]
*  We want this match [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=965.58s)]
*  You want this match? I was wondering [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  If mezula would go super small with tatum at the five and put pritchard out there instead of horford [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=970.3000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that was? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=976.22s)]
*  in play maybe [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=978.62s)]
*  Maybe because then now you're switching now, I guess you would hunt pritchard in that scenario with brunson [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=980.62s)]
*  And I think I like that matchup more for the celtics than horford [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=986.38s)]
*  uh [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=990.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I you know hauser's injury leaves you one perimeter guy short [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  So you're really stretching all the guys you have left to play that lineup [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=995.0999999999999s)]
*  But I don't think that's a bad I don't think that's a bad line up. By the way, you said tatum looked fine [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=998.2199999999999s)]
*  They did look fine seven of 23 [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1002.14s)]
*  Uh four fifteen from three it just has to make more bad more shots. Um [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1004.6999999999999s)]
*  He it was yeah, and it was a play with the food settle game and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1009.9s)]
*  Everyone who's watched the celtics team in the last couple years [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1013.66s)]
*  They've watched the team goes up between 17 and 25 in the third quarter [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1016.14s)]
*  And then for whatever reason it it just drops and they'd go too slow and we've seen it. We've seen it 50 times [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1020.14s)]
*  Yeah, uh [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1028.3799999999999s)]
*  Again, the only thing that was different [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1029.98s)]
*  About this nick celtics game for a half than the other four they've played [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1032.7s)]
*  Is that the nicks switched with towns so often and I get why they're trying to be the magic [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1036.8600000000001s)]
*  They're trying to do what the magic did to depress the celtics three point volume spoiler. They did not [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1041.98s)]
*  And the risk of it was made very clear right away is towns getting in foul trouble and he got in foul trouble into his credit [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1047.18s)]
*  He stayed out of trouble [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1053.02s)]
*  Yeah, in this every there's a lot of guys all night and in both games in foul trouble [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1054.8600000000001s)]
*  Um, and I I do wonder what level of switching we're going to see with towns [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1059.5s)]
*  In game two because it's an interesting risk reward that I don't really think paid off for the nicks [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1065.18s)]
*  Yeah, michael pina wrote about that for the ringer [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1070.38s)]
*  That they basically just emulated the orlando strategy and towns in particular there were there were plays where he just was kind of wandering around [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1073.66s)]
*  Like uh, like a drunk guy leaving the bar at two in the morning and the celtics were just trying to find him so they could [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1082.54s)]
*  torture him but [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1087.66s)]
*  Listen what orlando did? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1088.8600000000001s)]
*  That's basically you're forcing the celtics into the play with your food strategy. Um, i'm not super nervous yet. I I don't know why [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1091.26s)]
*  But I just feel like everything went right down the stretch for the nicks in that game and the celtics just it was a weird game [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1099.8999999999999s)]
*  The jalen brown thing makes me more nervous than the porzingis thing because I think they can win without porzingis this series [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1105.6599999999999s)]
*  Long term, I don't know if they can win four rounds. But if jalen's going to be [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1112.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, he was seven for 20. He was one for 10 from three [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1116.3s)]
*  um [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1120.22s)]
*  And I just don't think feel like athletically he looks like he did [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1121.4199999999998s)]
*  I think you're underselling the porzingis thing. They're just such [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1125.6599999999999s)]
*  A different team. I know but I wasn't counting on it. You know, you're counting. All right [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1129.58s)]
*  Life is much harder for towns. It was a bonus. Porzingis is in the game [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1133.26s)]
*  Oh, no question, but to me porzingis is a bonus [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1136.9399999999998s)]
*  You know when you miss half the season [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1140.54s)]
*  And you look like you did in the last in the last series like you know that [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1143.26s)]
*  Though where I was thinking about is can they get him right if they get through the nicks to this next round because [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1147.26s)]
*  You come off that nicks piston series and like all right, they barely beat [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1152.8600000000001s)]
*  You know a piston scene that doesn't have half as much talent as the celtics like come on [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1156.94s)]
*  um [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1162.54s)]
*  listen [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1163.5800000000002s)]
*  One of the great nicks wins [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1164.7s)]
*  in a while [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1166.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, I know a lot of nicks fans. I don't think they're high the hopes were super high [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1167.98s)]
*  But the brunson piece of it the fact that this guy can be this great at the end of games really [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1172.78s)]
*  You feel like you have a puncher's chance [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1177.9s)]
*  And this would be [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1180.46s)]
*  You know if they could somehow do this, this would be a phenomenal phenomenal upset [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1182.06s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I mean they would the celtics where I think [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1187.82s)]
*  They started out minus one thousand for the series. I think they ended up like minus 800 [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1190.46s)]
*  um [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1195.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think the general feeling was that the nicks were going to lose and tips was going to get fired [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1196.6200000000001s)]
*  So now [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1200.9399999999998s)]
*  Doors open who the hell knows I picked celtics in five [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1201.9799999999998s)]
*  I've actually been higher than consensus on the nicks this year. I mean I when the nicks were [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1205.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh in whatever against all the best teams in the nba. I was you know talking to people around league. I'm like [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1210.54s)]
*  I still kind of like this team [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1215.58s)]
*  Just raw talent wise. I think they're a more dangerous playoff team than their record [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1217.9799999999998s)]
*  But I just hated this matchup for them [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1222.6999999999998s)]
*  It was really just about the matchup and how badly it's gone [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1224.4599999999998s)]
*  And it's so fun because we get to live in this moment right now [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1227.4199999999998s)]
*  Where we're three games into the second round and for at least the next 36 hours [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1230.7s)]
*  Everything feels like it's been flipped on its head and everything's in play all the favorites are down [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1236.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh one like who knows we could get to 72 96 hours from now and have orders restored [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1241.26s)]
*  But right now this is like a fun a fun place to live [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1246.06s)]
*  Last thing i'll say and then we'll move on to the okc game [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1249.34s)]
*  Tatum who I think has been spectacular and has been playing the best he's ever played and I thought he was awesome in the [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  Orlando series and just in general as a two-way guy and as a dominant kind of bully force [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1258.38s)]
*  Really went to another level. I don't know if it was a full step up, but it was somewhere between 50 and 75 [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1264.5400000000002s)]
*  A step up and you could just watch it day in day out [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1271.1000000000001s)]
*  I thought yesterday was not a good game for him at all and i'm really interested to see how he responds because [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1274.7s)]
*  that was three years ago tatum watching him and [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1281.1000000000001s)]
*  They need him to be the best player in this series to win and maybe basketball [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1284.06s)]
*  I was thinking about this actually maybe we just overthink all of basketball [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1289.02s)]
*  Maybe it just comes down to who's who has the best player who's going to play the best in the series? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1293.26s)]
*  And that's just all we should look at maybe that's what the denver okc series is [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1297.1s)]
*  Maybe that's just going to come down to who's going to be better. You're good. You're sga and that's it [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1300.7s)]
*  Well, ironically to be the best guy ironically. This was the um [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1305.1s)]
*  It was not I was not skeptical about boston last year [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1310.14s)]
*  I picked him to win the championship [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1312.8600000000001s)]
*  But that was the source of whatever skepticism remained about boston was well, they're going to face philly and not have the best player [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1313.98s)]
*  They're going to face milwaukee and not have the best player [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1319.5s)]
*  They're going to face dallas in the finals or denver and the finals and not have the best player [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1321.42s)]
*  And it turned out they were just the best team and tatum [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1325.98s)]
*  Outplayed some of those guys when given the opportunity to do it or was that was at their level at least so it's it's funny to [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1329.5s)]
*  To bring that up now in conjunction with brunson and tatum brunson was great and nobby was great [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1335.74s)]
*  And this is going to be a fun series. Hopefully. Well, the other piece of this now is the nicks have three home games [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1340.94s)]
*  And if they take care of business in all three they advance the next round and everybody's going to talk about how incredible and amazing [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1346.7s)]
*  And awesome that crowd is going to be and it will be [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1352.46s)]
*  um [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1355.42s)]
*  But I also feel like this celtics team in some ways. I trust them more of the road [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1356.3799999999999s)]
*  Um, I don't know what happens to them at home, especially when they have these big leads and the energy just kind of dips [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1362.14s)]
*  But the game's going to be incredible the tickets. I think are going to be for this series probably the hardest nicks tickets since 1999 [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1367.98s)]
*  Right. Yeah, i've had i've had friends ask me [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1376.0600000000002s)]
*  About tickets and like people don't understand like I can't get you tickets [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1379.9s)]
*  I don't get tickets when I go to games I get press passes [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1383.42s)]
*  And i've had like I have a family friend who really wanted to go [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1386.46s)]
*  And i'm like you can go buy tickets. Good luck [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1389.74s)]
*  They're gonna i bet it's gonna be like a thousand dollars to get in the door like for upper upper deck seats [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1391.9s)]
*  Oh, it'll be I so what I was hearing from the celtics side was it was finals level to get in the door [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1396.8600000000001s)]
*  Just even wow game one like that's how hard it was nicks is even harder [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1401.74s)]
*  And then it has the added thing of the adam sober james dolan [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1406.06s)]
*  Whatever is happening there [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1411.18s)]
*  And you know, I think the nicks take as many tickets as as possible and [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1413.02s)]
*  Give them to whoever they want and just in general I think for the demand versus [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1418.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I can help you out. There's no I can help you out with these nicks camps anymore [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1422.22s)]
*  It all comes down to dolan because he controls everything and the dolan adam silver thing is just bizarre. This is the [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1426.46s)]
*  This is the feud [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1433.5s)]
*  That everybody in the league talks about but nobody actually talks about out loud, right? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1435.26s)]
*  We're doing it right now stories have been written about it [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1439.5s)]
*  No, but I mean like this is james dolan writes angry correspondents frequently [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1442.3799999999999s)]
*  I think it's way angrier and weirder like at this point. He's just the dissenting vote and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1447.02s)]
*  Basically any chance he can get he's going to do it and it's just gotten super weird [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1452.2199999999998s)]
*  so that's this other variable of this but [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1456.06s)]
*  boston new york amazing. All right. This episode is brought to you by degree original cool rush deodorant [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-PC2KHVuU&t=1459.1s)]
