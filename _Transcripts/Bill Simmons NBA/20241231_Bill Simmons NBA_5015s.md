# The All-Positive NBA Show With Kirk Goldsberry  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg)
*  Kurt, the NBA has taken a lot of hits, even on this podcast in a couple of ways, a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=0.0s)]
*  lot of complaining, a lot of nitpicking, a lot of people forgetting what the league [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4.32s)]
*  was like 10 years, 20 years, 30 years ago, and holding on to some ideal of something [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=9.84s)]
*  I'm not positive really existed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=15.36s)]
*  But what I want to do today is no negativity at all. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=17.36s)]
*  All the positive storylines, all the things I'm excited about. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  But before we get into it, do you think this is overboard with people [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=23.68s)]
*  complaining about the season this year? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=28.24s)]
*  Because I actually feel like we hit that point about two weeks ago. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=29.68s)]
*  Yeah, I got sick of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=34.16s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=35.28s)]
*  We're toughest, though. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=36.0s)]
*  Everybody's going through the holidays, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  We're toughest on the ones we love the most. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=38.56s)]
*  That's one of the things you learn. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=40.96s)]
*  Good way to think about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=43.44s)]
*  And we have high standards for the NBA, Bill, don't we? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=44.0s)]
*  It's a product that we cherish that's been with us for our whole lives. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=47.92s)]
*  So I think a lot of it comes from a good place, honestly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=52.16s)]
*  But there's been a lot of people just waiting. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=54.72s)]
*  I feel like the take shots at the NBA that have used this recent news cycle as a chance [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=57.28s)]
*  to just get their grievances out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  And frankly, it has gotten to be a little too much. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=67.6s)]
*  And this happens with anything. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=68.16s)]
*  This happens with bands. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=69.92s)]
*  It happens with actors. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=71.68s)]
*  It happens with writers where you just become convinced things were better five years ago, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=73.68s)]
*  10 years ago. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=78.16s)]
*  And that's just the way it is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=78.8s)]
*  The NBA is really good right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to go through a whole bunch of things. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=82.16s)]
*  But I just want to start here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=84.64s)]
*  And we're going to go, yeah, I asked you to come up with some things you want to hit as well. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=85.92s)]
*  I have a bunch of them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=90.56s)]
*  The number one thing I want to hit, though, is just basketball is better played now than it ever was. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=92.0s)]
*  And it's not close. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=97.76s)]
*  It's not an argument. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  The players are more skilled. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=100.8s)]
*  They shoot better. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=102.4s)]
*  The games are more high scoring. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=103.68s)]
*  The scoring is better in the games. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=105.76s)]
*  The defense is better. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=107.84s)]
*  The skill is better. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  I would urge people to really watch closely some of these games. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=111.28s)]
*  One of the things that's changed for me just from a skill level that I constantly marvel at, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=114.64s)]
*  especially I went to a Clippers Warriors game in person a couple of days ago, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=120.56s)]
*  the ability for people to just drive and then throw these one handed, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=125.04s)]
*  perfectly placed passes to guys in the corner. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=129.2s)]
*  Nobody was doing that 10 years ago. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=133.28s)]
*  And now you have 70. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=135.76s)]
*  Tyler Hero is basically Joe Burrow in those. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=137.28s)]
*  And you wouldn't think of him as a good passer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=140.56s)]
*  I'm just so impressed over and over again with how skilled these dudes are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  And I don't think people see it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=148.24s)]
*  Or the people that do see it maybe were not loud enough. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=150.24s)]
*  But am I crazy thinking these guys are just better than they used to be? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=153.04s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=157.68s)]
*  In fact, I feel like somebody told me, you know, small ball was about... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=158.4s)]
*  The 2010s were about small ball. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=161.76s)]
*  We're halfway through the 2020s here, Bill. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=163.2s)]
*  And we might call it skill ball, I think, because even the big dudes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=166.48s)]
*  like Jokic and Embiid and Wemby, name a center from 2004 or 1994. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=170.72s)]
*  Could they do anything that Jokic could do? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  Maybe Rashid Wallace. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=179.2s)]
*  There were some guys that were super skilled [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=180.64s)]
*  that could shoot the ball and pass and dribble. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=183.92s)]
*  Well, it's basically Rashid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=185.76s)]
*  Rashid was the guy everyone pointed to and said, oh my God, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  this guy, he can shoot from outside. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  He can post up and we held him up to this crazy level. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=192.16s)]
*  And he was like 16 points a game. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=198.64s)]
*  And I think LeBron helped change that too. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=199.28s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to be a five to a player to borrow the term from baseball. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=201.52s)]
*  And like this generation does everything. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=206.08s)]
*  Everybody does everything. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=209.52s)]
*  Dribble, pass and shoot. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=211.04s)]
*  And skill has never been this high. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=212.24s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons offenses are scoring so much. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=215.12s)]
*  It's not just the lack of defense. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=217.68s)]
*  These offensive skills have made the offensive end almost impossible to defend. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=219.76s)]
*  So I think it's fair to say that the talent pool, the NBA, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=224.56s)]
*  the 500 dudes in that league at any given time, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=228.16s)]
*  this is the best group of 500 basketball players we've ever had. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't even think it's close. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=234.0s)]
*  And I also think it's probably the best top 50 we've ever had by far. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=235.2s)]
*  Like I was looking at 2025 versus 2005. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=239.44s)]
*  So in 2025, we're averaging 113 points a game. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=244.32s)]
*  In 2005, we averaged 97.2, 16 points less. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=248.24s)]
*  We're shooting better now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=254.24s)]
*  We're 46.4% field goal. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=255.28s)]
*  We were 44.7 in 2005. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=257.44s)]
*  Three points shooting slightly better. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=260.4s)]
*  35.9, it was 35.6. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=261.92s)]
*  Assists were five higher a game. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=264.08s)]
*  They're shooting 21 and a half more threes a game. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=267.12s)]
*  But everyone points to that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=270.96s)]
*  And really we changed long twos and bad post-ups for threes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=273.52s)]
*  And I'm fine with the trade. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=278.08s)]
*  I would rather watch somebody shoot a three. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=279.6s)]
*  I think when people, and including me, have complained about the NBA, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=281.68s)]
*  and again, we're trying to go all positive, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=285.04s)]
*  there's a sameness to what they're watching. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=287.52s)]
*  And what it really is, it's not the threes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=289.44s)]
*  To me, it's the pick for the guy 30 feet from the basket at the top. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=292.16s)]
*  It's the over and over again of two guys in the corner [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=296.8s)]
*  and one or two picks coming up for somebody like Tatum, whoever it is. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=299.84s)]
*  Jaylen Bartlett, it could be anybody. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=303.68s)]
*  And just seeing that over and over again, the sameness of it, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=305.68s)]
*  I think that's what people are thinking of. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=308.96s)]
*  It's not the fact that we're shooting more threes [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=310.64s)]
*  because they're making more threes and we have more skilled players. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=312.4s)]
*  I don't know how you fix the sameness, and I'm not sure I care. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Where do you stand on that? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=319.44s)]
*  I think they've got to move the line. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=321.84s)]
*  And again, I'm staying positive here, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=323.11999999999995s)]
*  but you started with the guys throwing to the corner. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, one of the reasons those guys are so good at throwing to the corner [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=327.52s)]
*  every trip down that there's two guys in the corners the whole time, every time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=330.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=333.28s)]
*  I know that wasn't true. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=333.44s)]
*  There's just guys there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't think, and we're probably going to talk about Jokic and Wembe and Shea. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  If you're really watching the game, there's not that much sameness. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=342.72s)]
*  And again, and you started the podcast by talking about people forgot what we were [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=346.56s)]
*  watching, like Dump It Down and Mikhail or Parrish or Mike Juminski. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=350.48s)]
*  You have to remember this wasn't Jordan and Bird every night. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Sometimes it was the Mavericks and Bullets. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=358.48s)]
*  And there used to be some pretty repetitive actions in the post-up era of the NBA that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=361.36s)]
*  weren't fantastic, so to speak. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=365.36s)]
*  So I think it is relatively fair, but it's not new to say that the NBA is kind of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=367.36s)]
*  homogenous at times. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=372.24s)]
*  Well, and the other thing, and one of the things that I think has been so great [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=373.68s)]
*  about this season, we have so many good guards. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=376.8s)]
*  And I look back to that first half of the 2000s when everyone was complaining and I [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=380.8s)]
*  was doing my bit about how I was one of the last 20 NBA fans. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=385.68s)]
*  Even the guys that were the best guys, they were all doing Jordan imitations to some [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=389.04s)]
*  degree. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=395.04s)]
*  There were these guards that had the ball for a shitload. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=395.36s)]
*  And even you look at the all-NBA and the all-stars from that, it was like that was [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=398.72s)]
*  the Gilbert Arena, Sarah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  That was TMAC with the ball at the time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=406.0s)]
*  That was Kobe with the ball at the time. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=407.92s)]
*  That was why we latched on to Steve Nash and the Sun so much because the style they [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=411.68s)]
*  were playing was different. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=415.68s)]
*  Wade had the ball at the time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=416.48s)]
*  LeBron had the ball at the time. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=417.76000000000005s)]
*  But it wasn't the same kind of smart offense we have now because the spacing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=419.6s)]
*  wasn't the same. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=423.36s)]
*  You had these guys that had the ball at the time, but they're also playing with [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=424.56s)]
*  centers clogging the lane. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  We had power forwards back then. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=429.84s)]
*  They kind of didn't know where to put them because they couldn't space. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=431.28s)]
*  You had like the Vin Baker, Antoine Walker, these guys that were just, I guess Antoine [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  could shoot some throughs. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  So Maurice Stoudemeier, people trying to figure out how to use these big guys. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=439.2s)]
*  And now those big guys can pop out and they can do pop and picks. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=445.28s)]
*  I just think the product's better. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=449.44s)]
*  I don't think there's, go back and watch. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  Go on YouTube and watch just a random 2005 regular season game. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=453.52s)]
*  We were all like, what are we going to do about this league? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=458.08s)]
*  This is bad. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  How do we fix this? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think they fixed a lot of it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=462.96s)]
*  And to me, it's a positive, not a negative. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=464.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  The three point line has made basketball a lot better. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=468.4s)]
*  The 2010s brought us pace and space. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=470.96s)]
*  D'Antoni had the controls for those Sun's teams, but also that sort of heliocentric [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=473.12s)]
*  offense in Houston that really figured out how to sort of spam a superstar over and over [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=479.04s)]
*  and over again, but to great effect to make their offense some of the best in the NBA. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=484.48s)]
*  I don't always love hard and I know we're still low and I vibe on that point, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=489.44s)]
*  but aligning that hyper usage superstar, that guard, that skill with spacing and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=494.16s)]
*  smarter plays and high screen rolls has been effective and made possessions more successful [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=499.6s)]
*  in general. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=505.44s)]
*  But I think the game is more open and if you like scoring, it's definitely more fun to watch now [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=506.48s)]
*  than an average NBA game. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=511.36s)]
*  And this is again, it's something I've been noticing like Jordan, this Jordan, that Jordan [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  was only one of, you know, one of the 30 teams, right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=516.24s)]
*  So an average NBA game in the nineties was not Jordan. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  And I forget that bill. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=523.36s)]
*  It's like the replacement level game from the nineties was not a great product. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=524.96s)]
*  Well, I have, this is another thing I have, which ties into this. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=530.24s)]
*  The watchable basketball across the board. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=534.16s)]
*  I think people really take for granted now, and I would urge people to go back and look at [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  the bottom like rung of teams in 2015. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=542.24s)]
*  Like that was when we had Philly in the process or in 2005, you just had these broken teams [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  that were stuck with these terrible salary cap roster decisions, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=551.68s)]
*  You had like the Marbury Knicks, you had the Celtics stuck with Paul Pierce and Ricky Davis [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=556.0s)]
*  and Vin Baker's terrible contract, which turned into Rafe LaFrance's terrible contract. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=562.0s)]
*  You go around the league, even like LeBron was stuck on a terrible Cavs team for, you [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=566.72s)]
*  know, three years. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=571.92s)]
*  You go around the league, there was 10 to 15 unwatchable teams. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=572.8s)]
*  I look at the bad teams now and the bad teams, Portland, Charlotte, Washington, New Orleans, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=576.64s)]
*  Toronto, Utah. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=583.28s)]
*  I can watch all of those teams. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=585.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=586.96s)]
*  I like watching Utah. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=587.44s)]
*  New Orleans is the most fascinating five and 28 team I think we've ever had in the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=588.96s)]
*  history of the league. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=592.88s)]
*  Like I watched them last night play right down to the wire against the Clippers. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=593.6s)]
*  Charlotte's got LaMelo and Brandon Miller. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=597.6s)]
*  Portland, where our just a barrier is located now, like Portland's fun to watch. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=599.84s)]
*  They've got a lot of weird pieces. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=606.0s)]
*  They have guys who can spring for 35 at any night compared to where we were 10 years ago. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=607.52s)]
*  It's no contest. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=613.0400000000001s)]
*  The league is so much deeper and more entertaining. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=614.4000000000001s)]
*  Do you see that too? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=616.64s)]
*  Is there anybody I'm missing? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=617.52s)]
*  No, I just say the average league pass game right now is way better than it's ever been. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=619.44s)]
*  Tonight's game, we have Clippers Spurs. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=625.12s)]
*  That's not a bad game. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=626.72s)]
*  Wemby, we have Timberwolves and OKC. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=627.52s)]
*  That's a great game. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=629.84s)]
*  Grizzlies at Suns. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=630.96s)]
*  That's a great game. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=632.32s)]
*  Cavs at Lakers. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=633.76s)]
*  That's a great game. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=635.52s)]
*  That's just tonight. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=637.44s)]
*  Those are your options on New Year's Eve if you're going to watch a game before you go [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=638.48s)]
*  out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=642.32s)]
*  That's a great set of games. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=642.48s)]
*  And again, we can't just judge everything by, oh, Jordan versus the Knicks was incredible. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  The 90s, well, the Mavs versus the Bullets was not. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=648.56s)]
*  And I think the average NBA game in 2024 as we hit 2025 is a very good product relative [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=652.16s)]
*  to where we came from. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  I remember the first year I did countdown. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=660.88s)]
*  There weren't five playoff teams you wanted to see. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=664.16s)]
*  I remember it was either 2013 or 14. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  There was just some Bulls net series that felt like it was going on for five weeks. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=669.68s)]
*  You know, that was in 2013. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  We had Memphis make the conference finals with that like Zibo Gasol. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=676.72s)]
*  Nobody could make a three. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=681.5200000000001s)]
*  They had no spacing at all. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=682.96s)]
*  There was some good stuff, too, like the 2014 Spurs were just a revelation and really great. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=685.84s)]
*  And I think when people think about basketball before we moved into this three crazy era, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=692.32s)]
*  the 2014 Spurs and especially what they did in Miami, that's kind of the ideal for the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=699.2800000000001s)]
*  old way of basketball that tied to the 1970 Knicks and the 74 Celtics and the Russell [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=703.68s)]
*  Celtics, the ball movement, everything built around a big guy, guards who could attack. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=710.4799999999999s)]
*  Those days are over because everybody can shoot threes down. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  We're just not going to have a team like the 2014 Spurs again. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=718.56s)]
*  But I would urge people to go back. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=721.52s)]
*  Even Miami, who had LeBron during this incredible MVP heat check run and Wade and Bosch, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  they're pretty tough to watch in 2014. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=732.56s)]
*  They could barely put together seven guys. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=733.2s)]
*  Now all the best teams have seven or 11 guys. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=735.36s)]
*  You know, Pritchard's the seventh guy in the Celtics and can score 25 in a night. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  So I just think it's no contest right now. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=743.2s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=746.48s)]
*  I think the 2014 Spurs probably my favorite basketball team in my life. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  That's a special team for me. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  A beautiful game. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=753.2s)]
*  Good to great Manu, Tim, Kawhi, all firing on all cylinders. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=754.4000000000001s)]
*  It was great chemistry. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=758.64s)]
*  Yeah, not ancient history, but sort of becoming old school. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think that team was as deep as it gets to remember their bench. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  The foreign legion had a bunch of international players. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=766.56s)]
*  They were ahead of their time with ball movement, player movement, and this international stuff. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=769.04s)]
*  But spectacular aesthetics on the court. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=773.52s)]
*  It's probably an unfair standard for an average NBA team. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  Again, an average game. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=779.28s)]
*  But yeah, like the games that I mentioned tonight, those are great. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=780.8s)]
*  The Cavs don't just stay there. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  They're playing with a lot of movement. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=786.4s)]
*  They're great on both ends of the floor. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=787.76s)]
*  And then you get to watch the Lakers. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  So LeBron playing Cleveland. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=791.36s)]
*  They're just great games, great players, almost every game tonight, for instance. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=792.64s)]
*  I think the league's in a good place. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=797.76s)]
*  Did you have the Cavs on your list? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  I didn't, but I have a related one. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=804.4799999999999s)]
*  What do you got on the Cavs, Bill? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=806.16s)]
*  They killed Golden State last night. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=808.64s)]
*  The Cavs are 27 and 4. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=810.64s)]
*  When we're talking about in the All Positive NBA podcast, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  um, the Cavs are just great to watch. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=817.6s)]
*  In a lot of ways they've, they inverted what the Celtics did last year, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=822.64s)]
*  where instead of being built around these two great wings, like the Celtics were with [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=826.88s)]
*  three point shooting and defense, they inverted it where they're built around these two great [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  guards with three point shooting and with defense. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=835.44s)]
*  And if you, if you're not ready for them on the wrong night, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=839.12s)]
*  or you think you're ready for them, but you're not, or they're hitting shots, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  they're basically unbeatable. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=846.48s)]
*  I don't know how this is going to translate to the playoffs yet, but, um, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=847.84s)]
*  but the fact that we have them and OKC, who is on a winning streak right now, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=851.6s)]
*  who's going to win 60 plus games, who's just a regular season monster. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=856.4s)]
*  And then the sleeping giant Celtics team who just clearly is on cruise control now until March, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  April, but then some of the other teams we have, like just the depth of contenders at the top [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=865.12s)]
*  and the unpredictability of figuring out, even though I'm in the, oh, it's going to be OKC [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=870.16s)]
*  Boston camp. But like I watched Cleveland last night. I'm like that Cleveland's going to be [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=874.4s)]
*  tough. Like Boston's got to get their shit together. Cleveland's probably getting the one seed. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=878.72s)]
*  Boston's going to have to win a playoff game in a series in Cleveland. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  And that team is about as confident as it gets right now. So I would throw them into [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=886.56s)]
*  in the all positive pod. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=890.24s)]
*  Yeah. And I would say, you know, we got on here before the season. I said, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=892.24s)]
*  Hey, look out for Cleveland. I think they can get the two seed. And right now, like obviously [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=895.76s)]
*  at the season end of the day, they're the one seed. And then the other team I'd put in there. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=899.76s)]
*  And one of the general themes of the first part of this, the East isn't as bad as we thought it [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=903.52s)]
*  was in the first few weeks. And the other team I got to put in there is New York Knicks. And [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=907.52s)]
*  that's our sort of a related one here, Bill. Let's go. The NBA is so much better when the New York [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=912.24s)]
*  Knickerbockers are good. And MSG is hosting games in April and May. Bing bong. They've won nine of [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=917.28s)]
*  their last 10. Their defense has come around. Their starting five slash closing five is legit. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=924.24s)]
*  They could pass the Celtics depending on how your team does on this road trip in early 2025. They [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=930.56s)]
*  could be the two seed here in a few days. But I think the East has three very good teams. I'm with [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=935.76s)]
*  you. I'm still taking Boston. I think they're tired from the Olympics and the playoff run last [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=942.9599999999999s)]
*  year. But I think the Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Knicks, we could sort of pair these and [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  be like, look, East Coast basketball is good. And if Philly has a pulse now and can come around, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  Milwaukee's good. Look, the East has as many good teams as the West right now. Period. And I wasn't [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=957.68s)]
*  saying that at the beginning of the year. And I think it's good for the league and its ratings [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=964.0799999999999s)]
*  when the Eastern time zone has some good basketball. So I think if we loop all this together, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=967.04s)]
*  I think it's a really good storyline for the league in 2025 that the East is pretty good. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=972.4s)]
*  Well, don't count out the zombie magic. Of course. They're just kind of wandering around in a dark [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=976.88s)]
*  empty building with like, it's Tristan De Silva. He's like, where'd this guy come from? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=982.24s)]
*  The Knicks, they're a half game behind the Celtics. All the Celtic fans I know, including myself, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=990.4s)]
*  are very focused on it. They have two players playing just out of control. Fantastic. And I [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=995.6s)]
*  want to talk about them in a little bit. The big thing for them is they got bridges going. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1001.36s)]
*  And I remember saying at the start of the year, I don't know, three weeks in, I was like, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1006.32s)]
*  what was the point of this bridges trade if they're just going to make him this accessory [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1011.04s)]
*  that stands in the corner? Like this is a really good offensive player who's we've watched him [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1014.7199999999999s)]
*  carry a net team a couple of years ago and they would actually run crunch time stuff. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1019.92s)]
*  Why are they just kind of sticking them over there? You look at his November stats. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1023.68s)]
*  He was, you know, 14.7 points a game, 29% from three. He took in November 15 games. How many [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  free throws do you think he took? He should average two games. I'd say 30. Yeah, he took six. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1038.88s)]
*  So I look at that and I'm just like, you're just playing in this guy in the corner. And that was [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  what the eye test was backing them up. But in December, it really seems like they tried to get [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1051.44s)]
*  him involved. He had that big day last week, but he's at 21 and a half a game now. And it's, he's [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  kind of moved into that him and Ananobe kind of sharing that number three score thing. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1062.4s)]
*  Some of that's predictable, but some of it, you know, it seemed pretty bleak for him in November. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1066.88s)]
*  It's like, what are we doing with this guy? Especially with everything you gave up now, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1071.0400000000002s)]
*  I think they've figured out at least the four there. There are the thing that worries me about [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1076.16s)]
*  them is there's going to be a couple of buyout guys in February. And that's a number one buyout [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1081.2s)]
*  candidate team because you're going to a team that has a chance to make the finals. You're going to [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1087.1200000000001s)]
*  play. You get to be in New York city, you know, that if I'm making like buyout destination, if [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1092.08s)]
*  I'm whoever I'm looking at them. It's too bad. There's not a Villanova center that they could [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  put next to town. So I don't think they have, but that's exactly right. But that's it. In all [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1104.7199999999998s)]
*  seriousness, if like, I love OKC cause they have two different front court looks when Chet's right [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1113.4399999999998s)]
*  and Hartenstein's right. I feel like that's the weakness right now, especially against Porzingis [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1118.48s)]
*  or Giannis they need. And I'm not sure what Mitchell Robinson is going to bring come playoff [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  time, but if they can get a real sturdy five, they're not going to get a go bear, but just a [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1128.96s)]
*  traditional five that could let them go big, play big against some of these rim pressuring teams, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1133.8400000000001s)]
*  especially in Milwaukee or Philadelphia. I think they're in great shape. Now their defense is [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1140.0s)]
*  already, I think it's number two in the last 10 games. They've won nine of those 10 games. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1145.36s)]
*  Their defense is good. I just, if they really want to get over the hump bill, I think they need to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1150.56s)]
*  have a couple of different looks in that front court. And right now that's sort of the weakness [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  with towns only maybe a little Mitch Robinson in there. I think they need, they have Ms. Hartenstein [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1158.32s)]
*  somebody like that. If they could get on the biomarker or even in trademark, somebody could come [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1163.36s)]
*  in and give them a traditional five up front. All right. Two more things on the next that tie [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  into what you said about why this has been a good season in the all positive NBA podcast. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1174.16s)]
*  We have to keep going on this one towns last two years, 21, eight rebounds, this 50, 40 guy. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  I kind of felt like he had maxed out from a potential standpoint, but it was hard to tell [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  how much had to do with go bear being on the court with him. He was always 25 feet from the basket [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1193.0400000000002s)]
*  on offense. Ant was starting to have the ball a lot. And it was like, well, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1198.88s)]
*  maybe on this next team, there's a case if you're playing them as like the stretch five, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1204.5600000000002s)]
*  but he also has this rebounding block shop burden. Maybe, maybe there's something else here. Well, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1209.1200000000001s)]
*  there's something else here. He's 24 and a half points, 13.5 rebounds, 55% field goal, 45% from [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1215.68s)]
*  three. I test wise the most fun I've had watching him and the concerns we had in the summer about [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1224.24s)]
*  this guy in New York. I don't know, man. He's a little weird. I don't this kid. There's a version [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1232.48s)]
*  of this where this goes bad. It's been the opposite. I think this is actually, they brought out the [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1238.08s)]
*  best in him. And I think they've really responded to him. And I think they have a great fan base. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1243.04s)]
*  I think they understand like, let's constantly get this guy going. Let's really be super duper, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1247.1200000000001s)]
*  super duper supportive of him. And it's working. And this is the most fun I've had watching him [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1252.72s)]
*  play basketball on top of the Brunson piece and how good those guys are playing off each other [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1258.32s)]
*  already, you know, and that's only going to get better as the season goes. So gigantic wind. Did [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1264.32s)]
*  you see this from towns? Had you given up? No, this team, this front office has made me feel dumb [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1269.68s)]
*  over and over again. I didn't, I didn't love the Brunson deal. I didn't hate it by any means, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1275.28s)]
*  but I certainly didn't see that coming. And then the trade, I thought I'd like to trade better for [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1279.12s)]
*  Minnesota. Yeah. Hand up. And credit to towns, credit to Leon Rose, credit to Tom Thibodeau. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1285.84s)]
*  They've won that trade, I think hands down. The Bridges trade again, looked like a disaster there [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1293.1999999999998s)]
*  for a few weeks. I'm not sure I love it to this point, given how much they gave up. But this team [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1299.52s)]
*  now looks very good in all of those, all those transactions look great. The bridge is one I'll [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1306.08s)]
*  reserve some judgment for until we, until we fully see it. But towns, I didn't see this. I was worried [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1312.24s)]
*  about him in the New York media as well. I'm still worried about him as the primary interior defender [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1318.24s)]
*  in the playoffs. Like I said, I think that's a fair point to sort of hold back. But towns and company [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1323.4399999999998s)]
*  have proved me wrong. They built this team in an era where trades and free agents, you're sort of [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1330.08s)]
*  less powerful than ever. And the best teams tend to be building with the draft more. Then you know, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1334.24s)]
*  Dick sort of built this team from other teams' players and it's very good. And I think they deserve [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1338.96s)]
*  credit for it. But it's working very well, Bill. They took a real gamble with how expensive that [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1343.84s)]
*  deal was. And you're like, and we talked about it last summer. I didn't love the deal for either team. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1350.32s)]
*  It made more sense from a talent standpoint for the Knicks, but the money was so disarming. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1356.8s)]
*  You just look at it and you're like, man, if we miss on this, there's no move, man. We are, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1361.76s)]
*  we are now pushing all the chips in, but it worked out and it's been great. And I really like towns, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1366.8s)]
*  even though he's such a dumbass sometimes on the court. And we would always, Russell and I would [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  always make fun of him during the playoffs because he would just, you know, get the fifth foul in the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1378.56s)]
*  third quarter and the worst, but 40 feet from the basket, just bumping over somebody on a pick. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1382.96s)]
*  But he seems like a good guy and by all accounts he is. And you could see when he came back to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1388.4s)]
*  Minnesota, you know, what he meant to the franchise, but just how his Knicks teammates reacted to him [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1393.28s)]
*  in Minnesota when they showed the video, it's just like clearly really liked. And I'm just glad it [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1399.3600000000001s)]
*  worked out because we've seen this league, a lot of these guys, sometimes when it feels like they [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1405.2s)]
*  can go either way from a talent standpoint, sometimes it goes the wrong way. Like you look [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1410.16s)]
*  at Zion right now, um, leading to the second thing. This, this I also love about the league [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1414.24s)]
*  and the all positive NBA podcast. Dallas not looking, locking up Jalen Brunson leads to this [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1420.32s)]
*  amazing kind of sliding doors, dominoes situation. It leads to Brunson and New York [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1429.76s)]
*  and all of these other things that happen with them where they become a really fun, legitimate [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1437.36s)]
*  contender for a fan base that's needed for 20 years. It eventually leads to Kyrie and Dallas [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1442.32s)]
*  and him rejuvenating his career. And I, you know, being one of the 15 to 20 most fun guys to watch [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1448.8799999999999s)]
*  in the league again, I'd given up on that. It happened. It caused a Brooklyn rebuild, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1455.04s)]
*  because Kyrie had a chance to go to Dallas, right? So that leads to whatever and, and, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  and them trading Kyrie and Katie. So why is the Brooklyn rebuild important? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1468.64s)]
*  Because Donovan Mitchell, who wanted to go to New York city and I will die on that Hill [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1472.96s)]
*  had nowhere to go. Brunson goes to the next becomes the guy. Well, he can't go there. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1477.76s)]
*  Brooklyn sucks. Well, what, what am I going to go there for? And you kind of, it's like, you know [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1484.16s)]
*  what you got, you don't know what you don't have. And he's looking around this Cleveland team and [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1490.24s)]
*  it's like, man, this team's really good. Maybe I should, maybe I should stop thinking about [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1494.24s)]
*  what's next and just kind of lock it down here. Signs the extension. Now they become a legitimate [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1498.64s)]
*  contender. That team falls into place. That team's super selfless. And I honestly, as weird as it [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1504.24s)]
*  sounds, I think it starts with the Brunson thing. And now we have a next legitimate contender. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1509.2s)]
*  We have Kyrie as a piece of a finals team last year. We have the calves as a legitimate contender [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1514.08s)]
*  and Brooklyn has the most fun summer team next summer. Yeah, that's a great take. I love that. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1520.16s)]
*  And I think like the Western conference talent, like Brunson, Donovan Mitchell and towns going [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1525.68s)]
*  from West to East, we talked about how the Celtics are the favorites, but the Eastern conference [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  needed, needed a talent infusion. And I think these transactions sort of bolstered again, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1537.0400000000002s)]
*  the Cavaliers are a story of Donovan Mitchell going to Cleveland. And then this next team has [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1542.8000000000002s)]
*  two really big Western conference imports at the top of the box score every night. So I think [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1548.32s)]
*  that those transactions, that's a great point. So now who can we get from the Western conference [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1553.84s)]
*  to move easy snacks bill? I mean, it's like Zion, Zion's next. You can save Zion. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1557.52s)]
*  One other thing with Brunson and then you're up next with positive. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1564.0s)]
*  I'm just in disbelief how good Brunson is. And I think we'd take it for granted now in a way, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1569.2s)]
*  because he's just does it night after night with this herky jerky, these different spots of the [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1575.12s)]
*  court, his ability, even at the end of games to always get the shot he wants. The crunch time [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1579.6799999999998s)]
*  stats with him are out of control. Like John Schumann had in his power rankings thing yesterday, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1585.1999999999998s)]
*  that Brunson, he was on a crunch time streak where his usage rate was like 46%, which is like, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1590.2399999999998s)]
*  you know, 98 finals, Jordan, that not as high as, as that. And over and over again, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1597.28s)]
*  teams know what they're going to do and he gets the shot he wants. I actually liked the signing for [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1602.64s)]
*  them when they, when they got him. Cause I really liked Brunson. I also never in a million years [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1609.44s)]
*  thought he was going to be this good. I thought he could be the piece of a really good team. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1615.0400000000002s)]
*  Maybe the, maybe the best guard on a contender, not this. And you watch him night to night and [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1619.2s)]
*  all the other guys kind of make sense as awesome crunch time guys, even somebody like Shea, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1627.68s)]
*  it's very old school. He's just going to get, he's either going to get to the rim or he's going to [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1632.08s)]
*  get like his little 12 to 15 spot. I've seen that I've seen there are guys in the seventies that did [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1636.24s)]
*  that. The Brunson thing. I don't know if I've seen before that like his arsenal of weird shots and, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1640.96s)]
*  and herky jerky, he'd be a nightmare to defend. Anyway, I wanted to mention that. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1647.12s)]
*  Yeah. He's also a great, you know, uh, sort of rebuke of the idea that everybody plays the same. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1651.1999999999998s)]
*  Here's this undersized guard going and playing two feet in the paint. Like John Wooden is his coach. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1656.8s)]
*  All these pivots and drop steps and floaters and pull ups. And he's just so talented and so smart [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1662.4s)]
*  with, he didn't get the Kevin McHale footwork as a guard in the paint. And it's, it's brilliant to [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1669.52s)]
*  watch. But dude, if the, if the Mavs knew that this guy was going to be putting up 50 in playoff [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1674.96s)]
*  games, I think they would have had a different whiteboard strategy before they let him go. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1679.8400000000001s)]
*  I think he would still be in Dallas. Nobody saw this coming. I don't think the Knicks [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1684.5600000000002s)]
*  knew he could do this. And of course they should say he did. Right. Man, he's been a revelation. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  And the other thing I'd say just on the Knicks is it's not only they're good. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1694.48s)]
*  You mentioned this earlier, the vibes are immaculate and they're fun. They're fun group of [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1698.08s)]
*  guys. It's a fun team to watch. Might be hard for a Celtics fan to admit, but it's sort of a neutral. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1702.24s)]
*  I like the Knicks because they're fans. They have great fans and they have a great building [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1708.48s)]
*  and the league's better when the Knicks are involved. And I hope we see Jaylen Brunston [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1712.8s)]
*  playing your team and the conference semis between Boston and New York. That would be [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1717.6s)]
*  absolutely dream come true for the Eastern conference playoffs this year. It's an awesome, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1722.32s)]
*  awesome, awesome matchup. And I, the, the fear for me is just the miles they've had to put on Al [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1727.1999999999998s)]
*  Horford already combined with poor Zingas who just can't seem to play two games in a row. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1734.32s)]
*  You know, I think the Celts matchup great with them. And in a way that's probably the team, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  the Knicks wouldn't, I would think definitely the team the Knicks wouldn't want to face because [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1745.76s)]
*  they just have these guards that they can throw a Brunson. They can counter towns with their own [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1749.6s)]
*  stretch fives. And then they have these wings that are better than the Knicks wings, but we might not [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1754.8s)]
*  ever see that Celtics team this year. I mean, I, I, again, this is the all positive NBA pod, but you [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1759.92s)]
*  really need luck with health and they had luck with Jaylen and Tatum all decade. You know, they [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1766.0s)]
*  got luck with poor Zingas for the most part. They were able to get to the playoffs and get just [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1773.2s)]
*  enough out of them to make it. They got luck with white and Horford. And we know with the NBA, like [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1778.32s)]
*  you can't count on that year to year. So give me another one. Give me an all positive. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1783.52s)]
*  The future is French, Bill Simmons. The future is French and it's, it's temporarily stationed in [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1788.64s)]
*  San Antonio, Texas. Victor Wimbenyama. We have LeBron James at age 40. We have Nikola Jokic turning [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1794.72s)]
*  30 in a few days or a month, I think. And Wemby's 20 and Wemby is giving us a very clear next up. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1802.24s)]
*  It doesn't mean he'll be the only one, but this dude is special. There's no, there's no other way [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1812.24s)]
*  to look at it. Everything is clicking. You know, he was very hyped like LeBron coming in. But I [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1818.56s)]
*  think Victor Wimbenyama is poised to be the next greatest player in the NBA at some point in the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1824.8s)]
*  next five years. I couldn't agree more. The gold medal game was a great sign by him. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1830.0s)]
*  The Christmas day Knicks game was a great sign by him. I had him down as well for, for the draft. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1836.72s)]
*  I wrote down Wemby's slow burn into a potential monster crunch time guy. Wemby to me has turned [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1844.32s)]
*  into when I'm home watching NBA, if he's in the fourth quarter and it's close, he's on a TV now. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1851.2s)]
*  And that wasn't the case last year. Last year it was more of like that team's a mess. It really [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1858.48s)]
*  makes me mad that I don't have a point guard. If he does something cool, I'll see it on social media. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1862.64s)]
*  This year, it's kind of like now that Chris Paul, which, you know, go figure they needed a point [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1868.08s)]
*  guard and he's, he's almost my age, but still knows what to do, how to get him the ball in the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1874.48s)]
*  right spots. But his last 18 is 29 and 10. Good sign. 50, 40, 87, 4.1 blocks a game. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1879.92s)]
*  And the nitpick is 4.6 free throws a game versus 11 threes a game. And that's going to be the tilt [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1893.04s)]
*  that I'm watching for at the end of these games, because what's so much fun to watch in these [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1899.92s)]
*  crunch times is where they get him the ball and then what he does. And he still has that like, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1905.28s)]
*  sometimes he plays lower than a size, you know, he'll do like these turnarounds where his, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1910.0s)]
*  he's like falling down or he's, you know, I think once he eventually realizes just, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1914.96s)]
*  I'm going to get eight feet from the basket, get me the ball. I'm taller than everyone. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1920.48s)]
*  I'm just going to get a good shot, but it's really fun watching him figure it out. No, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1924.0800000000002s)]
*  the last time I'm going back 40 years, but Samson, the first couple of years on the Rockets [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1928.3200000000002s)]
*  and Wemba Nyama pretty similar offensively, except for the three point shooting, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1934.08s)]
*  but Samson had the same stuff. Like he was just figuring out what his body was. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1940.64s)]
*  He had some really good stuff. He was always around the rim and big, in big moments. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1945.2s)]
*  And he was kind of nice around the foul line. And then he got hurt. We kind of never saw where it [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1950.24s)]
*  was going to go with Wemby. The thing, the thing that I'm watching for is the season keeps going. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1955.04s)]
*  They're a 500 team. We had them, I think under 35 for the season. They're clearly going to be in [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1960.16s)]
*  the playoff mix because he's just too good. They asked them some trades to make potentially. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1965.6000000000001s)]
*  But what I want to watch from him is the last five, six, seven minutes of the game, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1970.4s)]
*  where your shots coming from, are you just going to settle for threes? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1976.16s)]
*  Are you going to start figuring out, I need to be six, seven feet from the basket and around the [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1979.8400000000001s)]
*  rim on rebounds and stuff like that. What have you been watching from him with the evolution of [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1984.48s)]
*  that over the last year? He is so much more comfortable on the basketball court, specifically [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1989.68s)]
*  on the offensive end. I still think the biggest growth there is in the two point area as well. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=1995.6000000000001s)]
*  I think he needs to have a couple of just signature moves, like not a Sambor shuffle, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2000.48s)]
*  not necessarily a Euro step, but he should be able to develop some footwork. And we talked about [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2006.3200000000002s)]
*  Brunson just, if he had a little bit more footwork and some go-to moves, like we can all picture [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2011.2s)]
*  Michael or Kobe go into one of their go-to shots, like what's that going to be for him? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2016.24s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but once he gets it, look out. So I'm watching that he turns 21 [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2021.68s)]
*  this week. Nobody in league history has ever average three made threes. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2028.0s)]
*  How is he not 21 yet? Him and my daughter's boyfriend turning 21 in the same week. That's [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2031.6s)]
*  just nuts to me. Yeah. So nobody's ever made three threes in average three blocks of game. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2037.36s)]
*  He's at four blocks and easily three threes. So that's his signature thing. He's going to be [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2043.2s)]
*  a three point shooter. But what can he do inside of the arc? I think is where his big growth area [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2047.76s)]
*  is. I think he'll also, and you sort of alluded to this, a new rivalry in FIBA. I know it's a [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2054.56s)]
*  little early, but like 2027 World Cup, 2028 Olympics, you know, France is going to be loaded [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2062.08s)]
*  and they're going to be younger and he's going to be great. I think there's going to be a new [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2070.32s)]
*  France USA rivalry in these big competitions. I love True Patriot, True Patriot, Kurt Goldsberry [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2073.36s)]
*  is one of my favorite Kurt Goldsberry. Oh, it's keeping an eye on the gold medal in FIBA. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2079.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, I, you know, I work for team USA. I love international basketball. Like, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2084.48s)]
*  you know, FIBA is a great product. I think we all enjoyed the Olympics. I remember talking to R.C. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  Buford after the Olympics and I say, R.C. what was that like? He was like the perfect outcome. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2094.6400000000003s)]
*  Wemby almost won. So he's coming back angry. And my country won. So a lot of Spurs people [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2099.44s)]
*  love that he almost won, but not quite. And I think he has a chance when he's what? 23, 24 [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2105.68s)]
*  to do what Manu did, which is upset Goliath on the international stage and really become a special [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2112.08s)]
*  different level international player. But ultimately as it relates to this season, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2119.04s)]
*  they're better than I thought they were largely because of him, Bill. I do think they're sort of [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2123.52s)]
*  where LeBron was in year two, kind of a dicey playoff team. Nobody expects much, but ahead of [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2128.96s)]
*  schedule. So I think the Spurs are thrilled with where he is. But a team that makes more sense than [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2135.44s)]
*  those first couple of years of LeBron teams. I mean, he inherited such a bad roster those first [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2141.04s)]
*  couple of years. They, they spent three years just trying to extricate themselves from these awful [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2145.68s)]
*  roster decisions. And I think that oh, six season was the kind of the first time it was like, all [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2150.8s)]
*  right, this kind of looks like a team that LeBron should have. Wemby's further along. They have some [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  possible trade stuff if they wanted. My big thing, if they made me the Wemby consultant, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2160.48s)]
*  he needs to figure out where his like three spots on the floor are. Right. And I thought this was [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2167.04s)]
*  something when Duncan came into the league and he came in as a finished product almost because he [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2173.9199999999996s)]
*  had been in college for four years, but he had his spots, right? He was, he had right block jump hook. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2178.64s)]
*  He had that left, left a little bit further away, 10, 11 feet where he could shoot that bank shot [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2183.92s)]
*  or drive it over the lane and hit the jumper. Like he knew where his spots were. Wemby's spots [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2189.52s)]
*  are basically the three point line. And then he's showing signs of a possible dirt foul line, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2194.32s)]
*  something, but I don't know if he even knows what it is yet. Remember like how long it took Dirk to [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2201.36s)]
*  just figure out like top of the key. This is my domain. Now I'm, I'm now grabbing this and taking [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2207.0400000000004s)]
*  it. And I don't, for me, the Wemby spot I think would be the left block where he could either [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2212.88s)]
*  shoot a bank shot or a little 10 footer or go into the lane with a little running jump hook. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2219.2000000000003s)]
*  And I don't know how you would defend it, but he hasn't figured that out yet. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2224.4s)]
*  Yeah. I have never thought about it in these terms, but it's like, okay, post plays kind of [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2227.92s)]
*  dead. Here comes like the best big man of a generation. How is he going to get two points [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2231.6s)]
*  shots? And I love the Timmy, you know, the bank shot from the left side, you know, and bead is [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2236.32s)]
*  the free throw line face up guy. It's a good one. And it took eight years to figure out where his [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2241.76s)]
*  spot was and it's free throw line. Yeah. And I don't know, there's no manual. There's no like [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2247.0400000000004s)]
*  George Mike in tutorial video and how to drop step and get a half hook because we're not doing that [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2251.76s)]
*  anymore. So it's a cool thing again, and the all positive podcast is like, how is this guy going [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2256.5600000000004s)]
*  to figure it out? He clearly has the tools, but there's no manual to learn from here. Maybe it's [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2261.44s)]
*  MB a little bit. Maybe it's Yoke Hitch a little bit, but I think he has a higher ceiling as a [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2267.6s)]
*  score. Is it crazy? Then those guys do near the basketball hoop. So I don't know how he's going [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2271.68s)]
*  to get there, but that is, I think we're vibing on that. That's the same thing. What is his signature [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2277.04s)]
*  two point move going to be bill? I like the foul line area for him too, because we saw it with [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  Dirk. We saw it with them beat. We've seen him a couple others, just cause it's really hard to like [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2286.88s)]
*  send a second guy. You know, you can almost create enough space there where [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2290.72s)]
*  you can pass to either corner. You got like a guard over there. So maybe that'll be it. I'd [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2296.8799999999997s)]
*  love to see them find one more guy. Just for the record. All right. Well, and I just say, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2301.68s)]
*  my last thing, like shout out to Brian Wright and RC and all those guys for getting grownups in that, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2306.48s)]
*  like Harrison Barnes and Chris Paul. It really did let this happen. So let's, they do have another [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2311.3599999999997s)]
*  level to get to, and it's going to require some good front office craft to build this team around [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2316.88s)]
*  him. Yeah, there's, they have to be staring at Fox a little bit. I agree. That would be the guy [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2321.6s)]
*  I would be at least having a meeting about when we get back after new year's like, all right, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2331.6s)]
*  Hey guys, one 30, we're going to have our one and a half hour at the Aaron Fox meeting. And [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2336.56s)]
*  we've had our best three scouts watch his last 20 games. And what would this look like with [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2341.04s)]
*  one be at? You got to talk that out and really figure it out because this is a top 20 guy that [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2345.52s)]
*  might become available in a month. You know, my next one for the all positive NBA podcast, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2350.96s)]
*  and I couldn't be more delighted. I've already talked about them on the pod in the past, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2358.08s)]
*  so we don't have to spend too much time on it, but the Atlanta Hawks graduating from fantasy team [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2361.12s)]
*  that just made trades that Woody Johnson's kids would make for the jets. And then we're like, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2370.08s)]
*  we'll just put the Jean Tabor and Trey young together. By the way, I trade that I kind of [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2374.8s)]
*  liked when they did it. I, at the time I thought the Jean Tabor still played defense, but came to [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2378.8s)]
*  find out he didn't. The way they crafted this team, putting Trey with all of these wings and [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2383.52s)]
*  all of these interchangeable guys on defense who can help him in some ways out, or, you know, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2392.2400000000002s)]
*  the Daniels Murray trade, which was the trade of the year, and maybe the trade of the last couple [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2398.7200000000003s)]
*  years, the research pick who I just really like research. I liked him in the preseason. I like [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2402.88s)]
*  him during the season. He's 19 years old. He's playing 24 minutes a game. I don't know if you [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2409.36s)]
*  saw their comeback against Indiana when they scored 50 in the fourth quarter research was a big part [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2414.0s)]
*  of that. The, uh, the, they have two centers who basically can just rebound and finish lobs. And [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2419.6s)]
*  it's a team that was architected. I'm going to make up that word correctly. And I just want to [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2430.72s)]
*  appreciate the moment because so many, like, look at the Kings, you go the other way. We can talk [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2438.56s)]
*  about them in the all negative NBA pod, but the Kings doing all the fantasy basketball moves, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2442.88s)]
*  like DeMar DeRosa maybe has stuff left in the tank and on and on and on. And now they're a mess. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2448.08s)]
*  Atlanta, like just really smartly crafting a team that can exact the most out of Trey young [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2453.28s)]
*  because they couldn't, they knew they didn't really have a chance to Trey young had no value [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2459.36s)]
*  anymore. He was, they weren't going to be able, you're basically just selling them off for 40 [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2464.16s)]
*  cents on the dollar. Um, all the moves they made were great. And the fact that Hunter turned out [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2467.6s)]
*  to be a guy kind of belatedly, um, I just really liked the team there 18 and 15 now. And I think [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2474.0s)]
*  they're, I think they're a team that's not going to be a playing team. I think they're going to be [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2480.08s)]
*  one of the six playoff teams. I say, I see the same thing for them. Uh, they're 11 and four and [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2482.96s)]
*  their last 15 playing pretty good on both sides of the ball. Landry fields, Kyle, corporate great [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2488.32s)]
*  front office moves. I think the DeJante trade, the original one was, it didn't turn out very well, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2493.84s)]
*  but then sort of getting the edit undo and getting back Dyson Daniels and draft capital, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2500.1600000000003s)]
*  uh, has completely, completely refreshed the outlook in Atlanta. I think Trey young still has [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2506.8s)]
*  something to give. He's a terrific offensive player. And if you surround him with four great [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2514.88s)]
*  defensive players, you have a chance to, to, to be able to hide him on the defensive end. Uh, and [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2519.84s)]
*  that's what this current sort of block of wings lets them do. Obviously Dyson Daniels deserves [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2525.6800000000003s)]
*  all the shine for defensive player of the year. Candice. He is a great, did you see this with him? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2533.04s)]
*  No, I don't think New Orleans did either. It's again, it's sort of like Brunson's like if, if [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2539.28s)]
*  freaking New Orleans knew they had this, they would have straightened him. So I don't think [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2543.12s)]
*  anybody knew it. I mean, we all, he was always kind of interesting in the draft because he had [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2547.6s)]
*  the size and the athleticism and sort of this quirky playmaking thing. Um, but I don't think [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2552.96s)]
*  anybody knew he could do this. I don't think anybody, I don't think Atlanta knew he could do [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2558.88s)]
*  this. It just didn't seem like he could shoot. It always seemed like he had quick hands and he was [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2564.08s)]
*  something, but this is crazy to watch. I mean, you could argue just Murray for Daniels would [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2568.96s)]
*  have made sense, but yeah, he's, it was really interesting watching him guard LeBron a couple [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2575.04s)]
*  weeks ago. Yeah. Um, I mean, that was the one guy. Yeah, that was the one guy where this, it was like, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2579.52s)]
*  okay, well maybe you might be the best defensive perimeter guy in the league, but if somebody's [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2587.04s)]
*  six, nine, 270, that might still be a problem for you. But it seems like everybody else where he's [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2592.64s)]
*  really tough and what the Knicks should watch out for us. If we get Knicks Hawks in like around one [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2597.44s)]
*  and Daniels on Brunson is bad for the Knicks. Like that's just flat out not good. Oh, and like, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2604.48s)]
*  don't forget Trey young, you know, rolling the dice on the Knicks logo and he loves going up to [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2609.6s)]
*  that building. I mean, again, the Eastern conference, here we are again, positive podcast. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2614.88s)]
*  The Eastern conference is not, it is not the dumpster fire. We thought it was like early in [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2620.08s)]
*  the season bill in Atlanta, 11 and four in their last 15 Dyson Daniels has, has recharged their [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2625.12s)]
*  defensive identity. They have research, they're letting him grow. Uh, Deandre Hunter, as you [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2632.24s)]
*  mentioned is great. A Congo, they just have an identity. Quinn Snyder deserves some love here to [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2637.3599999999997s)]
*  figuring it out on the fly and maybe finding a place. There's some love for his wardrobe and his [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2642.4s)]
*  look too. So every time they cut them in the sidelines, I'm like, is this a bit, what's he [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2647.6s)]
*  doing? But Jacoby called it the Sally Jesse Raphael glasses. Uh, I think the great barrier thief is [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2652.88s)]
*  one of the great nicknames in the contemporary. I couldn't agree more. Great barrier thief is, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2660.48s)]
*  I don't know who came up with that, but kudos. Can I give you, um, what do you think Atlanta's [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2665.6800000000003s)]
*  over under as I'm Fandel right now? They're 18 and 15. So we're, so when, cause they update the winds. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2670.88s)]
*  What do you think they're, cause I've bet this twice and I might go back for thirds. What do you [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2677.28s)]
*  think it is right now? 43 and a half, 42 and a half. Like to me, they're, to me, they're top [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2681.04s)]
*  six teams. So right now it's Cleveland, Boston, Nick's zombie, the zombie magic at 2014, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2689.52s)]
*  Atlanta's fifth and Milwaukee's six. Cause they just had the, you know, they've had the Damiana [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  stuff. So they're only 16 and 14. And then underneath them is Miami, Indiana, Chicago, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2701.44s)]
*  Detroit, Philly lurking now at 13 and 17 with a chance to get to 500. If we'll see, they have a [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2706.24s)]
*  tough schedule in January. I'll be interested to see how many games a beat actually plays, but [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2714.3999999999996s)]
*  I think Atlanta is going to be a top 16. Quick Philly interlude. What did, what is your takeaway [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2718.8799999999997s)]
*  from that Christmas game? Uh, as a Boston guy, I just thought Philly played that game like it was [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2723.6s)]
*  a game seven in Boston played it like it was another game in the schedule and it's going to [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2730.4799999999996s)]
*  happen. I didn't take that much away from it. I think that's a great point. I think that's what [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2735.68s)]
*  Boston, they're going to get that every night. I mean, Indiana got them again. Like they're [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2739.8399999999997s)]
*  getting everybody's best welcome to a title defense. This is one of the reasons it's hard. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2743.9199999999996s)]
*  Everybody's like, Oh, okay, let's bring our a game. So I don't think they were, yeah, I don't think [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2747.6s)]
*  they were ready for what was going to happen. Here's the Celtic stretch coming up that I'm [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2753.9199999999996s)]
*  going to be really interested in Thursday at Minnesota, Friday at Houston, Sunday at Oklahoma [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2758.64s)]
*  city, Tuesday at Denver. And we're going to have a much better idea after those games. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2765.2s)]
*  They'll play two awesome games, probably have one shitty game and then one either or game would be [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2771.9199999999996s)]
*  my guess. But last year they would have ripped through and went all four of those games. And [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2776.96s)]
*  that's the difference with that. Last year's team had a chip on its shoulder. They wanted to rip [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2780.8799999999997s)]
*  through the schedule. Every time they lost, it felt like an accident this year. We'll see. Like, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2786.16s)]
*  could they go on four on those? I wouldn't be surprised. All right. The all positive [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2790.64s)]
*  NBA podcast returns with Kurt Goldsberry is next one. What do you got? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2795.12s)]
*  Inside the NBA is perfect sports television and we've seen it be saved from potential doom. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2800.56s)]
*  It was doomed Bill Simmons. The inside the NBA was, was left for dead there for a few months. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2808.24s)]
*  And, you know, I got a chance to visit with those guys in Atlanta when I was doing those data casts [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2814.3199999999997s)]
*  and I love it. I think I speak for millions of NBA fans. Unlike the NFL, unlike major league [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2819.84s)]
*  baseball, NBA fans have this incredible pre and post game show. And I think, you know, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2826.0s)]
*  there was the world's worst take a couple of weeks ago that it was actually bad for the NBA. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2832.32s)]
*  That's terrible. Charles Barkley is probably the GOAT sports media guy since Madden probably. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2836.6400000000003s)]
*  And I just love that we have this Turner crew and this TNT crew. And I'm happy that we're [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2843.84s)]
*  going to have it going forward. I have no notes. I do worry about them a little bit with how ESPN [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2849.6s)]
*  does basketball and whether they'll have enough time to actually do content before, during and [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2856.4s)]
*  after games. Yeah, I think I share some of that concern as a veteran. I think the Turner people [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2861.68s)]
*  share some of that concern too. All right. My next one for the all positive NBA pod, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2867.04s)]
*  Brooklyn as an old school tanking trade machine team. They said it couldn't be done with the [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2874.48s)]
*  second apron era. They said, they said the Picasso, the trade machine wouldn't be able to paint [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2881.44s)]
*  during February. Well, guess what? Brooklyn's already made two trades. They have this giant [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2887.52s)]
*  Ben Simmons expiring. They have a determined thing to be bad. They have Cam Johnson, who I think [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2892.48s)]
*  there's going to be a little bit of a fun bidding war and he actually is a tradable contract. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2901.84s)]
*  Don't sleep on Nick Claxton. Maybe, you know, he's a contract in the low mid twenties as a [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2905.6800000000003s)]
*  rim protector kind of alley-oop guy. Like could Atlanta turn Capella into Nick Claxton? I don't [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2912.88s)]
*  even know if that makes them better, but there's stuff like that floating around with them. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2918.8s)]
*  But then big picture, if they do this correctly, I mean, let's say I think they're definitely [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2923.2000000000003s)]
*  trading Cam Johnson. He's 28 years old. They should. They definitely want to get worse. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2928.4s)]
*  If they asked to trade at Claxton, they'd be like $120 million under the cap heading into the summer, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2932.7200000000003s)]
*  which now gives everybody leverage. Like somebody like Jimmy Butler or Miami is like, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2940.0s)]
*  where are you going to go? And he's like, well, I actually do have a place to go. It's right there. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2944.32s)]
*  It's Brooklyn. They become leverage for Zion. Basically they become the island of misfit toys [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2947.04s)]
*  for every player and team that we don't know what they're going to do this summer. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2955.04s)]
*  I really appreciate that they exist because if they didn't, I don't know what we would do for fake [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2959.44s)]
*  trades. It's like Walmart on Black Friday, the Brooklyn Nets in January of 2025. Cam Johnson [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2963.44s)]
*  right now, lightning deal. But to Sean Marks' credit, like one of the worst things that can [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2971.84s)]
*  happen to a front office is these trade demands. And he had, he lived through one of them and then [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2977.2799999999997s)]
*  got back these pieces, Bill. And now the Durant trades spin it off into future team building [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2982.56s)]
*  resources. So I know they want to keep their draft pick. I had one of the team sources say, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2988.72s)]
*  Hey, if we start winning, watch out, we're going to start trading players. That's what they've done [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2993.84s)]
*  already. Schroeder is out. And I think Cam Johnson is out. I guess I should say that. Yeah. I should [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=2998.0s)]
*  say Cam Johnson is likely, everybody could- Cam Johnson's on his way out. They're trading [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3007.68s)]
*  Cam Johnson. Slide them into any team in the league. They get better. And in Claxton, I agree [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3012.32s)]
*  with Ben Simmons. I don't think so, but maybe that would be a Sean Marks masterpiece. But I think [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3017.1200000000003s)]
*  they're not done. And I think Claxton and Cam Johnson are the ones to watch. Maybe even Cam [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3023.52s)]
*  Thomas for somebody like the Houston Rockets that don't have a go-to score. But I definitely think [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3028.0800000000004s)]
*  Cam Johnson is the number one player to watch on the trade market right now. Well, you mentioned [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3034.2400000000002s)]
*  this on the Ringer NBA show yesterday. There's also a really fun scenario where Cam Thomas is [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3038.4s)]
*  the only guy left just shooting 40 shots a game. And it's like just the perfect- could Cam Johnson [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3042.7200000000003s)]
*  average- could he basically do Kobe 2006 for the last two months of the season? Cam Thomas has 81 [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3049.12s)]
*  points. Oh my God. Yeah. I stole that from you. I think when you saw the scoring title odds at the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3057.76s)]
*  beginning of the year, you were high on Cam Thomas. Yeah. Don't count him out. He could shoot 40 [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3064.32s)]
*  times a game a few times down the stretch here. What do you have for your next one? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3068.4s)]
*  I mean, I think we have to talk about Nikola Jokic, dude. I think- [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3073.76s)]
*  Twist my arm. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3077.76s)]
*  10 years ago. I got a text yesterday and a friend of mine was like, hey, you have Jokic on a TV, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3079.84s)]
*  right? He has a chance to get a 40-20-10. Like, I'll put them on now. I wasn't going to watch Denver, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3086.0800000000004s)]
*  Utah. There were better games, but fine. I feel like they should broadcast games differently for [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3091.92s)]
*  the Nuggets because I just want to watch Jokic. I just want a Jokic cam, the whole game, particularly [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3097.36s)]
*  on offense. Oh, like the 22 man in football where they just have the wide shot just focused on him [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3102.8s)]
*  doing stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Like the NBA 2K, my player, but I think he's about to turn 30. We have Jokic, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3106.96s)]
*  Wemba at 20, LeBron at 40. This is the guy in his prime right now. Yeah. If you would have told me [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3114.0s)]
*  10 years ago at the midpoint of the 2010s, Spurs are defending champs, Warriors are about to take [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3119.12s)]
*  the lead by a storm. If you would have told me in that time that the best player in the world [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3124.24s)]
*  in the mid part of the 2020s was the giant Serbian center who's not very fast, not quick. I would [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3128.24s)]
*  have said you were crazy, but one of the things I love about NBA basketball, Bill, is you don't know [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3134.96s)]
*  what the next thing is going to be. And you've alluded to this, I think in your NBA ratings [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3139.52s)]
*  monologue. It's like, we don't know what's going to happen in this league. And I think he's a [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3144.8799999999997s)]
*  perfect embodiment of sort of one of those unicorn moments. We're like, what? This guy's going to come [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3149.8399999999997s)]
*  along. Here's a stat. He's currently averaging more points per game than Shaq ever did in his [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3154.24s)]
*  entire career, more rebounds per game than Tim Duncan ever did in his entire career. He is [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3159.2799999999997s)]
*  averaging more assists per game than Chris Paul has ever done in his entire career. And he's making [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3165.04s)]
*  49% of his threes, which is like Kyle Korver numbers. This is insanity. Watch him people. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3169.52s)]
*  This is the best show in pro basketball. Yeah. Right now, third in assists, second in points, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3175.92s)]
*  third in rebounds. Where is he on the, he's, what's he shooting on the threes now? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3185.68s)]
*  It's down to 49%. But he's leading the league in threes, 49%. So second in points, third rebound, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3192.32s)]
*  third assist, first and three points shooting. It's fucking crazy. That'll never happen again. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3199.68s)]
*  It's like an NBA 2K, make your own player thing and you move all the bars to 99, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3206.88s)]
*  except for rim protection and like fitness or whatever. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3211.6s)]
*  But you made the guy chubby. I have some quick ones. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3217.84s)]
*  The pistons are not the pistons anymore. The pistons were so sad for so long. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3224.8s)]
*  And now they're a fun watch. I would rank them as my stealth most fun Eastern conference watch [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3229.2799999999997s)]
*  behind the Hawks. Cade, I think is one of the 16 or 17 has to be on the all-star team guys [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3234.24s)]
*  for what he's doing night to night. And they also have an interesting trade bait piece that I'm not [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3241.04s)]
*  sure they even think about doing this year. Maybe they do, but they have Harris and Hardaway at 41 [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3246.16s)]
*  million combined. They have all kinds of flexibility in all kinds of directions. And I'm just watching [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3251.7599999999998s)]
*  them because they're right around 500. The East is a little bit weird after that six spot. Cade is [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3258.32s)]
*  a guy. Ivy is compared to when Monty Williams was playing killing Hayes over him. That's what a [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3264.48s)]
*  dramatic come around that's been. I like what they've done with Beasley and Harris and Hardaway. Just [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3271.28s)]
*  same thing you talked about with San Antonio. We're just like veterans who've been in the league for [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3276.4s)]
*  a while, who kind of know how to show up and just be professional. But there's also like, Hey, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3280.88s)]
*  could this be like a Jimmy Butler, like out of nowhere team? Could this be like, just fuck it. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3286.32s)]
*  Let's add Zach Levine to this. Like, could this be a, I don't know who, like go through the league, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3294.32s)]
*  go find guys that might be, could this be a Cam Johnson team? I feel like there's a trade for them [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3299.92s)]
*  and I think they should do it because Cade's really, really, really good and way better than [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3306.48s)]
*  I thought he was going to be. I think he's an absolute guy. I would love to see them get one more guy. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3311.6s)]
*  Yeah, I love Cade Cunningham. I think he's finally clipped into what we thought he could be at the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3317.68s)]
*  draft. And I agree. I mean, coaching changes matter. And I think this new coach has brought [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3322.88s)]
*  in sort of a new culture and that term is overused, but it just feels differently. I love [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3329.84s)]
*  B. Stu, by the way, is my favorite league pass player, Isaiah Stewart. You never know what's [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3336.64s)]
*  going to happen when he's out there. Great bench guy. I wish the Celtics had him. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3340.64s)]
*  But sort of like Houston last year, there's something cooking, but we don't know what it is. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3345.12s)]
*  Right. Orlando two years ago. Like, yeah, you see there's, you can see the breadcrumbs to [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3350.7999999999997s)]
*  something really good happening with them. And I think they've at least reached that point. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3356.64s)]
*  OKC a couple of years ago. Yeah. The thing I always say Bill is like the road from bad to good [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3360.08s)]
*  always has to go through average or mediocre on the way, you know, and that's where they are. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3365.68s)]
*  And that's a good sign. This is where they wanted to be this year. And again, like the Spurs, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3370.56s)]
*  they're a little bit better than we thought. Yeah. And I think they should be excited about [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3374.16s)]
*  the next couple of years in Detroit. Goldsberry, they just did this trip. They did a three, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3378.7999999999997s)]
*  a three game trip at Phoenix, at Lakers, at Kings, won all of them. Yeah. And it had a dramatic, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3385.44s)]
*  come from behind win against the Kings, too. So that's one I wanted to mention the Pistons [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3393.68s)]
*  and and I wanted to mention the Zombie Magic really quick. They're 20 and 14. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3398.32s)]
*  Palos played five games. He's really played four and a half games because he got hurt. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3408.48s)]
*  Franz has played 25 games, really 24 and a half because he got hurt. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3412.96s)]
*  They're shooting 30.8% from three. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3417.44s)]
*  They are running crunch time plays for Tristan De Silva and Jalen Suggs. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3424.0s)]
*  They lost Mo Wagner, who you'd be like, oh, they lost Mo Wagner like Mo Wagner was important for [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3429.44s)]
*  them. And they're 20 and 14. And they're just hanging around. And they're a really hard team [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3434.3199999999997s)]
*  to play. Like they beat the Celtics last week. And I'm watching it going, I don't understand [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3440.08s)]
*  how we're going to lose this game. But it made sense when you're watching it because Orlando was [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3445.2s)]
*  just ready for the challenge playing super hard. Mosley to me, I wasn't sure about Mosley, but [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3448.4799999999996s)]
*  what he's getting out of that team, Atkinson is the coach of the year favorite. But I think Mosley, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3456.3999999999996s)]
*  this team finishes with like 46, 47 wins, not having Palo, not having Franz. That's fucking insane. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3461.12s)]
*  So he's got to be in there. I left them for dead two or three times. Oh, OK. They can't do [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3468.72s)]
*  this without Palo. Then Franz shows up and then Franz goes out and then they start Suggs is the [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3474.0s)]
*  guy. And now they lose Mo. They made a run in the end season tournament. And yeah, look, if they get [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3479.76s)]
*  whole before the Eastern Conference playoffs, I don't care if you're Cleveland, Boston or New [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3487.76s)]
*  York. Nobody wants to see that. Nobody wants to. That's the worst case scenario. Yeah. The worst [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3492.24s)]
*  case scenario, eight seed. If you're the one seed, you're like, really? I got to these guys? Now [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3497.28s)]
*  they're healthy because I assume Palo and Franz will be back. So I wanted to mention them. What [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3501.2s)]
*  do you have? Because I have two more. I have sort of. Well, I think this will sort of segue. I think [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3506.56s)]
*  the magic and the Rockets and the Thunder sort of reminding us that the NBA is a young man's game. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3511.8399999999997s)]
*  But on the flip side of that, superstars are sort of aging gracefully, but in a weird way. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3518.3199999999997s)]
*  Like we're able to go see LeBron. Like I was able to take my family to see LeBron in San Antonio [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3523.6s)]
*  this year. Stefan, Katie, like as a Larry Bird scholar, Magic Johnson scholar, you know, it's [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3528.8s)]
*  not always, you don't always get to see these guys after 35. And I think one of the cool things [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3537.04s)]
*  is we can go see LeBron James in 2025 and we can go see Kevin Durant and Stefan Curry in their [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3542.4s)]
*  late thirties. And it's not like a nostalgia act. These guys are great. Like what LeBron and Stefan [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3548.0800000000004s)]
*  did on Christmas. And I know you talked about it was awesome. They might not be championship [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3555.36s)]
*  contenders, but again, in terms of the depth of league pass offerings, some of these old dudes [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3560.48s)]
*  are bringing special things to league pass on a regular basis. And 37 year olds aren't necessarily [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3566.0800000000004s)]
*  sort of dead weight anymore. And I think that's great for the league. I would throw in Chris Paul [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3573.0400000000004s)]
*  too. I had actually for the all positive playing off that the fact that the Lakers aren't a disaster. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3577.76s)]
*  I'm going to remove my abject hatred for the Lakers and the Yankees, the two teams I hate the [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3583.6s)]
*  most. It's also not good when the Lakers are bad. It's the same thing. Like we talked about the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3588.88s)]
*  Knicks, like the league's just more fun when the Lakers are competent or good. Even I would admit [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3595.6s)]
*  that and I can't stand them. There was a moment when this seemed like the season was going to get [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3600.48s)]
*  really dark and that the, the, this LeBron season was going to get dark. The season was going to get [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3606.64s)]
*  dark. The JJ thing was going to get dark. The defense was absolutely abominable. They kind of [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3612.64s)]
*  rallied rallied around it and passed it. Um, LeBron going away for eight days. I think the [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3618.08s)]
*  schedule really helped. They really lucked out right as things were creating or all of a sudden [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3624.16s)]
*  we had that NBA cup thing. They've had some, some good schedule luck, right? They got to play [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3627.92s)]
*  Sacramento three times right as Sacramento was completely falling apart. But I feel like they've [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3633.04s)]
*  kind of saved this a little bit, you know, like the fact that Max Christie's a competent rotation [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3638.8s)]
*  guy now, he wasn't a month ago. The fact that they were able to get Phinney Smith for what, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3645.36s)]
*  basically giving up nothing. Um, they're not going to be bad, I guess is my point. And I think if [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3649.52s)]
*  you're talking about like, I don't want to watch LeBron on an awful team, like this guy carried the [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3655.84s)]
*  league this century, you know, and, um, at least they're relevant, I guess is my point. I think [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3660.48s)]
*  them just sucking and not having their pick. It's just like a dark story. And that at least [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3667.76s)]
*  that's not going to happen. And now I want to pour gasoline on myself and set myself on fire. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3672.48s)]
*  Well, in the all positive NBA podcast, I think, you know, the NBA is a collection of markets. And [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3680.7200000000003s)]
*  when I lay in New York or relevant, it's good. It's good for television. It's good for, for, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3685.6800000000003s)]
*  for matchups like cell, it's also good cause they're on national TV all the time because [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3690.1600000000003s)]
*  those are the teams they put on. So we might as well have them be good over terrible. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3694.64s)]
*  And one of the things that Brian Windhorst always talks about is the league also always backloads [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3698.8799999999997s)]
*  LeBron's second half of the schedule. He always has a lot of national TV games after football ends, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3704.08s)]
*  you know, so they could have a really tough go, but I think they have another trade to make. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3709.44s)]
*  I love Dorian Phinney Smith there. I, it took like three years too long to get an actual three point [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3715.2799999999997s)]
*  shooting wing back in his life. I still think they're one or two pieces away, but if they have [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3720.8s)]
*  luck with health, I believe in JJ Reddick as a coach, I believe in LeBron James as somebody who [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3727.1200000000003s)]
*  can sort of figure out how to adore through this marathon season and get to the playoffs in one [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3732.8s)]
*  piece. Anthony Davis is the biggest question mark. If they can add one, maybe two more pieces around [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3738.8s)]
*  those guys. Again, nobody wants to see them in the playoffs. I think people want to see them in [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3745.1200000000003s)]
*  the playoffs. Yeah. I wouldn't mind seeing them in the playoffs. I'm just, the question for me is [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3750.64s)]
*  did I want to see them at all during the season? And now at least we can say, all right, this is [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3756.56s)]
*  kind of a fun team. You know, come on in the playoffs, I want to see them. They're not, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3760.8799999999997s)]
*  yeah, I think they're not making like round three in the playoffs. Come on. Ask me again, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3767.12s)]
*  to the all star break. Okay. Get me to the all star break. I think there's a potential for either [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3771.2799999999997s)]
*  answer there. Admittedly, I don't think Memphis would be scared if it showed up. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3776.0s)]
*  LeBron's too old. I don't see him being able to, once we get into the part of the schedule where [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3782.16s)]
*  you have to play like every other day, I just don't see it. I don't see how he would have the [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3787.6s)]
*  energy. We saw in the beginning when they were playing in big minutes, he lasted a month. He [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3791.76s)]
*  had to take an eight day sabbatical. Davis is the one, maybe he could throw the team on his back. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3795.92s)]
*  Phinney Smith, I've always liked, I thought his quotes were really interesting after the trade. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3802.48s)]
*  Like he's a really smart player. He's the kind of guy that's worked well with LeBron, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3806.96s)]
*  where he was talking about how they used him in Brooklyn. And it was a lot of like top of the key [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3810.88s)]
*  threes and a lot of him with the ball. And he's like, I'm actually better off if I'm in the corner. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3815.84s)]
*  That was when I was at my best with Luca. Now I get to go back to that. I was like, all right, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3820.1600000000003s)]
*  this guy, this would be a good one for them. I have another one for you. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3824.1600000000003s)]
*  This is mostly positive. There's a negative component to it, but I don't want to focus on that. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3830.16s)]
*  Zion Trades. This has been a big topic on techs and talking to different people who know things [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3837.2s)]
*  and people involved with teams. What is Zion as a trade asset? What's he worth? Would you do it? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3848.56s)]
*  Would you do it? Is this salvageable? Like that ESPN wrote a piece about it this week, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3857.52s)]
*  about how goofy his deal is. Basically it's not guaranteed for the last three years, but [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3863.6800000000003s)]
*  you can keep picking it up. So it's almost like an NFL contract with no real salary cap ramifications. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3868.7200000000003s)]
*  Somebody's going to talk themselves into it. If you're New Orleans, you probably have to cut bait [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3875.6000000000004s)]
*  at some point. I think it's going to be a really fun story over the next six weeks, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3880.32s)]
*  which is why I put it in the all positive NBA storyline because I still think Zion's incredibly [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3887.6000000000004s)]
*  talented. I think he plays for the single worst franchise you could play for in the NBA at this [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3893.52s)]
*  point. I want to see him go to a place that will treat him like a plant and water him every day [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3899.04s)]
*  and put him in the sun and put little chemicals and try to help him grow versus where he is now, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3905.2799999999997s)]
*  which is the worst situation you can be in. Would you trade for Zion? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3911.52s)]
*  It depends on who I am. I think if risk were a human being, it would wear number one on its New [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3917.2799999999997s)]
*  Orleans Jersey. I think that's what we're looking at. There's just so much risk there. And if I'm [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3922.56s)]
*  a good team, no. If I feel good about my team now or in the next couple of years, I'm not going to [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3926.64s)]
*  give up anything relevant to bring in that kind of risk. If I'm the Kings, if I'm the Blazers, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3931.6s)]
*  I'm having very different conversations because I need something. I need an injection of something. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3938.24s)]
*  And if that guy turns it around, major if he's one of the best players in the league, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3944.24s)]
*  he's one of the best players in the league. The guy we've seen at his absolute peak [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3950.4s)]
*  is unstoppable in the paint. It's Shaq, Giannis and Zion, the top paint scorers of the 21st century [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3955.44s)]
*  by season. He's that good. If he gets into some sort of rhythm with availability and health and [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3963.44s)]
*  nutrition, it's worth looking. There's whiteboard discussions happening in struggling NBA offices [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3971.2s)]
*  right now. And yet that's not what can happen. He can't go to the Kings. He can't go to Portland. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3980.08s)]
*  This goes back to my plan analogy. I get your point. Those franchises are like, hey, this could [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3989.44s)]
*  be an incredible role of the dice. To me, he has to go to an awesome organization that will really [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=3995.52s)]
*  put some thought and love and care into this. And to me, it's Miami or San Antonio. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4001.2s)]
*  If I'm Miami, this is the guy I'm really thinking about, especially if this Butler thing keeps going [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4009.9199999999996s)]
*  sideways and could it be a three-way or whatever? Could we get Zion? Could we save this? Could we [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4017.52s)]
*  salvage this? Could we turn him into an awesome asset? And is there a world two years from now [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4025.12s)]
*  where we have Bam and Zion and Tyler Hero? And that's like our version of a big three, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4030.16s)]
*  because Hero's been fantastic this year. He's just a really, really elite offensive player. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4033.92s)]
*  Now you're not getting anywhere. If Michael Pena wrote about this today for the ringer, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4039.2s)]
*  if Bam and Hero are your two guys, you're not doing anything. You still need that awesome somebody. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4046.56s)]
*  So Zion and then San Antonio is one of those. If San Antonio traded for Zion, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4052.48s)]
*  guess what the reaction in the league would be? Oh, shit. That would be it. It's like, oh no. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4058.0s)]
*  Wemby and Zion? Oh no. And I think those are the two teams. Maybe there's some others, but [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4066.8s)]
*  those are the two I was focused on. You sent him to Chicago, you sent him to Detroit. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4073.36s)]
*  I don't know how it's different. Yeah, it's super depressing, right? Because he still has a very [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4078.88s)]
*  high ceiling. And a lot of front office are simply not going to take the risk. It's a non-starter [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4085.68s)]
*  for a lot of the general managers around the league. That kind of risk in this NBA where [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4092.3999999999996s)]
*  you can't have one bad contract and compete for a championship. It seems like that's where we're [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4098.96s)]
*  going. But the contract isn't nearly as risky as what makes this so fascinating. It's a risk, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4103.5199999999995s)]
*  but it's also not a risk. It depends what you give up. It's non-guaranteed next year, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4110.8s)]
*  something like that. There's weight stuff and there's game stuff where over and over again, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4115.28s)]
*  you can get out of it. So, we'll see what happens. But I just keep thinking to the teams that if they [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4120.4s)]
*  traded for him, what the reaction would be. In Miami and San Antonio are the two where people [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4131.36s)]
*  are like, oh fuck. Oh man, they're going to figure this out with them. We've just seen it in the NBA. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4137.04s)]
*  And I don't know what else to do with that New Orleans team because Ingram clearly has no trade [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4142.32s)]
*  value. As an expiring free agent, they would have traded him already. They're in a weird spot with [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4147.12s)]
*  CJ and Dejante who they just traded for. They have all these picks. I don't know what to do. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4152.32s)]
*  They have really good tradable pieces beyond the line. I don't know if they want to do that, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4160.96s)]
*  but they got some shooters and some wing defenders that would make every team in the NBA look a [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4165.04s)]
*  little bit better. So, if they want to press the explode button, I think they have some draft [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4170.0s)]
*  capital and maybe some young players they can get back. And guess what? Nobody wants to go there. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4176.24s)]
*  But now we're not being positive anymore. Do you have one more? Because I have two more. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4180.64s)]
*  This one is sort of in jest, but I love the Washington Wizards because they let you [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4185.92s)]
*  see the GM's vision of every opponent. So, if your team is playing the Wizards, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4192.96s)]
*  I recommend you go watch it because this is what the front office envisioned when they put their [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4197.36s)]
*  team together. Whatever they're going to get against the Wizards, clean looks, layups, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4203.2s)]
*  great stops. I encourage everybody to go. It's almost like the Washington Generals. The Wizards [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4209.04s)]
*  are one of the best teams to go watch right now at home. If your team's playing the Wizards at [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4215.759999999999s)]
*  their home arena, go see it, folks. This is the best your team's going to look all year. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4220.719999999999s)]
*  It's like scrimmaging in a hotel conference. What are those rooms called? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4225.5199999999995s)]
*  The draft workout video against the Chairs that you always call out. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4231.76s)]
*  Well, playing off what you just said in the All Positive NBA Draft, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4236.48s)]
*  I kind of love how weird the 2024 draft is and how many guys I kind of like. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4240.8s)]
*  Reese Asche mentioned him already. Steph Castle, all in. He's a little bit of a rookie while we're [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4246.72s)]
*  saying, but I'm all in. Messi on the Pelicans. He's a real center. I think he's like 15 years old, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4252.8s)]
*  but he's definitely a real center who will get a big contract. Jared McCain. This Jalen Welles kid [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4259.68s)]
*  on Memphis. Zach Eady on Memphis, who's averaging like 11 and 8 and you feel his presence in some [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4265.84s)]
*  of these games. And there's matchups against certain teams where it's kind of, I really liked [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4275.360000000001s)]
*  him in the draft because I just felt like there's going to be games and nights where he just sucks [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4280.64s)]
*  to play against. You know, it's like we don't have a guy. Poor Zingas is out tonight. Now we have Lee [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4284.88s)]
*  Carnett, you know, trying to stop Zach Eady. Dalton Connect. I like Donovan Klingon. Tristan [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4290.160000000001s)]
*  De Silva was a pretty polarizing prospect, but I think he's been a borderland revelation on the [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4298.56s)]
*  magic. Bob Carrington, who a lot of people liked. I don't think Sar, I'm not willing to say he's a [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4304.72s)]
*  bust. I think there's something there. I really like Bud Zelis. I don't know how much you've watched [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4311.92s)]
*  him on Chicago, but I almost feel like they have to trade Zach Levine just to get him to play. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4318.240000000001s)]
*  I like the way that guy, I like how he runs the floor. I like how athletic he is. I'd like him. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4322.88s)]
*  And I think he's a little feisty. He's got a little chip on his shoulder. And then Ron Holland [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4328.64s)]
*  and Dillingham and Jacoby Walter. There's something there with all three of those guys. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4333.12s)]
*  So that's a lot of guys that I think all have a chance to be a starter in the NBA, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4340.0s)]
*  which is basically what we look for in the draft. There's no high ceiling superstar, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4344.8s)]
*  Wembe type version, but it's a fun draft. Do you like this draft or am I overreacting? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4348.5599999999995s)]
*  I think if you contextualize it like you did, yeah, I like it. I think it's going to go down [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4354.32s)]
*  history. It's a relatively weak class, especially sandwiched by the Wembe draft. And then what [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4358.88s)]
*  we're getting in the Cooper flag class. I love Steph Castle. I'm disappointed one player you [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4363.04s)]
*  didn't mention Reed Shepard, who I wanted to be better than that. We just haven't seen him. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4369.12s)]
*  We haven't really seen him yet. He's kind of, well, that's in a related story. He's not, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4373.76s)]
*  he's not shooting the ball well and he's not shooting the ball well. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4378.24s)]
*  It's hard for him to find justification to get minutes, especially in a Houston environment [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4382.16s)]
*  where they're trying to win games. And they're trying to play defense and there are two seeds [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4387.28s)]
*  and they don't have time for a project. Hey, can you be Mark Price someday? They don't want to, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4391.12s)]
*  they don't care. They want to win games. Yeah. But when you're drafted that high bill, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4395.84s)]
*  right? Like I don't care if you're two seed that player you're drafted in that slot. You [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4400.0s)]
*  should find a rotation minutes, but I've been disappointed. I'm not done with him by any [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4403.5199999999995s)]
*  means, but I think the other players you mentioned are the Silva. I think is the one that jumps out [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4410.0s)]
*  is like, what? Okay. And again, this Orlando team, this culture next man up mentality, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4414.24s)]
*  he's great. Don't connect has been a big piece of why the Lakers are above water right now. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4419.5199999999995s)]
*  And a reshasha is going to be good. I think the Hawks made the right choice in retrospect. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4426.24s)]
*  If we redrafted, it would be hard for me to put anybody above him right now. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4431.76s)]
*  If you redrafted, would you, would you go reshasha? If you're the Hawks, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4437.5199999999995s)]
*  I think he fits into what they're doing. Like we're talking about it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4440.639999999999s)]
*  For, for, for what they are and what they're trying to be probably makes the most sense. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4443.12s)]
*  I still really like castle. I liked him the most heading into the draft. Um, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4448.4800000000005s)]
*  I just think he has it. There's that guy has all the, he checks all the boxes of what I want. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4455.52s)]
*  And the shooting, I think we'll get there eventually, but for them, I think you're right. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4461.6s)]
*  I think for, if you're just trying to have these interchangeable, tall athletic dudes, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4465.68s)]
*  he makes more sense for them. So check out Bud's Ellis though. I'm, I'm, I'm in on him. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4471.2s)]
*  They might've actually stumbled into a one of them. All right. Here's, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4476.5599999999995s)]
*  here's another one I had for you. So, and this is coming off. I went, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4480.4s)]
*  I took my daughter to the Quipper game the other night. I got to give them credit, man. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4485.04s)]
*  That is the best NBA arena hands down. Best atmosphere. Um, everything, everything Ballmer [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4489.36s)]
*  did where there's like no TVs in the lobbies. There's no TVs in the clubs. There's no TVs. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4497.2s)]
*  When you're going to buy a hot dog, everything is built around, get back into your seats. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4502.639999999999s)]
*  He wants people in there. He's got that whole section behind the court that really does. They [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4506.639999999999s)]
*  start chance. They do all kinds of things. There's more energy at those games than Laker games. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4511.599999999999s)]
*  Like they, they really have flipped this where the Lakers now look like they're the rinky dig [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4518.24s)]
*  franchise and with the staple center, which is just old though. Um, and doesn't have the same [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4523.28s)]
*  vibe as this Quipper thing. This is the first time the Quippers have ever turned the tables on the [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4528.48s)]
*  Lakers and made them feel like they're just kind of more modern and more on it. Like the Lakers [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4534.719999999999s)]
*  still have bigger stars, but I'll tell you this, that letting Paul George go over the third, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4543.679999999999s)]
*  fourth year thing, they did offer him three years, so I don't want to praise them too much, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4551.6s)]
*  but not going for trying to patch it together with, with defense, roll guys, flexibility, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4555.68s)]
*  and then banking on Harden and Powell being able to carry all the offense. It works. Dan Gundy on [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4561.280000000001s)]
*  the defense. It works. They're really well coached, smart team that's taken advantage of this crazy. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4569.200000000001s)]
*  You mentioned it earlier with aging superstars, Harden, this is the best he's looked in a while. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4576.64s)]
*  I don't think he had never has the ball too much. I think he's found the right balance of, uh, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4582.160000000001s)]
*  he takes over when they need him, but he doesn't have it all the time. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4587.52s)]
*  And I think they're really hard. They win these games at the end of games. Like you watch like [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4591.12s)]
*  the last five minutes, like I feel like they're going to get stops. What they're getting from [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4594.72s)]
*  Zubots, who I just want to mention was traded for Mike Mascala by magic Johnson and the Lakers. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4598.88s)]
*  One of the worst trades the last 10 years. Um, but they have an actual home court advantage. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4605.36s)]
*  I think they're a playoff team and I was completely wrong on them. I thought they're going to suck. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4610.4s)]
*  They're good. I'll go one step further. I mean, there's a crazy what if there, if, if Kauai [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4614.719999999999s)]
*  can be 88% of Kauai Leonard for the last few months of the regular season, I love this team. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4620.719999999999s)]
*  I love their coach. James Harden remains somehow underrated. Norman Powell has been a revelation [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4628.5599999999995s)]
*  but if Kauai Leonard can come back and have one really good five months stretch here, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4635.839999999999s)]
*  that's a pretty dangerous team. Yeah. Cause here are the minutes he's taking. He would be taking [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4642.639999999999s)]
*  coffee's playing almost 25 minutes a game. Porter was playing 20 minutes a game. Derek Jones said [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4648.16s)]
*  they're going to need even when Kauai comes back. And then, uh, but tomb was playing 18 minutes [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4654.24s)]
*  a game. So they have minutes where it's just, he's an immediate upgrade of, of this kind of patchwork, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4658.799999999999s)]
*  you know, wings that they have. Um, I'm with you. I'll tell you this body language doctor [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4664.64s)]
*  was really studying them. Um, happiest I've seen Kauai on the bench in a couple of years, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4670.08s)]
*  a lot of Kauai Harden stuff during the timeouts, Kauai at one point in the fourth quarter, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4677.68s)]
*  harder ones are playing and they were talking during timeout and Kauai was doing the exaggerated [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4682.72s)]
*  overlap thing with hardened. Like it seems like they actually like each other. The vibes are [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4687.28s)]
*  great. Everyone seems like they love being Gundy and in general, like I, I think, I don't think [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4691.36s)]
*  they're going to go away was my takeaway from, uh, from what I've watched, but also seeing them in [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4697.04s)]
*  person. Like it was interesting. Golden state finally did the one thing I don't think teams [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4702.24s)]
*  realized that they should do with nobody in the T on the Quippers can dribble. I don't know if [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4707.92s)]
*  you've noticed this, they can dribble on the half court, like hard and obviously could dribble, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4711.759999999999s)]
*  but nobody wants to dribble the first 50 feet of the court. So it'll be like Christon, it'll be [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4716.0s)]
*  hardened who doesn't want to work at all. Uh, Norman Powell, they, they really don't have anybody. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4721.28s)]
*  And I was with my daughter and we're watching, I'm like, I don't understand why they won't press. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4726.96s)]
*  I don't understand why people don't press the Clippers. I'm saying to my daughter who knows [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4730.96s)]
*  barely knows anything about basketball. And then the word started pressing in the fourth quarter [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4734.639999999999s)]
*  and they started getting all these turnovers and she's like, dad, how'd you know? And I was like, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4738.719999999999s)]
*  cause nobody on the Clippers could dribble, but that's so that's their one weakness is they don't [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4743.84s)]
*  have like that. You know, I think pressure is an issue for them. Let me ask you this, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4747.76s)]
*  Bill, do you feel like that arena will bring a home court advantage to those Clippers in the [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4752.72s)]
*  playoffs? Yes, I do. I really do. I really Jay, even that game, there were Warriors fans at that [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4758.64s)]
*  game Saturday night, but the Cooper fans were loud and I think they liked the team. The hardened [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4766.400000000001s)]
*  thing, I just can't believe cause he was my least favorite player to see in person and actually kind [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4771.360000000001s)]
*  of enjoyed the two games I've been to. I've actually enjoyed them. I was saying to the guy, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4776.8s)]
*  Mike Tolan, I shared tickets with, I was like, I'm actually going to go to a bunch of quipper games. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4780.320000000001s)]
*  Like I like going, I had a good time. Uh, the vibe's good. It's just the thumbs up. So bomber, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4784.4800000000005s)]
*  like, I don't know how much, what did he spend? Like however many billion dollars, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4791.28s)]
*  it was fucking worth it. Cause he's not like the black sheep brother of the staple center anymore. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4796.320000000001s)]
*  You know, he actually has good NBA dates and there's a real vibe in the arena. So thumbs up. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4801.280000000001s)]
*  Great job Clippers. Yeah. You tuck them into it. I think, yeah, I'll watch these Kauai return games [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4807.04s)]
*  with, uh, with new found interest, maybe a dark horse in the West. That's great for the all positive [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4812.96s)]
*  NBA, uh, podcast. Yeah. A Kauai comeback to what it already exists. If he could be healthy, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4818.56s)]
*  it's just a really fun story. You know, like Kauai, uh, if you throw away the playoffs last year, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4826.96s)]
*  but before he got hurt beginning of last year, he looked like one of the 15 best guys in the league. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4832.72s)]
*  We've seen him in 2019. Isn't that long ago. I mean, put a team on his shoulders and got on there. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4838.96s)]
*  He's not that guy anymore, but he can win a playoff game. He can, he can play good defense, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4843.76s)]
*  get rebounds, make big shots and crunch time. James Harden can create shots. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4848.88s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, banking on, you have to be in an all positive podcast, Bill Simmons to bank on [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4853.04s)]
*  Kauai's long-term health and James Harden's, uh, postseason, uh, you really have to be in a positive [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4858.8s)]
*  environment to project them as a potential sleeper. I think Harden, the word in the street is he's, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4864.64s)]
*  he's matured with some of his off the court stuff is, is the word in the street. Who knows? Uh, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4872.0s)]
*  last thing just quickly is the all star arguments are going to be great for the all positive pod. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4879.679999999999s)]
*  We have just the guards of the West SGA, Harden, Anthony Edwards, Kyrie, Curry, Booker, Fox and Ja. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4885.28s)]
*  I'm positive all those guys can't make the team centers. Yokej, Wemby, Sabonis, Davis, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4894.0s)]
*  Shen Goon and Jaren Jackson on a really good Memphis team. Houston might not have an all star. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4899.04s)]
*  Houston might not have an all star. They're a two seed. Um, and then you go with the, uh, with the [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4904.96s)]
*  East, if Brunson and Mitchell and Kate, I'll make it. We still have to figure out Maxie, Dame, Trey, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4911.44s)]
*  Hero and Garland. We have to figure out how many calves, all stars there are. Um, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4916.56s)]
*  I just think there's a lot of good players. And when everybody starts doing their all star pods [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4923.2s)]
*  in two weeks, people are like, Holy shit, a lot of good players. And then we'll complain about the [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4927.92s)]
*  all star game, but we're not going to be all positive. It's going to be a Stephen Curry [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4933.52s)]
*  celebration weekend. Most people call it the all star weekend, but it's going to be Stephen Curry's [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4938.0s)]
*  convention. So he's definitely making it. I don't know what they'll have to do, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4943.280000000001s)]
*  but he's definitely in bill. There's no way that they're going to host it. Well, SGA, Harden, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4946.160000000001s)]
*  Harden has to make it. Yeah. Ant has to make it. I think Kyrie has to make it. And I think Curry [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4950.56s)]
*  has to make it. So that's five guards. And we haven't talked about Booker, Fox or Ja yet. Ja, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4956.320000000001s)]
*  you can maybe dig on some of the missed games, but, uh, but that's crazy that we're Booker and [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4960.64s)]
*  Fox aren't going to be in the all star game. I think that's where we're heading. So the league [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4966.0s)]
*  is loaded. That's it for the all positive NBA podcast, unless you had any, uh, last, last things [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4970.08s)]
*  that was good. I just, I just want to say to my beloved Texas Longhorns that are playing football [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4975.6s)]
*  tomorrow against Arizona state, uh, hook them horns. Let's see, let's see a win and get to the [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4980.240000000001s)]
*  semifinals. Listen, I I'm feeling positive about that. I'm feeling positive about everything in [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4984.32s)]
*  general. As we head to the end of, uh, end of 2025, what a positive ending. This is great. We didn't [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4990.96s)]
*  even talk about the Kings. I had a whole, I was going to make fun of the Kings. I'm not going to [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=4997.92s)]
*  do it because this is the all positive NBA podcast. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=5001.679999999999s)]
*  you [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMLl7CIKAg&t=5014.32s)]
