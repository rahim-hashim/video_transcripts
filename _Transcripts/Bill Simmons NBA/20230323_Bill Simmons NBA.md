# Do the Celtics Need to Take Better Care of Jaylen Brown? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22mwU-0xKjc)
*  So there's two things going on with him that concern me as a fan.
*  And I, you know, I'm a huge Jaylen Brown fan.
*  Um, but the KD trade rumors popped up last summer and the team never publicly
*  said we're not trading Jaylen Brown.
*  This is stupid.
*  Why is this out there?
*  And I was doing podcasts at the time saying they should come out and say, this
*  is bullshit.
*  We're not trading Jaylen Brown.
*  We want to build around Tatum and Jaylen.
*  But in the Celtics fan universe, it became a big debate.
*  Would you do this?
*  Wait, that's crazy.
*  You wouldn't trade Jaylen Brown for Kevin Durant.
*  He's one of the 15 best players of all time.
*  So that became a whole dialogue that I think he was really aware of.
*  And I don't think it was ever kind of shut down to his satisfaction.
*  So you had that piece and then you had the adoka piece who was somebody that I
*  think he really liked playing for.
*  And I think the lack of transparency about how that was handled, which I think
*  from an organizational standpoint, they couldn't really be that transparent
*  because I think there was some HR stuff and some legal stuff.
*  So the details were a little sparse even for the players.
*  But I think those two things together put this, this start of the season, even
*  though the Celtics were playing well, it just gave it a weird vibe.
*  And now, now that they're not playing well, it's starting to come out.
*  There was a New York times piece last week, an interview with him that he had,
*  he had some tough quotes about the city of Boston and the fans.
*  And then in this piece too, same thing.
*  It seems like he's struggling with his identity as a member of the Celtics and
*  whether, you know, the loyalty factors.
*  And then you go backwards with the history of the franchise, Ray Allen,
*  that's why he left.
*  They were going to trade him.
*  He found out they're going to trade him in 2012, ends up signing with Miami.
*  The way Isaiah Thomas was treated in 2017.
*  I think these guys are aware, like as great of an organization as this is, there
*  is that the moment we can turn you into a better asset, we might.
*  And it does, it might get affected them.
*  Well, there's a third thing to that bill, which is all of that stuff you talked
*  about going on in the summertime that goes on weeks after he led the, he helped
*  lead the Celtics to a, to a title, or not to a title, excuse me, to a finals run.
*  And he's thinking, Hey, I, I, this is the, this is the best team that we have had
*  in years, counting the times where we, the years where we had Kyrie, we got, I
*  got us to the help get us to the finals alongside Tatum and smart and Emma with
*  this guy.
*  And now you guys are talking about trading me on top of the fact that I was a
*  rookie when you guys did what you did to Isaiah Thomas.
*  Um, I remember seeing that firsthand.
*  I'm speaking in, uh, you know, for, for jailing in this and he's seeing this
*  world where, you know, I might not, I, I am a, I am a asset in, involved in the
*  institution rather than somebody that is a partner and trying to get us titles.
*  Um, and it's funny because it didn't really make the piece, but, uh, to your
*  point about the New York Times article and his relationship with Boston, it's
*  interesting because he already came when I talked to him, um, he had already come
*  in with the notion, um, of, uh, you know, just having just, just feeling weird about
*  going to Boston based on, based on all the things that he heard, um, just in
*  past baggage and things like that past baggage and things like that.
*  Um, so he was already getting that.
*  And I feel like his time in Boston has been just, it's been filled with
*  conflictions because, you know, first off, he thought that he should be a starter
*  right away and he did start in the beginning, but his time is playing time
*  with Dwindle, um, and you know, he's over here looking at, uh, Ben Simmons and
*  Philly, he's looking at, um, uh, uh, Ingram and he was in LA at that point, but he's
*  comparing himself to these other guys.
*  Like, I think I'm better than them.
*  Why am I not getting this opportunity?
*  And all of these things are happening on top of the fact that he's getting
*  dangled for when Anthony Davis is on the market, Hey, there's Jalen Brown.
*  He's a good asset.
*  Or when Kawhi Leonard is there, he's always, um, you know,
*  Paul George was another one.
*  Yeah.
*  They, he was in every, he was always the one that got thrown in a rumor,
*  whether it was true or untrue.
*  I think from his standpoint, especially with the KD thing, I think they made a
*  real mistake organizationally, not just coming out right away and being like,
*  Hey, we're not trading Jalen Brown.
*  We love Jalen Brown.
*  We want to build around him and Tatum.
*  Those are our guys.
*  And that's it.
*  Don't believe any stories about this, but they never said anything.
*  I thought, I don't know.
*  I didn't think it was well handled.
*  It was, I don't think it was either.
*  I mean, considering the fact that you at least publicly say you consider
*  him a, uh, a franchise star.
*  And I think, I really do think, um, this summer was a big, big turning point
*  because it was yet another time after he is a friend, after Jalen has become
*  this franchise corner, cornerstone, and then to be in trade rumors, because
*  it's one thing to be a young guy and be in trade rumors, cause that's just the
*  game, but when, after you lead a franchise to a, to a tie or to it, I
*  keep saying title every time, if you leave the franchise to the finals,
*  you expect to have some level of respect.
*  And you know, that Kevin Durant thing happened a week, a couple of
*  weeks after that finals appearance.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And he's thinking like another person you guys think is better than me.
*  On top of the other, other things that I, other conflictions I have with this
*  organization, so it's, it's, it's been a tough go for, for Jalen and, uh, you know,
*  it also to be fair and to be fair on that trade thing, we don't know if they
*  ever talked to the nets about an actual trade, but the problem is it was out
*  there that they were talking or they were circling and that's when you just
*  have to squash it and the fact that they didn't squash it in any way and just
*  let it kind of linger and then become a debate within the fan base and on the
*  media and on talk radio, that's where I think, I think they lost the
*  narrative a little bit.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And now it's, you know, this, this starting to come out as they try to
*  make another playoff run, you know, and this is just going to be, it's going to
*  be a tough thing overall for the Celtics and it's always something that tends to
*  happen with them.
*  Um, you know, say what you want about other organizations, but the Celtics are
*  getting a bit of a reputation that they don't take care of their stars, which is
*  something that the rest of the league sees.
*  Now they develop really, really well.
*  They, they draft really, really well.
*  But I think the next step for the Celtics and they have a newer regime.
*  This is not the Danny Aimes regime, but they have an opportunity or what they
*  should be doing is showing the rest of the league, nah, we take care of our
*  stars within the fabric of this organization.
*  And you know, they're kind of fumbling the ball on that, at least publicly.
*  Yeah, I would agree with that.
*  I mean, Danny left, I think Danny had the reputation.
*  It was always the joke of Danny would trade his mother if he could get five
*  more wins.
*  And that was just the mentality that nobody was safe at any time.
*  Um, but he hasn't been there for a year and a half.
*  And that's, that's what was so confusing to me as, as a Celtics fan and somebody
*  who's followed this franchise for a long time that, you know, Brown already had
*  enough baggage with the fact that Tatum was a little bit of the favorite son,
*  right?
*  Brown is a little bit of a middle child syndrome with Brown and it's always been
*  Tatum.
*  Tatum is the most popular guy in Boston.
*  He is.
*  Yeah.
*  He's the most popular athlete.
*  And once Brady left, Tatum really last year became the guy and Brown has been,
*  you know, his sidekick is the wrong word, but like his, his running mate.
*  But it was always Tatum.
*  I always compare it to a Tribe Called Quest.
*  Like it's Tatum is Q-Tip and, and Jalen Brown is Five Dog, right?
*  Like Five Dog is the one, like he, he can rap with anybody, but Q-Tip is always
*  the face in Tribe Called Quest.
*  And I really got that, that comparison when I, when I saw it, when I went out to
*  Boston, that I think Jalen is really, really respected.
*  And I think people really know what Jalen brings to the table, but you're right.
*  Jason is the one.
