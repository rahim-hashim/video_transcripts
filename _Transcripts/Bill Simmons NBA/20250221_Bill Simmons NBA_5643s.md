*  What store was that, Sean? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  I went to Waterloo Records. Shout out Waterloo. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  And I spent $184 on Blu-rays. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  We almost died on the way there and back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  It was fucking cold. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what is up, Austin? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=117.02s)]
*  So I was here for the Dallas Super Bowl in Texas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=119.02s)]
*  When was that, like 2010? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=121.02s)]
*  And it snowed like an inch [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=123.02s)]
*  and nobody could get anywhere [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=125.02s)]
*  because they had no snowplows. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=127.02s)]
*  And that was when I realized, oh yeah, Texas. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  Doesn't do well with cold weather. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  We are going to do a bunch of stuff with you guys today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  We have a big, fun, crazy draft [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  in the second part of this podcast. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  But we're going to start... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  We're going to do a hodgepodge thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  Let's start with All-Star Weekend [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  because it just happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=145.72s)]
*  Boom! [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=147.72s)]
*  Wow. Tough beat. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=149.72s)]
*  Second lowest ratings ever. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=151.72s)]
*  Shay, is this on cost? Can it be fixed? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=153.72s)]
*  It can be fixed. And I'm going to tell you how it's going to be fixed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=155.72s)]
*  There's a man. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=157.72s)]
*  A seven foot five man in San Antonio. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=159.72s)]
*  And he's going to save it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=165.72s)]
*  What's going to happen is, same thing that we saw [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=167.72s)]
*  happen with the end season tournament [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=169.72s)]
*  where LeBron said, hey guess what, I care about this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=171.72s)]
*  And then everybody else went, okay cool. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=174.42s)]
*  We care about it too. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=176.42s)]
*  That's going to happen with Wimby. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=178.42s)]
*  There's another seven foot five guy in San Antonio. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=180.42s)]
*  He's going to take it over. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=182.42s)]
*  I didn't know there was another one coming. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=184.42s)]
*  Right now, Joker is the guy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=186.42s)]
*  And he's like, I don't care about any of this at all. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=188.42s)]
*  I don't care one single percent. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=190.42s)]
*  So everybody else falls in line. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=192.42s)]
*  When Wimby's the guy, he's going to care. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=194.42s)]
*  And they're all going to care. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=196.42s)]
*  CR, what did you think of my idea that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=198.42s)]
*  we split the game up and the Sunday game [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=200.42s)]
*  and the guys from the top five seeds [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  and they play for home court advantage in the finals? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  I liked it to the extent, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  but it's really going to have to just convince these guys [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  to want to play more basketball and to play more hard basketball. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  I was thinking about this, I just think that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  this is probably entering the pro bowl zone [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  where you just got to move it to the end of the season [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=217.11999999999998s)]
*  after the season. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  You guys want to play, we'll have seven foot rims. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  You can do somersaults. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  You can get trampolines out there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  It could be like baseball. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  But I don't know about the mid season [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  after Luka gets traded, let's all stop, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=231.82s)]
*  go to this place [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=233.82s)]
*  and pretend like we care about this game. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=235.82s)]
*  Sean, do you, Van thought that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=237.82s)]
*  it might have culturally expired. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=239.82s)]
*  Which has happened a few times in our lifetime. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=241.82s)]
*  Specifically with some actors too. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=245.82s)]
*  Like who? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=247.82s)]
*  I don't know, who have culturally expired. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=249.82s)]
*  Like Kevin Spacey? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=251.82s)]
*  Well, that's the idea. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=253.82s)]
*  That was good. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=257.82s)]
*  Yes, I knew he'd come up. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=259.82s)]
*  I was in San Francisco this past weekend [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  and did I had tickets to the event [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  and did not go to any of the events, which is not a good sign. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, so I okay. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=269.42s)]
*  I call pitch my idea. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=272.12s)]
*  Let's here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=273.82s)]
*  I think they should scrap the game. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=274.62s)]
*  I think they should scrap the done contest. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  I think they should scrap the three point shooting contest. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=278.62s)]
*  That's everything scrap the futures game. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  What about the skills come? So I think that they should only [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=283.32s)]
*  do the skills competition, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=286.62s)]
*  but for two full days, I'm not kidding [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=288.62s)]
*  and make it like an insane double dare obstacle course. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=291.42s)]
*  Oh, but American gladiators, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=295.42s)]
*  grass, okay, but the winning team [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=297.42s)]
*  and I was inspired by Wemby and CP3 [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=300.62s)]
*  should automatically get home court advantage throughout the playoffs. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=302.62s)]
*  So there's like real stakes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=308.12s)]
*  So you'd have these guys like during practice during the season, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=310.82s)]
*  like really working on throwing the ball through that round circle [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=313.62s)]
*  or whatever and all the stuff that you there like the skills competition [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=316.22s)]
*  in like seven games in the regular season and they get the one seed. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=319.92s)]
*  Yes, I like that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=323.42s)]
*  Yeah, you could be like the playing team at number 10, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=324.22s)]
*  but you got a home court games that would work for the Sixers. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=326.42s)]
*  I for a number of years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=329.92s)]
*  I have told everybody that I met that Sean Finnesse is one of the smartest people [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  I've ever met in my life. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=335.22s)]
*  I changed my mind right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=336.02000000000004s)]
*  It's a horrible idea. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=337.62s)]
*  It's the worst idea I've ever heard. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=338.92s)]
*  No bad ideas in a brainstorm. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, the fact that we're coming up with ideas like this tells [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=343.62s)]
*  you how grim it is for all-star weekend. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=346.02s)]
*  I had an idea. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=348.32s)]
*  I wanted to bounce off you for this because I was thinking about because if you say Pro Bowl [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  and you're like make the NBA more like the NFL, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=352.32s)]
*  why doesn't the NBA do bi-weeks for teams but never take an all-star break? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=354.82s)]
*  It wasn't this like the all-star weekend always happens at a time where football is over. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=358.62s)]
*  You want basketball like you want important basketball games. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  Like why not just give the Bucks 10 days off, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=366.32s)]
*  but then bring them back and have it all work so that teams have bi-weeks throughout the season. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=369.02s)]
*  Isn't that what they're trying to do with Joel Embiid? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=373.82s)]
*  That was a Joel Embiid joke you guys didn't hear because of the mic. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=376.62s)]
*  But yeah, that is what they're trying to do with Joel Embiid. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  Shay, how would David Stern have handled the NBA in 2025? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=384.12s)]
*  I think about this a lot. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  It's like the angry grandparent you had that you were like, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  oh man, he would have been so mad. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=393.52s)]
*  I hate grandpa. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=395.12s)]
*  He's so annoying. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=395.82s)]
*  And then you kind of miss him. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=396.62s)]
*  Yeah, he would have cussed out everybody. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  It would have been some private meeting in a cafeteria [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=401.82s)]
*  and they all would have been sitting at cafeteria tables [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  and he'd just been like, guys, what the fuck is going on? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=406.52s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=409.12s)]
*  That's all that would have happened. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=409.82s)]
*  Do you miss Stern fantasy? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=411.82s)]
*  I miss the idea of the power that he represented. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=414.42s)]
*  I also love the idea of him like firing Nico Harrison. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=418.32s)]
*  You know, like he would have just done that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=422.32s)]
*  This guy is out of the paint. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=424.12s)]
*  And he would have done something like that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=427.42s)]
*  So I miss that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=428.92s)]
*  Do people in Austin, so do you lean toward the Spurs? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=431.72s)]
*  Or like what's the... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=435.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  So when the Mavericks... [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  So you guys are just Luka fans. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=442.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=443.92s)]
*  So when the Mavericks traded Luka, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=444.62s)]
*  you guys are just laughing your asses off? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=446.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=449.92s)]
*  What was your reaction, Shay? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=450.72s)]
*  That was the first time I ever felt bad for Dallas Mavericks fans. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=452.42s)]
*  Like I've laughed at every single horrible thing that has ever happened. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=456.32000000000005s)]
*  When they lost to the Warriors, the We Believe Warriors number one seed, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=459.32s)]
*  belly laughed at them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=463.82s)]
*  When they had their championship stolen by the Miami Heat in 2006, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=465.62s)]
*  belly laughed at them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=469.92s)]
*  And then when I saw this, I felt like sadness, genuine sadness. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=471.92s)]
*  Because you're a man of the people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=475.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=476.42s)]
*  Like what... [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=476.92s)]
*  2011. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=477.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=478.42s)]
*  2011. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=478.92s)]
*  What was your reaction when you heard the trade CR? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=481.62s)]
*  I never had you... [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=484.82s)]
*  Is Dirk here? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=485.62s)]
*  Only people I didn't have on a podcast. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=486.32s)]
*  Was me. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=488.42s)]
*  My reaction was I was coming out of the movie Companion. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=490.12s)]
*  And I was just like utterly shocked. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=494.52000000000004s)]
*  Couldn't believe it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=497.72s)]
*  My favorite thing about it since it's happened is definitely that the Mavericks [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  keep finding executives to do profiles where they're like, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=503.22s)]
*  I underestimated the crowd reaction to this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=507.02000000000004s)]
*  Like Rick Welts just did one. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=509.12s)]
*  I was like, Rick Welts works for the Mavericks? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=510.92s)]
*  And they're just pushing these guys out on the ice flow to get shot with arrows. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  Like every other day. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=517.82s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=519.32s)]
*  Nico's doing a good job getting other people involved. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=519.82s)]
*  Have you been... [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=524.0200000000001s)]
*  I know you're a student of journalism, Sean. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=524.72s)]
*  Have you been following some of these features with the Mavs? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=526.32s)]
*  Have they been trying to... [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=528.72s)]
*  We weren't actually going to give Luca the max extension. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=530.5200000000001s)]
*  People didn't realize because we're idiots. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=533.0200000000001s)]
*  So we weren't going to do that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=536.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=537.22s)]
*  I think that they shouldn't talk, which is not good for journalism, obviously. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=538.0200000000001s)]
*  I think that everyone should be held accountable for their actions. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=543.82s)]
*  I did have an idea for ownership groups though, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=546.62s)]
*  which is I think if you're going to buy a team, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=548.72s)]
*  you should have to pass like an NBA literacy test. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=551.12s)]
*  Like when you become an American citizen, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=553.82s)]
*  you have to learn about like who wrote the Declaration of Independence. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=555.52s)]
*  You should have to know the history of the game. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=559.12s)]
*  So Patrick Dumont? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=561.12s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to name any names. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=562.12s)]
*  Just be like, what year did the NBA and NBA merge? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=564.22s)]
*  And he's like, 1988? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=567.02s)]
*  I kind of like having crazy owners back though. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=570.32s)]
*  Don't you? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=573.72s)]
*  Well, I like the fact that we always seem to have six to eight terrible run teams. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=574.52s)]
*  That's great for us for content. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=582.02s)]
*  But the real thing that's interesting is the Lakers are villainous again. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=583.52s)]
*  Because they pull off this trade. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=587.62s)]
*  And then they trade for Mark Williams. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=589.72s)]
*  And then they just void the trade. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=593.22s)]
*  They're like, we don't like... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=594.92s)]
*  This hasn't happened in like two decades. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=595.8199999999999s)]
*  And Mark Williams is like, I'm healthy. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=597.52s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=599.12s)]
*  They're like, no, actually, no thanks. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=600.52s)]
*  And then the trade deadline passed. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=603.42s)]
*  Charlotte couldn't trade him. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=604.92s)]
*  But like if somebody did this in your fantasy league, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=606.42s)]
*  it would be the angriest chain of emails ever. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=609.2199999999999s)]
*  And people would stop talking. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=613.02s)]
*  And it's like, Bob's not invited to Gary's wedding now. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=614.62s)]
*  Yeah, oh, it's because of Mark Williams trade. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=618.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=619.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happened. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=620.62s)]
*  They seriously, they haven't void their trade in 15 years yet. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=623.42s)]
*  And apparently when you make a trade, you send the team to fit the medicals. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=627.12s)]
*  And they can look at them. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  So I think they just said, fuck it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=632.92s)]
*  We don't want this guy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=634.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's all that it was. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=635.92s)]
*  I swear to God, if the Lakers get some crazy deal for a center over the summer [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=637.12s)]
*  that they were like saving the spot for or the trade assets for, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=640.52s)]
*  I'm going to lose it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=644.92s)]
*  Are you guys on my side that more people knew about this trade [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=646.02s)]
*  than everyone's letting on? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=650.42s)]
*  Because I think like a lot of people knew. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=651.92s)]
*  And then they're all like, we didn't know. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=653.62s)]
*  Found out last second. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=655.3199999999999s)]
*  So when Rich Paul was like, I had no idea. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  I found out a few minutes... [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=658.52s)]
*  No offense to him. I don't believe it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=660.2199999999999s)]
*  I think both coaches knew. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=661.72s)]
*  I think Anthony Davis knew. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=663.32s)]
*  I think the agent knew. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=665.4200000000001s)]
*  Like he had to waive the no trade clause. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=666.52s)]
*  I'm just never going to believe it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=668.12s)]
*  They're never going to convince me. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=669.22s)]
*  I think LeBron knew. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=671.22s)]
*  What about, but Luca had no idea. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=672.12s)]
*  I think Luca was the only one that didn't know. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  Luca was like, I just got an awesome $15 million house in the greater Dallas area. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=677.22s)]
*  The Mavericks were like, yeah, he didn't know because he was out there getting fucking drunk [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=682.12s)]
*  and eating like fried chicken. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=686.62s)]
*  Crazy motherfucker. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=689.12s)]
*  He was like, binging Netflix. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=691.72s)]
*  So Shay, the Luca Donchich movie, when they make it, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=693.92s)]
*  is it a TV movie, like a Ryan Murphy type of movie? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=698.82s)]
*  Is it a sports movie? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=702.02s)]
*  Is it a dark, seedy drama that Sean would really like [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=704.42s)]
*  and do multiple big picture episodes of? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=707.62s)]
*  Or is it a heist movie? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=709.22s)]
*  It's like Margin Call. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=710.32s)]
*  Margin Call. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=711.92s)]
*  Just a bunch of late night whatever is happening in a whatever. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=714.92s)]
*  That's all that it is. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=718.42s)]
*  You like that. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=719.42s)]
*  Would you want to walk through the heist movie with Luca Donchich with Polinka's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=719.92s)]
*  Neil McCauley? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=723.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=724.42s)]
*  Well, he kind of dresses like Neil McCauley a little bit. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=724.92s)]
*  Maybe a slightly tighter slack. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=727.3199999999999s)]
*  I think he has a condo with no furniture in it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=728.7199999999999s)]
*  Genie's never let him feel comfortable without some high furniture. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=732.92s)]
*  I do like the idea of it being a Ryan Murphy FX series, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=736.12s)]
*  but I would want the same cast as the Aaron Hernandez show. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=738.8199999999999s)]
*  Like just put them in. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=743.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't know about Leo but to play Patrick Dumont, you know, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=746.72s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=751.52s)]
*  Fantasy? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=751.92s)]
*  I think this is the chance to finally get Oliver Stone back where he belongs. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=752.82s)]
*  Oh, oh yeah, and I think that we have yet to see the way we can conspiracy [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=756.92s)]
*  theorize about what's happened here, but I think he should do it entirely in [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=763.12s)]
*  the register of the doors where it's just like Nico Harrison is just tripping [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=766.02s)]
*  on LSD the whole time. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=770.52s)]
*  He like micro doses every morning. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=772.42s)]
*  He's like, yeah, Lucas should go like just losing his mind. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=774.12s)]
*  But if they do it of American guy in the desert, it would be great if they [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=777.42s)]
*  do it like JFK. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=781.42s)]
*  That means you get to play Donald Sutherland who benefited. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=782.22s)]
*  What you're laying out though, because then Cuban maybe Cubans like because [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=788.82s)]
*  he's better that he sold the team. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=792.92s)]
*  So he wants them to destroy the team and he's like he's like drugging [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=794.92s)]
*  Nico Harrison. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=798.32s)]
*  Yeah, this is like it's getting dark. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=799.12s)]
*  It's like traffic. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=800.82s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=802.82s)]
*  Kevin Durant you guys like Kevin Durant, right? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=805.02s)]
*  He loves Austin Katie's a little bit of a Nomad, you know, starts out in [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=809.92s)]
*  OKC nine years there goes to Golden State goes to Brooklyn goes to Phoenix [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=814.22s)]
*  almost gets trade in the Deadline. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=818.22s)]
*  And yet I think we all like him. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=820.42s)]
*  I always feel like I'm like a Katie defender. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=822.02s)]
*  You saw the clip this week with from the new Netflix series about the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=824.22s)]
*  Olympics and Katie just starts crying. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=828.42s)]
*  He loves basketball so much. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=831.32s)]
*  Like I really think he's one of the most genuine athletes that we have [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=832.82s)]
*  but also takes a ton of shit. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=837.32s)]
*  Shay, what do you want his next five years to look like? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=839.52s)]
*  I would if you could direct his next five years. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=843.72s)]
*  What would it be? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=846.4200000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't mind him spending two years in San Antonio. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=846.82s)]
*  That would be pretty great. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=849.02s)]
*  Maybe the two last prime years, right? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=851.32s)]
*  Like not in the last two last two good years and then the last three [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=853.32s)]
*  years they bring the Sonics back. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=857.02s)]
*  It's time for the league to expand and then he goes back there. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=858.72s)]
*  I think that would be really cool. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=861.92s)]
*  So two years like Wembe's first. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  I can't believe he's in the finals this young. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=866.52s)]
*  Yeah, and he's part of that with Dan Fox. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=868.7199999999999s)]
*  I like that. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=872.02s)]
*  What do you think shot? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=872.42s)]
*  I think he should make a sequel to the Disney original film Thunderstruck [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=873.7199999999999s)]
*  Thunderstruck 2. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=877.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Phoenix Rising. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=879.02s)]
*  Keep following that story a little bit. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=881.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, he messed up. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=884.52s)]
*  He should have signed with the New York Knicks, but he was a coward. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=885.42s)]
*  So screw him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=887.8199999999999s)]
*  I actually you lost the crowd 30 degrees outside. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=889.7199999999999s)]
*  We can't intact. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=894.92s)]
*  I love you, Texas. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=897.3199999999999s)]
*  I actually think even KD would admit nets over next was a mistake. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=898.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like him to go to Boston and then. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=902.52s)]
*  Or just straight. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=909.62s)]
*  I don't like this trade for Kyrie Irving to come back to Boston with him [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=910.52s)]
*  and then maybe orchestrate a trade for James Harden to come back. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=916.12s)]
*  He's Tatum and Brown for Katie. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=920.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=922.2199999999999s)]
*  I think the San Antonio thing would be great because he Katie really does [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=924.02s)]
*  have genuine affection for University of Texas, even though he was only here [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=928.02s)]
*  one year, but the way he talks about it would be cool. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, our drive back and forth. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=935.02s)]
*  He would be instantly beloved in San Antonio, which is what he needs. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=937.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he does because you don't want to be the guy who played for 25 years [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=941.42s)]
*  and everyone's like, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=945.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, got a retirement ceremony and it's like you played for the nets [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=946.62s)]
*  for four years, the retirement. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=950.92s)]
*  Like a 15 minute honorarium to him during the dunk contest or something. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=952.42s)]
*  Yeah, that was weird. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=956.02s)]
*  Yeah, really feels like he's still alive. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=957.22s)]
*  Then he came out. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=962.02s)]
*  It was like, I thought he was that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=963.22s)]
*  Vin Carter's at SNL 50 like, it's all right. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=965.22s)]
*  I think he's like, I'm going to go to the next one. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=970.02s)]
*  I'm going to go to the next one. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=972.12s)]
*  I'm going to go to the next one. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=973.22s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=974.12s)]
*  It feels like there's a lot of rehabilitation stuff with retired stars [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=976.72s)]
*  whose careers didn't turn out perfectly. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=981.32s)]
*  Like Carmelo is another one and then Dwight Howard's like, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=984.42s)]
*  I'd like to figure out how to do this, but I'm too much of a mess. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=986.92s)]
*  I can't. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=990.72s)]
*  But in general, it's funny how like we hear way more about Carmelo [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=992.72s)]
*  and way more about Vince Carter now than Tim Duncan, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=997.32s)]
*  who's one of the best seven players of all time. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=999.82s)]
*  But it's kind of in one way, it's Tim Duncan's fault [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1001.92s)]
*  because he doesn't do like the post-career. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1005.42s)]
*  Look at me. Look at me. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1008.12s)]
*  Remember, like he just doesn't. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1009.12s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1010.62s)]
*  But now nobody talks about him. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that's by design, though. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  There's nothing he wants less than to be part of a conversation. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1015.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1018.42s)]
*  So he's doing great. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1020.92s)]
*  He came in, won five titles, got the fuck out. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1021.8199999999999s)]
*  Is he coaching? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1025.42s)]
*  He's coaching now, right? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1026.92s)]
*  Yeah, he might pop in and coach a little bit. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1027.92s)]
*  But that's the point that we're making. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1030.12s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1031.82s)]
*  He's like John Wick. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1032.32s)]

*  to eliminate shows like this. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=1109.62s)]

*  10 for 10. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3354.92s)]
*  I thought he was just taking like 17 footers. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3355.92s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3357.92s)]
*  Go back and watch the tape, man. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3358.92s)]
*  Come on. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3359.92s)]
*  We studied it. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3360.92s)]
*  Get money from the top of the key. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3361.92s)]
*  So I've shot from, I like that. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3363.92s)]
*  That's a really good pick. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3365.92s)]
*  And he goes in with your team of quitters. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3366.92s)]
*  Quit. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3369.92s)]
*  Shep quit. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3371.92s)]
*  Neon tried to quit. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3373.92s)]
*  Billy will try to quit his relationship. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3375.92s)]
*  You're up, Sean. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3377.92s)]
*  I'm going to take some, a more recent vintage of player and the most recent great basketball movie hustle starring Adam Sandler. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3378.92s)]
*  Oh, I like that. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3387.92s)]
*  Oh, I like this. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3388.92s)]
*  And I'll take Bo Cruz portrayed by one show. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3389.92s)]
*  Hernan Gomez is on the board. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3392.92s)]
*  Great pick one show. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3394.92s)]
*  Need a big man. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3395.92s)]
*  Obviously a bit of an unknown coming overseas really needed a strong voice and advocate for his game. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3396.92s)]
*  And frankly, we need his size on our squad. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3402.92s)]
*  His size unselfish. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3404.92s)]
*  Yes, I thought you were going to go Edwards there. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3406.92s)]
*  Shit. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3408.92s)]
*  She has two picks. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3409.92s)]
*  I got to Jimmy Chitwood. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3410.92s)]
*  Great pick. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3413.92s)]
*  Very clutch. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3414.92s)]
*  There's only been one player ever in fictional basketball who was more clutch than Jimmy and that's Snake Plissken from Escape from L.A. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3415.92s)]
*  He's in the full court torture chamber of death. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3425.92s)]
*  He's got to hit five shots before the 10 second clock. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3428.92s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3433.92s)]
*  It ends with him throwing in the second. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3434.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3436.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3437.92s)]
*  Throwing a full course shot. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3438.92s)]
*  The first. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3439.92s)]
*  Let me explain what happens. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3440.92s)]
*  The start of the beginning of escape. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3442.92s)]
*  They have a basketball court with guys with guns all around it. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3444.92s)]
*  They've captured Snake. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3448.92s)]
*  They have him in the basketball court. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3449.92s)]
*  The guy in charge, some whatever bad guy, tells him, hey, you got to score 10 points. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3451.92s)]
*  I'm going to put 10 seconds on the shot clock. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3456.92s)]
*  You get the ball to half court. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3458.92s)]
*  Every time you score, the clock resets itself. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3459.92s)]
*  And if you don't score 10 points before the clock resets itself or if you miss a shot, we're going to shoot you and you're going to die. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3462.92s)]
*  So the first one, he makes a layup. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3469.92s)]
*  Easy. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3471.92s)]
*  But he bobbles it a little bit so he doesn't get all the way down. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3472.92s)]
*  So the second shot he has to shoot like a 15 footer. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3474.92s)]
*  Now he's got to shoot a three pointer. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3477.92s)]
*  And then his last two shots he has to shoot from half court. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3478.92s)]
*  Fucking drills it. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3480.92s)]
*  And then full court with his life on the line. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3481.92s)]
*  With one eye. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3485.92s)]
*  He's got one eye. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3487.92s)]
*  And he fucking drills it. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3489.92s)]
*  It's as clutch as it gets. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3492.92s)]
*  What do you think of Kurt Russell's shooting form? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3494.92s)]
*  He's 100% from the field. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3497.92s)]
*  I don't care what it looks like. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3498.92s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3500.92s)]
*  Fucking Sean Marion that bitch up there. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3501.92s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3503.92s)]
*  Let that thing go. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3504.92s)]
*  He's so cool. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3506.92s)]
*  He's such a cool guy. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3507.92s)]
*  Such a cool guy. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3509.92s)]
*  He came by my podcast once. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3510.92s)]
*  And he came by himself. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3512.92s)]
*  It was 10 in the morning. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3514.92s)]
*  He was wearing a leather jacket. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3515.92s)]
*  It was 78 degrees outside. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3516.92s)]
*  And he stunk of cigarettes. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3518.92s)]
*  And I was just like, you're fucking awesome. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3519.92s)]
*  From you. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3521.92s)]
*  Sean, you're up. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3525.92s)]
*  Wait, I got one more. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3526.92s)]
*  Oh, you were up. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3527.92s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3528.92s)]
*  My last pick. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3529.92s)]
*  I need a wild card. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3530.92s)]
*  I need a guy who's going to do something nobody else is going to do. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3531.92s)]
*  Give me David from Prometheus, the android. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3534.92s)]
*  You fucking stole that from me, man. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3537.92s)]
*  Yeah, see? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3540.92s)]
*  There's one scene where he's playing basketball. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3541.92s)]
*  He's riding a bicycle and shooting. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3544.92s)]
*  He's shooting three hook shots. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3547.92s)]
*  On the bike, drilling it. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3549.92s)]
*  And you know what the best thing about David is? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3552.92s)]
*  You don't have to worry about load management. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3553.92s)]
*  You don't have to worry about load management. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3555.92s)]
*  He's an android. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3557.92s)]
*  And then the head cut off comes back to work the next day. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3558.92s)]
*  This is an unbeatable team. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3560.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3561.92s)]
*  So is that a forward or a guard? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3562.92s)]
*  That's a guard. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3565.92s)]
*  That's a guard. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3566.92s)]
*  That's my shooting guard. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3567.92s)]
*  Android guy? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3569.92s)]

*  What do you got, Sean? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3582.92s)]
*  I've got an incredibly flexible roster, but I need an owner. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3587.92s)]
*  My man is stressed. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3590.92s)]
*  Somebody who I can really trust. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3591.92s)]
*  Somebody who's got big ideas, who knows how to continue building out a front office. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3593.92s)]
*  No Nikos in this business. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3598.92s)]
*  So I'm going Joe Cabot from Reservoir Dogs. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3600.92s)]
*  You know, we know how he knows how to put a job together. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3605.92s)]

*  What's that? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3611.92s)]
*  Is he owner or GM? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3612.92s)]
*  He's owner. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3613.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3614.92s)]
*  And he also loves his Nepal baby son, gave him a job in the front office, which is very [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3615.92s)]
*  owner behavior. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3622.92s)]

*  For not enough balls for that team. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3642.92s)]
*  I think I need a glue guy. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3645.92s)]
*  I need a deep bench guy who's going to keep everybody loose. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3647.92s)]
*  So I'm going to go with Jim Carroll from Basketball Diaries played by Leonardo DiCaprio. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3650.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3655.92s)]
*  I love the idea of him getting Jimmy Chitwood into heroin. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3656.92s)]
*  of him getting Jimmy Chitwood into heroin. You know, just to mix it up. Six [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3659.92s)]
*  man dead deep bench. Another white guy. I know I'm sorry about that by accident. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3668.32s)]
*  This is the I this is that everybody. I was going to draft David. That's right. I [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3679.44s)]
*  feel somehow emboldened. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3684.52s)]
*  I have two picks. It's a big part of the draft for me. I need a guard. Right now I [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3689.92s)]
*  have number 45 from Teen Wolf at Center. Moses Guthrie, Hustler, and Neil McCauley is my [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3699.84s)]
*  GM. And I'm going to take Butch McCray from Blue Chips. Keeping my philosophy of real [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3705.28s)]
*  life basketball players playing characters. This is Penny Hardaway. He had not ended up [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3712.16s)]
*  on Orlando yet. And I just want to tell you, because this was over 30 years ago, them [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3716.96s)]
*  drafting Penny Hardaway to play with Shaq, but they were both in a movie together. Might [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3721.84s)]
*  have been the single coolest thing in 1993. I think that's why they hit all my interest [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3727.44s)]
*  points at the same time. Yeah. Anyway, so we'll take him. And then I can't believe he's still [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3732.8s)]
*  on the board. I think I'm going to use him as a as my bench guy. But Fletch during the [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3739.6s)]
*  dream sequence. Fletch with the Afro. You know, it's not a long scene, but you can see [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3745.44s)]
*  there's a lot going on there. He's just a force. The other team didn't know what was [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3754.16s)]
*  happening. So Fletch with the Afro is my bench guy. What do you got, CR? I'll take Tupac from [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3759.76s)]
*  Above the Rim as my coach. Oh, Birdie. Yeah. Birdie. Interesting motivational techniques, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3767.6s)]
*  communication style. And I just think that this is a team of guys like you've mentioned, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3773.68s)]
*  quitters, and perhaps Tupac will motivate them to do otherwise. A little razor blade. Yeah. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3778.08s)]
*  Trying to balance out all that white. That's right. So I have to, do I know now Sean's up? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3786.56s)]
*  Now Sean's got? Yeah. A lot of guys left. Yeah, I'm going to take, I'm going to, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3795.36s)]
*  I'm going to slide Shuttlesworth to the three. Okay. And I'm going to take Uncle Drew in the [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3802.32s)]
*  cinematic masterpiece of Uncle Drew. Sorry, Kyrie Irving, which is the film I've not seen. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3808.7200000000003s)]
*  But I have seen that commercial and that old man can ball out. So that's, he'll be bringing it up [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3817.36s)]
*  for us. Right. So you're going a little smaller. Yeah. Trying to counter all that. All the white [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3825.6000000000004s)]
*  guys. Shay, you got two. I got two for my six man and my deep bench. Six man, not a six man at all. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3830.64s)]
*  He's a six dog. Give me air bud. A champion. The greatest winner in sports movie history. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3837.8399999999997s)]

*  Championship in soccer. Baseball. Fucking played baseball and won a championship. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3855.52s)]
*  That kid is a winner. Give me air bud. It's a movie that only makes sense when you have a kid. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3861.12s)]
*  Yeah. Cause it came out, I was like, this is the stupidest thing ever. And then you have like a [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3868.8s)]
*  five year old and they're like, what is it? It's like Gone With The Wind. The greatest cinematic [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3873.92s)]
*  achievement anyone's made. A dog scoring baskets. Anyway. Gone With The Wind is a weirdly popular [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3880.96s)]
*  movie in my locker room actually. Yeah. Billion shit, which is like, I love this part. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3886.7200000000003s)]
*  For my deep bench. Wait, are we allowed to pick TV as well or is it only movies? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3903.28s)]
*  No movies. Don't try to cheat. You already took the bedazzled guy. You have a dog on your team [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3907.52s)]
*  for Christ's sake. I was going to grab Jim from the office because he was a fucking monster. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3913.04s)]
*  But if I can't have him, then I need a deep bench person. Give me Spaceman from Sunset Park. Does [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3918.7200000000003s)]
*  anybody remember? Yeah. A young Terrence Howard. Yeah. Right? Rhea Perlman is coaching this inner [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3925.36s)]
*  city team. They're getting beat real bad in a game. She's yelling at him at halftime and he plays [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3931.44s)]
*  the crazy kid on the team that nobody talks to. And she's screaming at him and she's like, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3937.52s)]
*  is there anybody in here who's not afraid to play this other team? And then they all look at him [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3941.2000000000003s)]
*  and then they just go, no, no, no, no, no. And then it cuts to him diving after loose balls [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3946.48s)]
*  and taking charges and crashing into people and smiling. And it's just great. It's a great [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3951.12s)]
*  moment. I need a guy coming off the bench running into people. Give me Spaceman. I just want to say, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3955.68s)]
*  we've known each other a long time and you had seven player spots. You not taking Timo Cruz from [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3961.04s)]
*  Coach Carter is the most shocking moment of my year so far. I don't need him. I don't need him. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3967.44s)]
*  I just can't believe it. He can't do anything better than the guys on my team. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3972.56s)]
*  Can't do it. I tell you what, Coach Carter would not have sent bedazzled home. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3977.44s)]
*  I tell you that. I tell you that. Sean, what do you got? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3984.32s)]
*  That [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3988.56s)]
*  tough one got Uncle Drew, lock that down. Jesus shuttles worth Sydney Dean. We're closing out [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3992.96s)]
*  the blue chips, triumvirate. I need a, I need to stretch for so I'm going with Ricky Roe, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=3999.36s)]
*  the real pride of Indiana, who is the horniest, greediest dickhead in the history of basketball [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4006.24s)]
*  movies, but who has an incredible stroke as portrayed by Matt Nover. And I'm referring, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4012.7999999999997s)]
*  of course, to his bed game. Yeah, why are you staring right at me? You're saying [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4017.44s)]
*  what I think Ricky Roe, I think C R and so we're going to be playing seven seconds or less Phoenix [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4024.08s)]
*  on style. That's what I'm thinking. I like it. C R [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4031.52s)]
*  C R. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4035.44s)]
*  Would that go over well if I did that? Let's think about it for a second. I'm for my owner. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4045.44s)]
*  I've been thinking about this a lot from a heist film. I'm going to go with Christo from the Town [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4050.32s)]
*  played by Blake Lively. I just think Blake Lively in the owner's box is box office. That's just [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4056.8s)]
*  absolutely amazing content. And do I get a second pick here? Or is just one? Okay. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4063.84s)]
*  I have no idea what the order is. Okay. I'll take Blake Lively as my owner. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4070.56s)]
*  So you're taking Christo from the town. Yes. Yes. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4075.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4080.08s)]
*  And who's, who's, who's shines dead? I think it's supposed to be the implication is it might be [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4089.7599999999998s)]
*  Doug, right? But I, it's going to be Rosilla. Yeah. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4095.52s)]
*  I can't believe somebody threw out the Ed Norton. My scouts did look at it. The two-hand dunk. His [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4103.2s)]
*  real name was Derek Vineyard. I'm not taking him. Team chemistry was too risky. Yeah. Just [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4108.88s)]
*  didn't seem like a great move. When I got to Austin, I went to Kirk's house. I was hanging [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4114.64s)]
*  out with Kirk and he was trying to convince me to take Derek. He was like the advanced analytics, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4118.96s)]
*  say you should take the not. He was unbelievable. He's like, it's worth the risk. It's worth the [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4122.56s)]
*  risk. I don't think it is. That's what guys were saying. And he didn't show me. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4126.400000000001s)]
*  Kirk's showing you your shot chart. His shots are in the shape of a swastika. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4134.4800000000005s)]
*  I could not make that joke. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4152.0s)]
*  I'm taking as my owner, Danny Ocean. There you go. Interesting. There you go. Handsome. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4154.24s)]
*  Good as job. Yeah. He'll represent us well. I think the fans will like him and he's got a Rob [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4165.04s)]
*  Polinka. He kind of vibe to him. Could see him talking Nico Harrison and giving away the farm. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4171.36s)]
*  I have some questions about Neil reporting to Danny. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4176.799999999999s)]
*  That's one of the reasons we have Danny. Yeah. Yeah. And then for one of my assistant coaches, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4180.16s)]
*  I'm just going to lock him down. Also from Heat. Michael Choretto played by Tom Sizemore. I just [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4190.16s)]
*  feel like you need him every once in a while for that. For me, he's a great guy. He's a great guy. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4202.5599999999995s)]
*  For me, the action is the juice. You just need him in the room for the big moments. So he's on [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4209.4400000000005s)]
*  there too. I got him. Sorry, CR. That's okay. Just one pick or two picks now? You get five picks. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4215.04s)]
*  You always have one pick. All right. For my assistant coach, I'm going to do Rusty from [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4223.52s)]
*  Ocean's 11. Just absolute. When the coach yells at you, when Tupac's done yelling at them, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4230.320000000001s)]
*  Rusty will just be like, sorry guys, don't worry about it. Like he, he's not really going to kill [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4236.4800000000005s)]
*  you after the game. You're like, so yeah, I'll go with Rusty for assistant coach. I like it. Sean, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4240.72s)]
*  for my coach, I'll be taking Jack Cunningham from the way back because we know that Jack knows how [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4247.360000000001s)]
*  to, how to fight the good fight and inspire. And I, we need to find a way to beat seven foot six [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4253.120000000001s)]
*  Brendan Fraser somehow. So I feel like he could draw up some interesting plays for our seven [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4260.96s)]
*  seconds or less. How do you see Jack working with Sandy Lyle on your team? Well, I see some [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4265.84s)]
*  potential issues, but I'm excited to see what Jack can pull together. All right, Shay, you got to. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4272.4800000000005s)]
*  Alrighty. I need a coach. Yeah, you sure do. And I need a coach who can handle a devil wish man, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4279.04s)]
*  a guy with an Uzi, a point guard with blood lust, an Android and a one-eyed mercenary. Yeah. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4286.72s)]
*  And there's only one guy we've seen in any movie who could, I think, handle that lineup. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4294.08s)]
*  That's coach Finstock from Teen Wolf. Yeah. He's just sitting on a bench. One of his players turns [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4299.44s)]
*  into a werewolf and he looks and he's like, fuck it. Ball up top, baby. That's right. That's who I [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4305.84s)]
*  need coaching my team. So give me him. You know, just as an aside on coach, because he was on my [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4317.280000000001s)]
*  board. He was the one who had the three rules. Yeah. Always get 12 hours of sleep, never play [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4324.4800000000005s)]
*  cards with a guy who's got the first name as a city and never go near a lady who has a dagger [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4331.04s)]
*  on her body. You stick with that and everything else is cream cheese. That was coach Finstock. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4337.12s)]
*  An absolute legend. He was on my board. We're winning a championship. For my owner, I'm going [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4344.96s)]
*  to go the sort of same strategy you went. I need a guy who pulled off the perfect heist. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4351.68s)]
*  Give me Dalton Russell from inside man. That's all I need. Nobody dies. He walks away a hero [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4357.28s)]
*  and very rich. Give me that guy. I want him running my stuff. All right, Sean, we're running out of [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4363.44s)]
*  spots. You have two assistant spots, a GM spot. I know that's Shay. I have a GM spot still. Yeah, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4369.28s)]
*  you have a GM spot still. Yeah. And I'm going to, I'm going double Affleck. I'm going Tom Redfly [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4376.719999999999s)]
*  Davis from Triple Frontier, so we'll be reporting to Affleck [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4381.04s)]
*  never before seen doubling in a basketball characters, movie draft, great idea and Redfly. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4387.2s)]
*  Of course, fails miserably at the end of Triple Frontier killed. Nevertheless, I trust him to [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4395.28s)]
*  run this franchise effectively to a championship. That is, can I ask the crowd? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4400.88s)]
*  Where do you guys stand on Triple Frontier? Yeah, see, that's why it's on the list. Yeah, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4405.52s)]

*  I'm back around. Sean Finnessy is the smartest person I've ever met. I'm back. I'm back. That's [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4416.0s)]
*  great. CR, do you think you have one pick or two right now? I think I have one. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=4420.88s)]

*  break. Is there basketball and Bodi in point break? No, it's a high smoothie bro. Okay, yeah. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5131.6s)]
*  You're super spun around tonight, Chris Chris's first draft everybody [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5143.92s)]
*  right. Bodi rules. You know, does he live to tell the tale of his own success? I maybe not, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5148.72s)]
*  but that's not really what we're thinking about when we've also got Danny Sharp from ambulance [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5157.12s)]
*  coaching our team and Jack Cunningham, who obviously has a long history of substance abuse. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5161.04s)]
*  So we're just this is one last season for us. We're just trying to go out in a blaze of glory, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5166.16s)]
*  and I'm really excited about it. A long term project that trying to build anything here, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5171.68s)]
*  but Joe Cabot, we saw what happened to the last team he had. They all shot each other, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5175.92s)]
*  so this could be complicated. Shea, you have the last pick and it's an assistant coach, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5180.24s)]
*  and then I'm going to read everyone on the teams and the crowd can decide all right. Well, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5185.36s)]
*  you know what I'm a sucker for a magic trick. I want a guy around who could do magic. Give me [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5189.4400000000005s)]
*  Jesse Eisenberg's character, J Daniel Atlas from now. You see me high pressure situation [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5194.56s)]
*  wearing the playoffs and he's like, Hey, check this out. Some sleight of hand magic in the [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5200.56s)]
*  finals. What movie was that? Now you see me. I don't like the face that you made. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5205.76s)]
*  When I said that it's a good movie. Yeah. A lot to watch today, Bill. Now you see me ambulance. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5214.080000000001s)]
*  Now you see me was a movie that came out in the theater. Yeah. Yeah. I made like [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5220.400000000001s)]
*  $300 million. It's a good movie. Is that not on the list for you? Now you see me. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5224.64s)]
*  So people who didn't get taken. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5229.92s)]
*  Junior from coach Carter did not get taken. The guy from the air up there did not get taken. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5234.48s)]
*  Sala. Flatch from Hoosiers who all he did was go through a trophy case, put a bandage on it and [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5239.92s)]
*  keep going. Trying to rebound. He didn't go. We mentioned American history X guy. Yeah. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5246.24s)]
*  Louis Scott from Celtic pride. Well, you forget it jumped on that. Yeah. You forbid that. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5254.16s)]
*  Buddy from Hoosiers who quit the team came back and really like became a lockdown defender. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5258.88s)]
*  Like shades of Dyson Daniels on the Hawks this year. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5264.64s)]
*  Nobody took the like Mike guy. Yeah. Calvin Cambridge. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5268.4800000000005s)]
*  Nobody took Andre 3000's character from semi-pro Clarence Withers. Yeah. Chris took Jackie Moon. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5273.52s)]
*  I thought [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5279.2s)]
*  nobody took the kid from finding Forester. Yeah. Jamal Wallace liked his game. How about [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5285.68s)]
*  Odin James from Oh, was he on anyone's board? No, but that's what I find for it. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5294.72s)]
*  Just as Billy Shakespeare imagined it, a basketball player. This is a rough podcast for Eddie [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5300.5599999999995s)]
*  because there were no Eddie picks including Stacey Patton played by Malik Sealy. Would [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5306.4800000000005s)]
*  you have included Kevin Garnett from Uncut Gems is eligible? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5310.64s)]
*  Yeah, that could have been, that could have been a good pick. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5316.8s)]
*  Nobody took Quincy McCall. You took his wife. And then a bust strap from Hoosiers and chubby [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5320.24s)]
*  from Teen Wolf for the big bench guys that I think were pretty shocked by. And then nobody took gem. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5327.04s)]
*  I guess somebody wanted gem in the locker room. All right. Go ahead. So here are the teams [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5332.96s)]
*  and you guys can decide who won. Chris Ryan, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5337.6s)]
*  Neon Boudo, LeBron from Trainwreck, Shep from Above the Rim, Jimmy Chitwood, Billy Hoyle, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5343.28s)]
*  Jim Carroll from the Basketball Diaries, Jackie Moon, and a coaching staff of Birdie, Rusty, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5348.72s)]
*  and Shooter with Kelso as the GM and Krista from the Town as the owner. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5355.6s)]
*  So that's Krista's team. Fantasy has Bo Cruz at center, a little undersized. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5365.92s)]
*  Jesus Shuttlesworth, Ricky Rowe, Uncle Drew, Sydney Dean. I miss I wrote somebody down twice. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5371.68s)]
*  Of course, Brian Flanagan from Brian Flanagan and Sandy Lyle and Sandy Lyle from along Camp [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5379.280000000001s)]
*  Holly. Not the strongest bench in the league, but weak bench. People want to get your guys [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5383.92s)]
*  of foul trouble and see if Brian Flanagan or Sandy Lyle. That's very tips of you. Yeah. We don't [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5389.68s)]
*  second apron Jesus Shuttleworth contract. It's an issue. Jack from the way back as your coach. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5394.64s)]
*  Yep. Danny Sharp, Bodie is your assistance. Tom from Triple Frontier. So glad I got an ovation [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5400.24s)]
*  from the crowd. And then Joe Cabot as your owner. And then my team, a little undersized with number [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5406.16s)]
*  45 from Team Wolf at center, but the guy's a fighter, man. I just believe in him. Moses Guthrie [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5414.24s)]
*  and Hussler, two real NBA players. Butch McCray, a guard with Teen Wolf. That backcourt's amazing. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5420.5599999999995s)]
*  I think Fandel just made me the favorite. Kyle Watson coming off the bench with Fletch with an [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5427.2s)]
*  Afro. Gabe Kaplan, Merriman and Michael Cheretto as my coaching staff. Neil McCauley is the GM [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5432.32s)]
*  and Danny Ocean as the owner. And then here's Shay. All right. So I didn't read the team. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5438.4s)]
*  Bedazzled Brendan Frazier, Snake Plissken, Wood Harris, Monica, Android, Air Bud, Spaceman, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5448.08s)]
*  Coach Finstock, Donnie, Eisenberg, TT from Set It Off and Dalton Russell. Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5455.679999999999s)]
*  Is that our winner? Yeah. I think we know who won. I'm like fucking RC Buford up here, baby. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5462.48s)]
*  This feels like a hometown verdict. We never had a chance. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5472.08s)]
*  He already said he was going to fight all if he stole the Spurs from San Antonio. Now you're [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5476.48s)]
*  rooting for his team? All right. What was the most surprising pick for you, CR? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5481.92s)]
*  I'm like probably the Android from Prometheus getting picked before I got to it. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5486.080000000001s)]
*  That's going to wrap it up for us. CR, what are you working on? You still podcasting? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5498.240000000001s)]

*  A part narrative podcast series called Podslut, The Rise of Chris Ryan. It's about all the pods [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5512.16s)]
*  he does over the course of one week. It's like a follow doc. How many ringer pods have you been on? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5518.5599999999995s)]
*  Like over 20? Because we have like 40. Do you think you've been on half of them at this point? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5522.96s)]
*  This is the part of the behind the music where I'm like, I can do anything. But then Bill's like, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5527.28s)]
*  we knew right then that Chris was over-sticking. Mountains of coke everywhere. It's like, no, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5531.84s)]
*  put me on more pods. Sean Fennesey, you got the Oscars coming up? Yes, sir. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McFXpQozgz0&t=5538.88s)]
