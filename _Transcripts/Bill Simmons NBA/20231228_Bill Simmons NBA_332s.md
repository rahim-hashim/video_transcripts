# There are Four Generations in the NBA Right Now | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLiA1VZT3k)
*  Big picture thought on this NBA season.
*  This is the first time ever we've had four generations going at the same time.
*  So what does that mean?
*  Well, if you go the guys from the two thousands, which I would call the Kobe
*  generation, those are all the guys.
*  Their draft had to be in the two thousands.
*  So you got LeBron, who's the oldest guy in the league, which is amazing.
*  Uh, Curry, KD, Harden, Butler, Russ, CP3, they all belong to some sort of generation.
*  And I guess the tie would be Kobe, right?
*  They, they competed against him at least when he was still really good.
*  Maybe some of them were on the dream team.
*  And normally that would be this generation that had already been retired.
*  But now with the longevity and the way that we're more of an offense league, all
*  this stuff, the older guys can just keep going.
*  So we have those guys.
*  Then we have the 2010 to 2014, the international generation.
*  All those guys came in during those drafts, Joker, Embiid, Yannis, Dame,
*  Kawaii, PG, AD, Kyrie, they all feel like collectively part of something.
*  It's like LeBron's already been in the league.
*  They're coming in.
*  They're aware of him.
*  He's the guy.
*  Uh, the three point shooting starting to come in in a real way.
*  Uh, these guys, they have length except for Dame, uh, and I guess, except for Kyrie
*  shooting, playmaking.
*  There is just this new, this new kind of type of basketball that you can kind of
*  really feel by, I would say 2015, 16 range combined with the old guys.
*  But then you have the social media generation coming in 2015 and 2019.
*  This is SGA, Luca, Tatum, Booker, Bam, Mitchell, Brunson, Jalen, Murray, towns.
*  All these guys feel like they all belong together too, and they're not part of
*  the previous generation.
*  And you think of these guys now it's a little more heliocentric.
*  Uh, you got, most of these guys are now ascending into being some of the best
*  players in the league, but then we have this other generation that's coming this
*  space and pace generation, all guys that were rookies in 2020 or later, Ja,
*  Caliburton, Edwards, Chet, Wemby, Palo, Shungoon, Maxie, Franz.
*  This is the most good players we've ever had.
*  And I think that's why, as, as we get closer to the playoffs, um, this is why
*  the season's been so much fun.
*  This is why there's been so much variance.
*  You can watch two teams play and then two weeks later, it's a completely
*  different game.
*  And just in general, I don't know where this league is going from a talent
*  standpoint, but this is the most talent I feel like it's ever had.
*  I always felt like 1993 was the most talent, but when you, when you talk
*  about those Kobe generation guys and how LeBron and Kurt and KDL were
*  LeBron and Kurt and KD, and even Harden and Butler, those guys are still
*  primetime dudes that are going to affect the title race.
*  All four of these generation guy, uh, these generation classes, basically.
*  All might be in the final four in the playoffs.
*  Like even if you go to the space and pace guys, Edwards, Chet, those guys
*  might be in the Western finals going against each other.
*  And this is like the newest possible generation.
*  So I look back to like the, I don't know, the 93 season where is MJ the last year
*  before baseball, when we were really loaded then and the young guys were like,
*  it was like morning at LJ and Charlotte, we had Shaq kind of feeling it out on
*  Orlando, but it seemed really far away and inconceivable that those guys would
*  actually be in the title picture.
*  The space and pace generation, they're already in.
*  And like, I read this in John Schuman's column yesterday.
*  Uh, he does a great power rankings that you should read on MBA.com every week.
*  He said last year, the Kings scored 118.6 points per a hundred positions.
*  That was the highest mark we'd ever had in the history of the NBA.
*  It's a big deal.
*  Now we have five teams that are doing better than that.
*  So you look at all the offense and this goes back to what Steve Kerr said the
*  other day when he was complaining about Yoke H where if we can't figure out how
*  to play defense against these guys, this is just what the league's going to look
*  like. The guys are getting smarter and smarter, getting people in foul trouble.
*  The points are going to keep going up, but this might be inevitable.
*  Like all those guys I listed for the most part are, are pretty,
*  pretty, pretty great offensive players down the line.
*  Even somebody like Brunson, like that social media generation, SGA,
*  Luca, Tatum, Booker, Bam, Mitchell, Brunson, Jalen Brown, Jamal Murray,
*  Carl Towns.
*  That could be like the Olympic dream team, potentially.
*  I mean, I know we have a couple of foreign guys in there,
*  but you think like Brunson who was a second round pick,
*  who was kind of an afterthought for the Mavs. They let him go,
*  which is one of the dumbest decisions the last 15 years. And Brunson now,
*  I was on a tech start the other day trying to figure out who he is offensively.
*  And we, we literally couldn't figure out.
*  It was like Earl Monroe crossed with John Lucas, a guy,
*  none of you have probably ever heard of. He was the number one pick in 1976.
*  He was an awesome crafty point guard who had a ton of cocaine problems,
*  but Brunson's kind of an afterthought offensively,
*  cause there's so many crazy things happening this year.
*  And if you took this Brunson season and you moved it back 20 years,
*  he would be first team all NBA. So I don't know where we're going with the talent,
*  but I know that it's made the power poles harder than ever to figure out.
