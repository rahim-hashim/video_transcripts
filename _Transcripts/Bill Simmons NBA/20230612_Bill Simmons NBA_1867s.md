# The "I Won't Be Surprised If You're on Another Team in Two Months" Draft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk)
*  So we had so much fun during the worst GM draft last week that we created another [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=0.0s)]
*  draft that, uh, we haven't come up with the perfect title yet, but it's something [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=3.86s)]
*  like, I'm just not going to be surprised if you're not, if you're on another team [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=8.26s)]
*  in two months, that's the draft. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=12.24s)]
*  I can't believe it's not Lillard draft. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=14.02s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=17.3s)]
*  Uh, basically the last couple of years. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=18.42s)]
*  And I remember if you go back a year ago, Rossella and I are talking about the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=23.46s)]
*  nets and both of us had spidey senses with them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=27.78s)]
*  Like, you know what? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=32.24s)]
*  Just wouldn't be shocked if shit started going down with that team, but we, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=34.2s)]
*  we, there was no smoke signals. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=37.82s)]
*  There was no KD trade requests, nothing, but it was almost, we were like hunters [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=40.04s)]
*  in the wilderness where it was like, I smell bear feces down that we let's go [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=44.84s)]
*  left because I just catching a whiff of the bear feces. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  If we go right, let's go left. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=53.08s)]
*  Did you watch some sort of outdoors movie on the flight? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=55.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=58.44s)]
*  Might've, might've watched blood diamond. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=59.96s)]
*  Nah, I might've watched blood diamond. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=61.78s)]
*  Chris Ryan and I might be doing blood diamond for the rewatchable soon. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=63.64s)]
*  And I was watching Leo in that one. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=66.78s)]
*  Is blood diamond good? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=69.34s)]
*  Blood diamond's amazing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=71.08s)]
*  I've watched it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=73.72s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=74.56s)]
*  It's Leo. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=75.18s)]
*  No, watch it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=75.6s)]
*  Blood diamond's great. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=76.38s)]
*  I got to watch it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=77.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=78.18s)]
*  So Leo's character in that movie could smell the, you know, kind of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=78.26s)]
*  smell the different sense. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=82.4s)]
*  So you and I can smell the sense of the summer in the NBA. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=84.36s)]
*  And, uh, I'll give you first pick. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=87.84s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=91.12s)]
*  I want to counter punch because I always get first pick. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=91.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=94.36s)]
*  I'll go first then. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=94.66s)]
*  Great. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=96.34s)]
*  My first pick is Bradley Beal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=99.76s)]
*  I think winger is going to go into this wizard job and he's already [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=103.98s)]
*  had some interesting quotes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=106.92s)]
*  I don't think he wants to go 38 and 44 or 41 and 41 or 42 and 40 or 39 and 43 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=108.78s)]
*  for the next five years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  I think he wants a real plan and it feels a little blow it upy to me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=118.18s)]
*  And I think that's actually what they should do. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  They have the seventh pick. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=123.92s)]
*  They have some assets. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=125.68s)]
*  I don't, if your big three is poor Zingas and Beal and Kyle Kuzma, I hate to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=127.66s)]
*  break it to you, but there's not going to be a lot of long postseason runs in your [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=132.26s)]
*  future. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=136.36s)]
*  And I think Bradley Beal, even though he has a no trade clause, um, he's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=138.1s)]
*  going to be traded this summer. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=144.78s)]
*  Man, it sounds like somebody's been doing some chatting on the phone. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=148.34s)]
*  That's a great pick. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=153.38s)]
*  What made you, what made you, oh, you like that pick? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  Was he on your board? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=156.14s)]
*  He was my first pick. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=157.38s)]
*  I was going to take it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=158.38s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=158.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=159.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=160.98s)]
*  So what do you have anything to add? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=161.26s)]
*  I just think with the overhaul, everything, it might be time, you know, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=164.02s)]
*  maybe before it's another year, you know, he doesn't play a ton. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=167.1s)]
*  He's getting older. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=170.98s)]
*  Uh, you know, the problem with the wizards is we said throughout it is [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=172.26s)]
*  they're paying a money to guys that are kind of B B minuses. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=175.86s)]
*  They have a massive decision of Przingus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=179.82s)]
*  That contract would scare the hell out of me. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=182.02s)]
*  You could say, Hey, let them walk. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=184.46s)]
*  But then you always worry about the asset. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=185.9s)]
*  Uh, I would, I would hope they would try to. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=188.06s)]
*  You can't just go like, Hey, we don't like any of our guys. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=190.58s)]
*  This team hasn't been very good. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=192.38s)]
*  Like a lot of times the problem with the job is you end up signing guys [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=193.62s)]
*  who didn't even want, but it starts with Beal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=195.9s)]
*  The Beal move is the first piece to this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=200.5s)]
*  And now that it feels like they finally kind of, they're trying to turn the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=202.54s)]
*  page, even if some of the, some of the guys back will feel like, Hey, wait, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=205.14s)]
*  this isn't a completely revamped roster. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  I just really liked the pick. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=209.7s)]
*  I liked the pick, but it was always up to Beal and it always felt like, and for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=210.73999999999998s)]
*  years we were right about this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=214.38s)]
*  In that every time he was like the next guy, the next guy, the next guy, we were [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=216.7s)]
*  consistently saying like, I think he wants the five year deal first, and then [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=220.22s)]
*  he'll, he'll start calling his shots. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=224.78s)]
*  And this might be like a collaborative thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  So, uh, man, we almost could have led the pod with this because now there's two [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=231.18s)]
*  directions we could go with Beal close to Jason Tatum. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=235.1s)]
*  It's the Beal Jalen Brown rumor has always been the rumor, but I don't know [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  why you would trade Jalen Brown because the new CBA is good. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=244.9s)]
*  I wouldn't trade Jalen for Beal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=249.78s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I wouldn't either, but I'm saying with the second apron now, it's like the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=252.26s)]
*  whole reason if you're going to trade Jalen Brown or because you don't want to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=256.7s)]
*  have two super expensive guys. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=259.38s)]
*  So then you can't trade him for Bradley Beal counter to my point that I just [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=260.78s)]
*  made, you got to be in the keep my superstar happy business. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=264.74s)]
*  It's the number one business to be in these days in the M if you're an MBA [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  owner, Tatum loves Beal and maybe that's the reason you do it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=274.98s)]
*  I don't think they will, but that's the only reason in a million years, I would [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=282.26s)]
*  think it would make sense to do a trade with Jalen Brown and Bradley Beal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=286.66s)]
*  Now I've watched and offered them number seven and Bradley Beal for Brown and, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=289.42s)]
*  you know, Rob Williams, Ishmeth Sprinkles. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=296.1s)]
*  They maybe, yeah, maybe make some stuff work. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=299.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=302.1s)]
*  I wouldn't do it, but I just don't think the, Hey, we have to make sure Tatum is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  happy at all times thing could be ruled out, but my guess, my bet, the odds on [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=306.98s)]
*  favorite, I would put the minus 200 would be Philadelphia. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=311.5s)]
*  By the way, I'm aware Ishmeth is not on the team. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=314.86s)]
*  It just, he just feels like, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=317.3s)]
*  Ishmeth's always good for those sprinkle jokes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=319.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=321.66s)]
*  Uh, my odds on favorite is Philadelphia and I don't even think it's close. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=321.82000000000005s)]
*  Beal, Beal and Embiid they're friends. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=325.98s)]
*  Embiid was trying to get him two years ago, which I kept telling people on [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=329.3s)]
*  this podcast, they ended up going with Hardin instead Embiid was pushing hard [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  for Beal Hardin's going to leave. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=335.1s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to get go. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=338.14000000000004s)]
*  And if you're Washington, um, and you and I have, we've had some, uh, off podcast [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=339.42s)]
*  arguments about what Beal's value actually is, but for the money that he's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=344.9s)]
*  making, where it goes into the fifties pretty quickly, um, I just don't, I don't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=349.26s)]
*  think that's an asset in the second apron NBA. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=354.82s)]
*  I don't see it, but if you're Philly and you're going to lose Hardin and now I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=357.1s)]
*  have the shooter, that's probably a better fit with Embiid anyway, and I have [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=361.1s)]
*  Tobias Harris and his expiring contract. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=365.74s)]
*  It's a couple future draft picks. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=369.5s)]
*  I could probably throw that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=371.3s)]
*  I can probably find in my, in my pocket somewhere. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=372.3s)]
*  And if you're Washington, it's like, you know what we got out of the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=375.46s)]
*  Beal contract, we have Harris's and expiring and, uh, and we're rebooting everything. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=377.98s)]
*  Well, if you were just, and we're all doing hypotheticals here, even though I [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=384.34s)]
*  would agree that the Beal thing, especially if Beal were to say like, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=387.9s)]
*  okay, maybe it has run its course, new guys in here and the whole deal. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=391.02s)]
*  Um, but it has to go somewhere that he wants to go because he has the hammer. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=394.38s)]
*  Well, does he though? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=399.9s)]
*  He, I mean, in the old trade clause, he could just say, no, no, thanks. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=401.14s)]
*  Hey, we traded you to Portland. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=405.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=408.26s)]
*  It was like, we traded you to Portland. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  Good news. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=409.82s)]
*  It's like, now you actually did it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  And I vote no, I'm not going to Portland. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=411.3s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=413.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=414.42s)]
*  Um, cause I was thinking about the extension, but right. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=415.18s)]
*  So a guy like Beal though, you don't, you shouldn't have to give up an all [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=417.58s)]
*  NBA player for him, not at the price. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  That's, that's not the way these transactions work. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=427.22s)]
*  So that's why I think the keep Tatum happy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=429.62s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, so what you did, and this is all hypothetical, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  which we're not even saying is going to happen is you decided instead of like, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=434.66s)]
*  Hey, here's the one young guy and some salary filler and some pics with different [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=438.1s)]
*  swaps and different protections on them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=442.18s)]
*  The whole thing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=443.82000000000005s)]
*  No, here's a guy in his prime that just made all NBA. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=444.66s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=448.02000000000004s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=448.74s)]
*  So that's why that's a non-starter as far as the Philly part of it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=449.62s)]
*  Like, look, not breaking news. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=453.42s)]
*  Not exactly the biggest hardened guy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=456.54s)]
*  Um, but at least harden gets into the playoffs. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=458.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=461.74s)]
*  Beal can't, Beal can't even get his team in to anything that like, I think one of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  the worst, I was talking with somebody about this the other night, I think one [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=466.14000000000004s)]
*  of the worst playoffs series as far as like talent, Oh, it was off of the Miami [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  stuff again, like back to like, when's the last time you saw teams like that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=471.54s)]
*  were just less talent that Isaiah Thomas Celtics team that beat the Wizards in [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=474.98s)]
*  the second round six years ago, like that was the first, that was the first sign [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=478.86s)]
*  of like, what's wrong with these guys? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=483.94s)]
*  But wall was still there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=485.66s)]
*  Morris was still there and they, they talk shit to everybody and whatever. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=486.62s)]
*  And then I feel like everybody kind of became team Beal because wall was hurt. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=490.62s)]
*  Wall was like a different person. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=494.54s)]
*  It was good in that game seven. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=495.46s)]
*  I remember he was, he was, but you know, if you're, if you're worth this kind [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=496.78s)]
*  of thing and it kind of gets back to your second apron deal is maybe even just [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=501.26s)]
*  two years ago, you go, all right, this contract sucks, whatever, not a big deal. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=505.06s)]
*  But now you're going, wait, I don't know that we can have an even Lillard [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=509.38s)]
*  kind of falls into this. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=512.82s)]
*  Can you have this kind of transaction with dudes who owed $60 million in three [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=513.9000000000001s)]
*  years with this new apron design? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=518.2600000000001s)]
*  Let me give you the Beal numbers right now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=521.7s)]
*  It's 43.2 next season, 46.7 jumps up to 50.2, 53.66 in the 2025-26 season [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=524.0200000000001s)]
*  player option for 57.1. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=537.34s)]
*  So he has, it's one of my favorite Priscilla jokes. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=539.34s)]
*  He's got like $205 million remaining after, after we get there. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=542.46s)]
*  So right now, if you trade them before July 1st, he's at 43.2 and you know, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=545.46s)]
*  Harris fits like Harris makes 40 and there's a way to make that work. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=549.6600000000001s)]
*  And Washington would just be basically cutting bait. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=553.6600000000001s)]
*  Maybe they could reroute it out. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=555.86s)]
*  And then they could just, you know, they could just, you know, they could just [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=556.98s)]
*  do it, you know, they could just do it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=560.4200000000001s)]
*  And then they could just, you know, they could just, you know, they could just [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=561.7800000000001s)]
*  do it, you know, they could just do it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=565.1s)]
*  And Washington would just be basically cutting bait. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=566.54s)]
*  Maybe they could reroute Harris, buy him out, whatever. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=568.42s)]
*  Um, the other way to do it is if Hardin ends up going to Houston and you try to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=571.18s)]
*  figure out some sort of goofy sign in trade with them, we can get the entire [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=576.3s)]
*  salary cap exception from trading Hardin out, then you could just trade [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=580.3s)]
*  for Beal and keep Harris. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=586.02s)]
*  So let's say they say to Houston, Oh, you're going to take him anyway. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=588.62s)]
*  Well, what if you do this? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=591.1s)]
*  Start his contract at 47 million. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=592.06s)]
*  We'll give you like a second round pick in 2029. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=595.18s)]
*  We'll trade them to you in your cap space. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=598.06s)]
*  And then we get this trade exception. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=600.74s)]
*  We can just move Beal into it and keep Harris. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=602.06s)]
*  So my point is Philly's, Philly's the pick. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=605.0999999999999s)]
*  Who do you have with your first pick? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=610.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to add one little line to it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=612.78s)]
*  As much as I don't like Hardin, even I don't think he would pull a move. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=614.74s)]
*  Well, I shouldn't say that, but it's one of the all time loser moves. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=617.74s)]
*  If he leaves Philadelphia as a, you know, whatever you think of them as a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=622.26s)]
*  contender to be like, I'll just take Houston's cap space. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=625.34s)]
*  Like even I don't know that he would do that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=628.7s)]
*  Cause the money's the same. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=633.06s)]
*  The money's basically the same. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=634.38s)]
*  Does he care though? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=637.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=638.58s)]
*  I'm not, I'm just not sure that some of these guys care that much. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=638.8199999999999s)]
*  He's like, you know what? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  I, I've made an absolute shitload of money. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=642.54s)]
*  If you're hard and you've like, I've made $400 billion playing basketball or [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=645.18s)]
*  350 or 300, whatever the final number is. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=648.66s)]
*  You know, I had a great career. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=651.98s)]
*  I've gone to the hall of fame. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=652.82s)]
*  I won an MVP. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=654.42s)]
*  Like I really like living in Houston. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=655.98s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=658.1s)]
*  Maybe we'll be good in two years and we can win the title two years from now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=658.7s)]
*  But I love it here. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=661.74s)]
*  I want it to happen so bad. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=664.86s)]
*  It would be a very telling, uh, exclamation point in his legacy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=667.74s)]
*  I wanted it to happen so bad. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=673.9s)]
*  But I mean, they can sell them on email. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=675.7s)]
*  They could say like, Oh, wait, you're the first of many moves. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=677.54s)]
*  We're going to be good right away. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=680.4599999999999s)]
*  We're going to be competitive. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=682.18s)]
*  I think you could say he doesn't care. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=683.2199999999999s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=684.6999999999999s)]
*  And certainly like, you know, the way I would say most people finally come around [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=685.2199999999999s)]
*  on it where you would go, I mean, the only people that were fighting the reality of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=689.0999999999999s)]
*  who he is in the playoffs were the people that were emotionally invested in that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=693.8199999999999s)]
*  team having a good outcome. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=696.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=698.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=698.98s)]
*  Nobody wanted to admit it if you were still rooting for him the entire time. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=699.26s)]
*  But I still think most players would be like, dude, we have, we still have a chance. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=702.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=708.62s)]
*  Boston's all dinged up. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=708.94s)]
*  Who knows what's going to happen with them? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=710.3000000000001s)]
*  Milwaukee's kind of in this weird phase of like the beginning of phase two. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=712.1s)]
*  You know, Miami's not coming in next year as a favorite Brooklyn's kind of a mess. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=717.1800000000001s)]
*  Like the East is wide open. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=721.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=723.22s)]
*  So if you're Darrell Morey pitching this to harden, which I don't think Darrell [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=723.5400000000001s)]
*  gives a shit about the back end years of anything because his history shows he [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=729.18s)]
*  doesn't care. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=732.7399999999999s)]
*  He'll just be like, whatever, I'll figure out labor. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=733.7399999999999s)]
*  I've granted the PJ Tucker 40 year old. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=735.9799999999999s)]
*  The GM empowerment era. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=737.9799999999999s)]
*  But to go like, Hey, just give me one more. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=741.9799999999999s)]
*  We'll give you every last dollar we can give you. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=746.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=749.06s)]
*  And the way it works on the over 38 rule, like they could offer him five, but the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=749.78s)]
*  money has to fit in the first four. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=754.38s)]
*  So that's why it's the same money. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=755.8199999999999s)]
*  So they actually don't have the advantage they normally have. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=757.18s)]
*  I think everybody understands this has been over it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=758.94s)]
*  Then you factor in the state taxes that it's kind of from what I've looked at as a [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=760.5s)]
*  wash, but you'd still think like, Hey, I picked you up at the jet, man. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=763.86s)]
*  I tweeted about how good you were for like six years. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=769.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=771.86s)]
*  I'm literally carrying your legacy on my back. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=772.34s)]
*  I had, I wrote a dossier to fucking the NBA to save your legacy in 2018. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=775.62s)]
*  Like this is I've had your back, but can you give me one more year and then I'll [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=781.58s)]
*  trade you to Houston if you want to. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  If Embiid doesn't want to play with them though. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=789.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=791.4599999999999s)]
*  But who do you want to like, you want to play with Beal? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=791.66s)]
*  And Maxie gets more, it's basically, here's our big three Embiid, Beal and Maxie. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=796.06s)]
*  Brought in the sky with all this playoff success. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=800.9399999999999s)]
*  His name's Bradley Beal. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=803.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=804.62s)]
*  My first pick was Bradley Beal. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  What's your first pick? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=806.26s)]
*  The head of Zion's PR team. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=807.78s)]
*  Be a different team next year. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=811.5799999999999s)]
*  Fair. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=814.3399999999999s)]
*  So you think Zion's traded? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=815.58s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=817.78s)]
*  I don't think he's traded. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=818.62s)]
*  Uh, I think a guy having a ton of sex is not really going to ruin his [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  trade value all that much. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=824.62s)]
*  If you were playing and playing well, this would be treated a little differently. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=825.74s)]
*  But I'd say at this point now, after this entire week, I actually feel bad for him. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=828.66s)]
*  So there's my Zion commentary. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=833.22s)]
*  I've been there a couple of months ago. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=835.54s)]
*  What good cues to having sex with a ton of people? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=837.94s)]
*  No, I felt bad for him. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=840.46s)]
*  Oh, I think he's in the wrong city. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=842.98s)]
*  And I, I don't know. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=844.74s)]
*  I did the job thing too. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=846.3s)]
*  I think these guys in their early twenties that, I don't know, man, I [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=847.62s)]
*  think clearly they have nobody in their lives who could be like, yo, no, the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=854.22s)]
*  problem resign is the guys in his lives are also doing this with him most likely. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=861.5s)]
*  And they're like, this is sick. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=865.5s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=868.0600000000001s)]
*  This is great. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=868.9s)]
*  Like, uh, okay. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=869.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=870.74s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and, uh, this isn't, this isn't one of the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=871.02s)]
*  headliners. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=874.06s)]
*  I'm going to go John Collins. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=876.26s)]
*  He's finally out. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=877.78s)]
*  John Collins did not have that on my board. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=879.66s)]
*  He, this is it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=882.42s)]
*  They finally trade him after two years. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=883.34s)]
*  If his, could his agent just call and go, Hey guys, like he's just on the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=885.5s)]
*  FaceTime shrugging, being like, you've been trying to trade my guy forever. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=891.02s)]
*  He's like the new miles Turner. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=894.62s)]
*  So I was just, I was trying to think of certainty of certainty. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=896.22s)]
*  And then I'm not even certain. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=899.14s)]
*  It's not based on any information. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=900.3s)]
*  It just, there has to be a couple moving parts in Atlanta here. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=902.34s)]
*  I like it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=906.9s)]
*  My next pick. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=910.14s)]
*  I'm just going to go Dame Lillard because he just needs to go in the top three. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=913.1800000000001s)]
*  Good value. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=917.66s)]
*  Probably could have gone first. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=918.38s)]
*  I stay if scoot. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=921.1s)]
*  Was it going to be sitting there at number three? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=923.1s)]
*  I wouldn't even consider this, but I just think if, I don't know. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=924.9s)]
*  Uh, I don't know exactly who owns Portland these days. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=928.5s)]
*  There's always been weird rumors about, um, that they're not available for [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=931.58s)]
*  whatever reason, even though like Phil Knight's been trying to buy them and [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=935.98s)]
*  all this stuff, but, um, I just don't know how you take scoot Henderson [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=938.62s)]
*  and then keep Dame that makes no sense to me. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=941.86s)]
*  And I also think it does make any sense to trade scoot Henderson. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=944.74s)]
*  It makes way more sense to trade Dame than it does to trade scoot Henderson. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=947.6600000000001s)]
*  So Dame would be my pick. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=951.58s)]
*  There's another version of this where he goes number one, honestly. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=954.0200000000001s)]
*  So, um, I probably would have taken him with this pick now, despite us trying [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=956.86s)]
*  to have any conversation about where he actually fits and us not really coming [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=960.86s)]
*  to any kind of conclusion on it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=964.58s)]
*  Uh, I'll see your Dame and I'll go Grant Williams. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=965.82s)]
*  Great. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=970.74s)]
*  So you're, you really opened it up to the non-stars. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=971.14s)]
*  I, Grant Williams doesn't even count. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=973.74s)]
*  He's not, he's definitely going to be on another team next year. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=975.26s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=978.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=978.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=979.26s)]
*  Celtics next year. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=979.58s)]
*  I'm vetoing that one. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=980.5s)]
*  We're doing stars. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=981.78s)]
*  No, but great. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=983.54s)]
*  Williams is a hundred percent not going to be in the Celtics next year. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=984.02s)]
*  So basically it's, Hey, let's be wrong on eight of these. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=987.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=989.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=990.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=990.7800000000001s)]
*  Uh, we're doing stars. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=991.4200000000001s)]
*  I didn't, didn't realize I'll take Bruce Brown then. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=992.7800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=996.1s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=996.34s)]
*  Josh are ops out. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=997.7800000000001s)]
*  So you wanted us to come up with 10 stars that we think are likely to be [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1002.5s)]
*  stars are close. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1006.46s)]
*  No, not likely, but I wouldn't be surprised in August if this guy was on another team. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1008.0600000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1013.38s)]
*  Despite me disagreeing with the timing of the report from Chris Haynes, cause I [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1013.98s)]
*  don't know how you could know that Chris Paul was being waived on January or [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1017.54s)]
*  excuse me, June 7th, when they had three weeks from that date to figure out the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1021.5s)]
*  trade market for Aitin, the trade market for Chris Paul, do they want to keep him [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1025.46s)]
*  30 million? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1029.7s)]
*  Do they want to waive him, not stretch him, resign him if they do stretch him, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1030.34s)]
*  then it opens up some more cap space. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1034.02s)]
*  There are moves that exist that you cannot assume, you know. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1035.98s)]
*  So I think what happened is Paul meets with Phoenix on Wednesday. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1040.06s)]
*  Wave is brought up as an option. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1043.42s)]
*  Chris Haynes probably talked to Chris Paul. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1045.66s)]
*  I don't believe guys make stuff up. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1047.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't think Chris Haynes, but I just, it'd be like me guessing the lottery [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1049.1000000000001s)]
*  numbers one week and then the next week I was like, I told you, you may have gotten [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1052.3000000000002s)]
*  it right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1056.94s)]
*  There's no way you actually knew what the lottery numbers were. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1057.5s)]
*  So Chris Haynes could still be right about this, but I think value for somebody [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1060.0600000000002s)]
*  who's at least name recognition, cause Chris Paul is not a star anymore. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1063.5400000000002s)]
*  Uh, I'll take him. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1066.94s)]
*  No, Chris Paul is name. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1067.5800000000002s)]
*  Name recognition is a good way to frame this and it's a great pick. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1068.94s)]
*  The reason I was so stunned when Haynes tweeted that was because I didn't understand [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1071.82s)]
*  why they were making the decision now when you never know if there's a team that wants [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1077.26s)]
*  to give you an asset because they want to acquire Chris Paul so that it can wave him [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1081.3s)]
*  for 16 million and get off the cap and get off some asset. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1085.1399999999999s)]
*  That's a $32 million asset. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1088.6599999999999s)]
*  Get Chris Paul and then wave them. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1091.1399999999999s)]
*  So I just didn't add up to me. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1093.1399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1095.22s)]
*  Dallas could be like, we'll trade you Kyrie Irving, sign and trade. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1096.02s)]
*  We'll take Chris Paul back and then we'll keep them. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1100.8600000000001s)]
*  We can wave them. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1103.8600000000001s)]
*  We can flip them to a third team. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1104.5800000000002s)]
*  I just, there's too many options for him with that contract. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1105.8600000000001s)]
*  So we agree. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1109.98s)]
*  I guess I got to cross Christian Wood off my board. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1112.0200000000002s)]
*  I can't wait to know how many I'd love to know what your 10 stars were because this [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1119.6200000000001s)]
*  is hard. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1123.74s)]
*  Well, you're going to be jealous of this pick too. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1124.1000000000001s)]
*  Carl Anthony Towns. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1125.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1126.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1127.5s)]
*  Based on this, like the likelihood of it, you're right. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1128.06s)]
*  He should have gone higher. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1131.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1133.1s)]
*  He should have gone higher, but I would imagine they're going to try this one more [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1133.22s)]
*  time with everybody healthy. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1136.1s)]
*  It's that would be insane to be like, let's run it back. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1138.38s)]
*  We didn't see enough, not a big enough sample size of go bear towns and Anthony [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1140.9s)]
*  Edwards. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1145.6200000000001s)]
*  Plus we have to pay some point guard. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1146.1s)]
*  I just find it hard to believe he's going to be on the team next year, but maybe [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1148.74s)]
*  I'm nuts. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1151.78s)]
*  I mean, somebody's got to take Jalen at some point. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1153.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to wait. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1156.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1157.9s)]
*  I'll go Jared Allen. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1159.54s)]
*  What a great pick. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1163.22s)]
*  Really nice. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1166.58s)]
*  I like it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1167.7s)]
*  Cleveland's got to be a little scared here because the Mitchell window is [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1170.26s)]
*  already open. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1174.22s)]
*  And it's going to be a lot of things. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1175.22s)]
*  It's going to be a lot of things. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1176.58s)]
*  It's going to be a lot of things. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1177.9s)]
*  I'm a little scared here because the Mitchell window is already almost over. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1179.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1184.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1184.94s)]
*  And everything that could have got, like, there was such a great story, the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1185.94s)]
*  number one defense in the league. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1190.58s)]
*  That Nick series has to be in their heads. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1192.9s)]
*  We're like, what the fuck was that? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1195.98s)]
*  What, what just happened to our dudes? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1199.06s)]
*  Remember that third quarter stretch with Darius Garland? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1201.22s)]
*  How come that only happened like one time? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1203.94s)]
*  They were even worse coached in the Celtics in the playoffs. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1206.7s)]
*  And I'll tell you this. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1210.78s)]
*  I don't know if you've thought about this before, but why did they wave Kevin Love? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1211.62s)]
*  Guys have played in the finals right now. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1219.1s)]
*  He's on the Cavs. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1221.1s)]
*  I want to get Kevin Love on so bad, but I almost want to get him on so you can talk to him. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1222.3799999999999s)]
*  Like you can have him on. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1228.06s)]
*  I just want to be like, what happened, man? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1228.94s)]
*  How were the Cavs not playing you 25 minutes a game when they had no backup bigs? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1230.1799999999998s)]
*  The request has been in because I want to talk about the Miami run. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1234.62s)]
*  I want to talk about his cologne back in Minnesota numbers, which is still available. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1237.3799999999999s)]
*  I think at Dillard's.com, but I fight with, we get them. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1240.82s)]
*  I may tell Alison, let Bill have them. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1244.4599999999998s)]
*  Let he know. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1246.8999999999999s)]
*  I think we do it together. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1247.82s)]
*  I think we tag team them. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1249.3s)]
*  Um, by the way, congrats. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1251.1s)]
*  You just had a kid. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1253.4599999999998s)]
*  I'm going to stay in the Cavs since you opened the door. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1256.3s)]
*  I'm going to go Darius Garland. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1259.02s)]
*  No way. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1261.06s)]
*  That's the worst pick of the entire thing so far. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1261.78s)]
*  Listen, I had to have taken flyers. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1263.42s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1268.3400000000001s)]
*  What if somebody awesome is available? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1270.6200000000001s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1274.0600000000002s)]
*  Like a awesome young, potentially third team, all NBA point guard that shows that he [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1274.46s)]
*  can be a really good teammate and can shoot and pass. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1279.8600000000001s)]
*  What if Jalen Brown and Donovan Mitchell start texting each other about how much [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1282.54s)]
*  they like, how much fun it would be to play with each other? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1286.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1290.5s)]
*  This is a, I, Cleveland to me, I'm with you. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1291.3000000000002s)]
*  I thought the Jared Allen pick was good. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1295.14s)]
*  The only two people I know are going to be on that team are Mowby and, uh, and [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1296.94s)]
*  Mitchell. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1300.74s)]
*  I also could have taken Mitchell in that spot. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1302.6200000000001s)]
*  I would trade Jalen Brown and his niece Smith shoes for Darius Garland in two [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1307.66s)]
*  seconds. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1312.8200000000002s)]
*  I would too. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1314.14s)]
*  You, we, we, we are both aligned on young Darius. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1315.22s)]
*  I'm saying this segment's way more fun than me going. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1319.46s)]
*  If you take it, Grant Williams and Bert that's, uh, well, let me ask you this. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1324.94s)]
*  Are you sold on Garland and Donovan Mitchell as the foundation with Mowby as [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1331.82s)]
*  the, as that's your three going forward and we're going to win a title someday [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1337.82s)]
*  with these guys. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1341.1000000000001s)]
*  If you're asking me if they're going to win a title, the answer is more likely [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1342.18s)]
*  no than it is yet. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1345.46s)]
*  So it's one in 30 ads. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1346.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1348.22s)]
*  You've got me. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1348.5s)]
*  Uh, I think what was alarming was that Alan Mowby pairing, which was so good in [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1349.14s)]
*  the regular season defensively, cause those guys are that good defensively. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1353.46s)]
*  That then you become exposed because you have two non-offensive players on the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1357.34s)]
*  floor, like back in the old days, when it would be two or three of those guys, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1362.02s)]
*  the playoffs. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1365.18s)]
*  And now it's not only those two dudes, but then you're constantly searching for [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1366.18s)]
*  that small forward, which they never were really able to come up with an answer for [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1370.06s)]
*  that they felt good about. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1373.9s)]
*  So at times when you watch the Cavs offense, and then when you take out one [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1374.86s)]
*  of the guards, you're like, is Mowby even somebody who initiates his own offense? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1377.86s)]
*  Certainly not a playoff level, right? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1381.34s)]
*  Alan, Alan's still a little reluctant for me, even though I'd love to have him. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1383.54s)]
*  He's fallen off. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1388.02s)]
*  To me, it's not a big four. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1389.2199999999998s)]
*  Like you and I are aligned. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1390.62s)]
*  I would not, I would trade Mitchell before I traded Garland, but if they [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1392.8999999999999s)]
*  traded Garland for like some awesome small forward or somebody who fit better [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1395.9799999999998s)]
*  on paper than Mitchell, I wouldn't be like stunned. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1402.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1405.06s)]
*  You're up. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1405.34s)]
*  I, by the way, I think that might be the one that makes the most sense. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1406.22s)]
*  Is give the ball back to Mitchell. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1411.98s)]
*  Utah days. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1415.26s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of what I love so much about what I saw from [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1416.26s)]
*  Cleveland this year is that Mitchell. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1418.46s)]
*  And you know, despite what the playoffs were, do we realize what this guy did in [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1420.3000000000002s)]
*  some of these games this season? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1423.5800000000002s)]
*  Like he was insane. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1424.74s)]
*  He was like in the MVP conversation at the beginning of the year. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1426.3400000000001s)]
*  So, um, that, that playoff thing shook me to my core and I didn't work for the team, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  but the Mitchell Brown, Mobley Allen thing, did you just stumble on something [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1434.54s)]
*  amazing that you also would like? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1440.78s)]

*  The other would be Siakam. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlG5aW3YEk&t=1454.78s)]
