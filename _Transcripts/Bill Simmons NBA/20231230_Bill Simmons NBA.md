# Reacting to the OG Anunoby Trade | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEiVECay15o)
*  This is one of my favorite trades in a while because we have no answers yet on all four of these guys
*  and I feel like both teams won the trade but I'm excited to hear what you guys think.
*  Yeah, where do we want to start Justin? Do you want to lay out the specifics?
*  Sure, we can go through the details. So out of nowhere, there's really no prelude to this trade
*  as there typically is for most of these trades. The Knicks get OGN and OB, Precious and Chua,
*  Malachi, Flynn, the Raptors get RJ Barrett, Emmanuel Quickly and a 20-24 second round pick.
*  From Detroit, so that's almost definitely the 31st pick in the draft.
*  Not nothing.
*  So that's a pretty good asset.
*  Right. And so now this isn't Prime, Shaquille O'Neal, which is what we thought was the price
*  for OGN and OB for the past two years, but it seems like this is a pretty good trade
*  for both sides. Bill, what did you think here?
*  I'm excited to kind of have answers on all these guys. That was my first thought. OGN and OB,
*  the chemistry has been off with the Raptors for three years. They keep changing the guys,
*  but him and Siakam and maybe two others have been there the whole time. So at some point,
*  maybe it's you. Is he just a 15 points a game, three rebounds, a couple threes and great defense
*  guy? Is there a little more there? I don't know. Quickly really want to see him have his own team.
*  RJ, I have no idea and we could talk about him later. And then Precious and Tibbs just
*  feels like a match made in heaven. So I watched the Raptors coincidentally last night play the
*  Celtics as the Celtics tried to keep their undefeated home streak alive, which I know
*  you guys are riveted by. And we're missing half of our starters somehow outlast the Raptors,
*  but it was the same feeling I've gotten watching the Raptors all year, Rob. It's like this team's
*  off. The pieces don't totally work. We felt this way. This is your three of that now. And it was
*  just like, what is this team? So it was clear they were going to do something. Did you think this was
*  the most they could get for Ann and OB? Interesting question. Cause yeah, Justin, you framed it
*  in terms of the Shaquille O'Neal level hall we've all been talking about. And I think a lot of that
*  stems from the Raptors reportedly turning down. I think it was three first round picks from Memphis
*  a few seasons ago in terms of that kind of trade negotiation. And that's kind of set the market and
*  the conversation around Ann and OB for a long time. I wonder if we misread that, not as the Raptors
*  saying three picks isn't enough, but just categorically as a franchise, we're not interested
*  in starting from scratch. What we want is players like this, you know, admittedly a wild card and
*  RJ Barrett, a guy who I, yeah, I don't know how to forecast his future at all, but I'm most excited
*  young player wise at quickly's fit here. Like quickly and Scotty Barnes, that is a match made
*  in heaven in terms of a point guard who is never going to be a super high level playmaker, but a
*  good shooter, a good defender, a guy who knows how to play without the ball, pairing him with your ball
*  dominant creative wing, who's a great passer. That makes a lot of sense. And then RJ kind of slotting
*  in as we'll see what we can get between those two. So maybe it's more along those lines where
*  Toronto, look, I'm pleased as hell that they honestly made a trade that feels like a Christmas
*  miracle in itself. So I'm happy to kind of judge these returns and see what quickly can do there.
*  Did I miss Emmanuel quickly becoming the new Chris Paul? Because everything that I have seen
*  coming off of this trade is that quickly is the best player in the trade. He needs a new start
*  in order to really show what his value is. I am a big quickly fan. I always kind of thought of him
*  more as the microwave Jamal Crawford late stage sort of player than he is maybe Nick's level
*  Jamal Crawford. And so I guess what is quickly at this point? Well, that's the thing is he doesn't
*  have to be the guy coming off the bench to put up points. He can do that and he can slot in next to
*  Jalen Brunson as he was a part of the Knicks best lineups this season with Brunson and Randall
*  playing more of a tertiary role. But now we get to see kind of what he has as more of a lead guard,
*  or at least kind of a secondary creator alongside guys like Barnes and Seahawking, which
*  that feels like a pretty comfortable spot for him. I'll tell you one thing quickly is a guy who sucked
*  in the playoffs for the next. And it's tough because, and we saw the Warriors were in this
*  spot with Jordan Poole who did not suck in the playoffs for them at least two years ago,
*  because he was one of the reasons they won the title. You get in this spot where you don't want
*  to pay $30 million a year for a guy who's like a little too good to be your sixth man, but not
*  quite good enough to be your lead guy. And the guy who has the ball in the last five minutes
*  in the game. I also feel like I look at this from a Knicks side, I tweeted this today. Can you get,
*  can you find 80 to 90% of what quickly did for you with other players that are available in the
*  trade market? Like we know Utah wants to trade Jordan Clarkson at this point. They have all these
*  guards that need to play. Could you turn in expiring into Jordan Clarkson and then hope he's
*  80 to 85% as good as quickly was. And I also had, he was a restricted free agent coming up
*  and is the type of guy that I think another team would have come in and been like, we're going to
*  put the Knicks to the fire here. Here's 110 million or whatever the max was. Are you guys
*  ready to pay $25 million a year for a sixth man? Then there's the Brunson piece of it, Justin,
*  where the Brunson has the ball at the time. And if you're at the end of games and you're playing
*  Brunson and quickly together, I'm going to be able to get whatever shot I want on the other side.
*  Right. So your offense has to be spectacular. And this is what I said last week on my pod. I just
*  felt like the Knicks were between, they weren't explosive enough, but then they also weren't big
*  enough without Robinson. So it's like, what is this team? This is a team that's just not a threat
*  in the East. So now you have Anna Noby, now you're better defensively and there's still one move,
*  one more move coming, right? If they're really serious about this year, I don't feel like they're
*  done yet. Yeah. And I know he definitely feels like he fits the next type where and an OB at his
*  best offensively, despite the fact that he thinks he should have this different role, be able to
*  handle the ball more. He needs to be able to play bully ball and stand in the corner and shoot
*  threes. That's what he's good at. And that fits what Tim's wants to do. He just wants to out muscle
*  teams a lot of the time. And it does clear up as you were saying, Bill, opportunities for Brunson
*  to just be magical, which he has at various points in the season. The flip side of this is it also
*  opens up opportunities for Julius Randall to be magical. And I think that's more like dark magic
*  that nobody wants in their lives. But at the same time, this does feel like it clarifies that
*  starting Nick's lineup a little bit. And I think you hit the key point there, Bill. I think it also
*  gives them runway to figure out the next move down the line. It might be disappointing for Nick's
*  fans at this point. They're waiting for a superstar. Finally, we talk about him, we talk about Mitchell
*  and it's a star role player in OG and Inobi. But if anything, I think this just makes it easier
*  to bring on someone like even a Mitchell, maybe not the best fit, but the next guy who is going
*  to lead the next Nick's era. I think OG is a perfect fit for that sort of team. Yeah. And RJ was not
*  going to be a fit for that kind of team. Just by skill set. It's not even just the difference in
*  their percentages shooting, but how they're guarded. And teams just don't respect RJ's jumper at all.
*  It leads to a lot of clutter in the lane, which is why the Knicks have to out muscle people,
*  because it's the only way they're ever going to get to the basket with kind of the spacing they
*  had set up. You're losing a good shooter and quickly, but you're gaining a good shooter who's
*  big and Inobi. And the timing of this trade does not feel like an accident. Like the Knicks just
*  got absolutely bodied by the magic. Franz Wagner, Apollo, Ben Carro, the exact kind of game where
*  you could use OG and Inobi. The Raptors just had a starting lineup change earlier this week where
*  they took Dennis Schroeder out of their starting lineup, trying to get more spacing on the floor,
*  more shooting on the floor. Now both teams are kind of getting what they need for the moment,
*  but they're moves that could serve both franchises long-term ultimately. And I like the idea of
*  Inobi as a stepping stone toward what this team can ultimately be in. Wouldn't you know it? Another
*  CAA client in New York. Like how does this keep happening? Isn't it the Rose's son who is OG's
*  agent? I think that's true. So I would flip that around the other way. They had like real ties to
*  quickly because I've heard the CAA thing a few times. Quickly was a very difficult guy for those.
*  I think they knew quickly since he was like a junior in high school. The RJ, let's take these
*  guys one at a time. Yep. Because all the Knicks fans that I know were super frustrated and kind
*  of like either half out, three-fourths out or all the way out on RJ because he's not a guy that
*  necessarily if you ISO them, you can't do anything. And now we have cool stats where you can look all
*  this stuff up, right? Not awesome as the ball-hinder and pick and roll. Not awesome as a nice old guy.
*  Okay at post-ups. Spotty three-point shooter, but a guy that if you watch on the right night, you're
*  like, oh, he's interesting. He plays really hard. There's something here. Like I liked him for a
*  while, but now it's year four and you kind of, you start becoming who you are in year four. And to me,
*  he's not consistent enough. I thought he needed to change his scenery. So good gamble for Toronto
*  and he's Canadian, which leads us toward maybe this is the gateway for the wig and see outcome
*  trade that I've been pushing forever and just put more Canadians on that team. But I guess,
*  what do you guys think ultimately about RJ? Like, is he ever an all-star? Is he ever the third best
*  guy in a finals team? Like I don't see either of those things for him. Well, Bill, I'm just glad
*  you're here for this historic moment of bringing the Canadian diaspora a little bit closer to home.
*  I know this has been a passion of yours for a long time. So for years, for literally 25 years,
*  I've wanted it and now we're getting closer. Yeah, but I'm pretty flaky on RJ Justin. Like I,
*  again, there are nights where you believe in it, but it feels like just about the most hollow and
*  the least reliable 18 to 19 points a game you're going to find in the NBA. Yeah. Well, the other
*  thing is, and Rossello has been talking about this on his pod for, I think, two years. It was
*  weird that he didn't play crunch time at all. Like I think he was seventh in crunch time minutes for
*  them, Rossello said two weeks ago, which to me is the ultimate red flag. If your coach is thinking
*  in the last five minutes of games, you're not one of my five, then it's time for you to probably
*  get traded. And then if quickly in Brunson were two of your five, what are you going to do? You're
*  not winning four playoff rounds with that. So you mentioned this was the stepping stone type of
*  trade. I can't wait to bring the Celtics into this guys. You know, it's been almost what? How 11
*  minutes. How are they related? Well, we traded for Ray Allen in 2007 and me and all the other Celtic
*  fans were like, what are we doing? We have Paul Pearson, Ray Allen and nothing. What is this team?
*  Why did we do this? But it was the gateway to the KG trade. I always thought that was like the best
*  gateway trade. This is probably will not have the same results as that, but this is a trade now where
*  you have Brunson, you have Ananobe who's a three, not a two, but now a Mitchell trade makes more sense
*  or somebody like that because they kept all their picks. They still have the Fournier expiring,
*  which is like almost 19 million. They still have the Mitchell Robinson. It sucks to trade a guy
*  who's hurt, but he's still making 16 a year and you could package basically any combination of
*  anything now for a guy making 40 and all your picks and really make a move. And they're a
*  little closer than they were, I think 24 hours ago is my takeaway. Yeah. That's why I like it
*  for the Knicks. If only because RJ always felt like a placeholder for the player that was
*  ultimately going to fill that role. He has done an admiral job of forcing whatever he was,
*  whatever star potential he had into a box to become a role player. He's really excelled
*  better than I ever expected of being an ancillary option for the Knicks. And I'm curious to see how
*  he's going to evolve on that with the Raptors. I think it makes sense that he doesn't really
*  shoot threes that well. And so in that sense, it makes him a perfect Raptor, but he always just
*  seemed a little out of sorts for that Knicks team. And so I do feel like maybe giving him some more
*  space to roam with the Raptors where they can rip and run might actually lead him to something that
*  is going to be. But honestly, I don't know what his future holds. And if it is going to be at
*  this level, that contract is pretty arduous because it's going to go on for another two,
*  three seasons after this. Rob, did you notice what Justin just did there? It was very nice and
*  diplomatic, but he called RJ a good stats, bad team guy. He didn't say it, but he did it for 90
*  seconds. But you're basically you're saying, I want to see this guy on bad teams. Yeah. I mean,
*  he's actually a good, he's like a decent stats, good team guy, I guess would be the evolution of
*  that. Oh, yeah. Maybe that's the ceiling. Decent stats, good team guy. I mean, the precious piece
*  of this, I don't know if it should be in the first 15 minutes of this podcast, but I don't want to
*  sleep on that because we've seen Tibbs hang on to Taj Gibson here like a binky blanket for 15 years.
*  And precious is, I mean, Rob, don't you think precious on this Knicks team is just an immediate,
*  we're going to be watching a week from now. Like, oh my God, this is like the perfect Tibbs guy.
*  Jesus. Okay. I kind of want the isolated Tibbs cam during every precious to chew a minute because
*  he is definitely the kind of player who will make a coach pull their hair out. And yet, because like
*  the Knicks are playing Taj Gibson as their backup center right now, you almost have to play him.
*  Like he has to be a meaningful part of this team. And I'm kind of curious to see how the benches
*  for both of these teams play out now. Cause New York's bench had been pretty solid for them,
*  solid to the point that they started kind of messing with their starting lineup. You know,
*  Dante DiVincenzo goes in there. Josh Hart closes in place of RJ Barrett, as you were alluding to,
*  Bill, like they've had all these options because of their bench, but now everything's a little
*  more shallow. Now everything's a little more reliant on the precious to chew us to make
*  everything go and make everything work. That kind of suits Tibbs in some ways,
*  cause he only wants to play seven guys in the first place, but precious is now essential personnel
*  for the New York Knicks. And I don't feel great about that, but here we are.
*  Do you think biggest loser surgically repaired OJ Ananobi's knee being on a Tibbs team?
*  Although I guess he played for Nick Nurse, who was like kind of Tibbs 2.0 with running
*  guys into the ground. So maybe he's used to it. Maybe the biggest winner though, because whatever
*  wink, wink, nudge, nudge deal OJ Ananobi is probably getting to remain a member of the
*  New York Knicks is probably good for a guy with a surgically repaired knee.
*  Yeah, I do love that Mitchell Robinson's injury has sent Tibbs into this existential crisis where
*  he's reaching back to his old life with Taj Gibson. He just needs a center in this deal,
*  because God forbid, if he ever plays small ball and like tries to do things that are a little bit
*  more inventive, this guy has to play big and physical no matter what. It's just like, it's so
*  perfect. Where was Joe Keefe Noah? He's got to be like, what am I chopped liver? I can't get proper.
*  I wouldn't know any question I had for you guys. Yeah. Could they have done better than this?
*  If Messiah had called us and said, Hey, I'm going to trade in an OB this weekend. I always thought,
*  and I don't know where Indiana is, and maybe they're kind of in no man's land trying to figure
*  out are we buyers or sellers, but I always thought if they wanted to put Matheran on the table with
*  Jairus Walker, something like that, or Philly, if Philly wanted to, I guess, just put a bunch of
*  picks in, who knows? Darrell's probably going to play until February, but I just, I'm surprised
*  that this was the best deal, but at the same time, I really do like quickly. And I think for what
*  this Toronto team needed, especially watching them last night and the other times I've watched them,
*  it just feels like the last five minutes of the game, even dating back to the van Vliet era,
*  the last couple of years, they just never had closers. They would always, any close game,
*  you just always felt like they were going to come up short. So I get the seduction with quickly,
*  but it is kind of crazy that we were talking three first round picks and an asset for him a year ago.
*  This does feel less than what we thought. Some of that might be the difference in that timing,
*  where yes, you could get more a year or two ago, but now staring down an expiring contract for
*  OGN and OB where a player like that is going to have an incredible market. There's going to be
*  a lot of interest in teams. And yeah, I think it does come down to what the Raptors wanted. And
*  this is a team that as much as possible has tried to stave off rebuilds going back to the end of the
*  Rudy Gay era. They have not wanted to bottom out for a variety of reasons. And so maybe they were
*  just staring down those first round picks and saying, honestly, we'd rather have young talent.
*  We'd rather have guys who can step in, especially once they got Barnes and be a part of something
*  that's growing as to whether that's growing in the immediate. I think they're better positioned,
*  they're better. The structure of this team feels better than it did a day ago. I don't know if the
*  Raptors are going to be a great team this season or a dramatically better team this season, but
*  they don't have to be dramatically better to make a run at the final few play-in spots either.
*  There's ground here for the taking for them. So C. Ockham has to be the next trade then.
*  Like I don't see how he makes sense at this point. Yeah, especially with RJ in there. Yeah.
*  I felt like he hasn't made sense there for the last two or three seasons and we've been here.
*  So at this point, nothing will surprise me, but I would hope this is the first domino to fall.
*  Rob, how do you feel just in your head about a spacing with RJ Barrett and C. Ockham?
*  How's that? What kind of defenses are we throwing at a team with two of those five guys out there?
*  Don't forget Yaka Pertle, another important part of their spacing.
*  Yeah. Oh my God. This is like the anti-spacing team.
*  Schroeder's good. But look, just having quickly, plus Gary Trent Jr. shooting has turned a little
*  bit, plus Scotty Barnes has been hitting threes well this season. I mean, that might be the best
*  shooting Raptors team in years at this point. So yeah. Fair. Onward and upward for Toronto.
*  Well, maybe that's why they targeted players over Picks here. I wonder if Scotty Barnes at
*  this point is just too good in order to bottom out and that you'll always be in the 10 to
*  12 range with this team that actually trying to play for Picks isn't really the way to go there.
*  Well, hold on. On that point, don't they have San Antonio gets their top six protected first, right?
*  From the first. So you either have to crater or be a little bit better where you don't want us to
*  give them the seventh pick in the draft. That would suck. Right. True. Right.
*  So I don't know. I also wonder, are we overvaluing first round picks at this point? We're coming off
*  an era where they're like, everyone is going for five to six first round picks. And you look at the
*  teams that have been accumulating them and what have they actually done with any of these? Look
*  at Oklahoma City. They have drafted so well with virtually like 10% of the draft hall that they have
*  that what are they going to do with all these guys that are piling up behind them? I wonder if it
*  actually makes sense. And we're getting into an era where like actually going for younger distressed
*  assets is actually the better thing. And that's why to me, the most interesting part of this trade
*  is that like, this is kind of a Messiah challenge trade to himself. Like he's kind of been missing
*  over the past couple of years, holding on to guys for too long. I wonder if actually finding
*  something and quickly and Barrett might rehab his own value as a GM here, because like those are the
*  type of guys that I think might be undervalued and might be the market inefficiency right now.
*  Yeah. Even if they had gotten three first back for OG at this stage, that still puts them, what, third,
*  maybe fourth in terms of acquired draft capital. If some big trade came available,
*  the Thunder are ahead of them in line. The Jazz are ahead of them in line. I think the Pelicans
*  are probably still ahead of them in line with their assets. And so what do three first really
*  get you unless any of those individual picks is going to get you straight up at the top of the
*  lottery? If they're just kind of mid to late firsts, that kind of capital doesn't go very far right now.
*  I would see as you were talking, I was thinking biggest loser of not getting in an OB. And I think
*  we all think in an OB is a good player, but I don't think he's, I don't think he's a $40 million guy.
*  I don't think he's like special, but I think he's a really good three and D guy. But watching OKC
*  beat the living fuck out of Denver last night and you think like, all right, how do you improve
*  this team without messing with it? And you have basically the Wigan spot. There's a couple,
*  they're seventh, eighth, ninth guys. If you could just put an awesome guy and give that awesome guy
*  their 30 minutes, an awesome fourth, fifth, sixth guy, instead of some of their bench guys,
*  that would have been a really interesting in an OB spot. Just like throw him on that team without
*  them, just with a bunch of picks. But as you said, Justin, it doesn't seem like Masai wanted picks.
*  He wanted players, which was one of the cool things about this trade. It was like an old school
*  basketball trade, two for two, the Detroit second round picks and asset. But for the most part,
*  it's like, eh, not sure about our two guys here. What about those two guys? You're not sure. And
*  we're just swapping. Two for two. The Malachi Flynn erasure happening on this podcast is
*  unacceptable. I didn't even know he was in the trade until Justin mentioned it. But yeah, sorry,
*  sorry, Malachi. Well, you're talking about losers. I think Philly probably has to be up there too,
*  because not only are you taking him off the market, probably because I assume the Knicks are going to
*  sign OG to a big extension this summer, but you're keeping him away from the Sixers who
*  probably need him more than they need Zach Levine or Donovan Mitchell. They don't need star power.
*  They need ancillary star role players. And OG is the best one of those that we have in the league.
*  Yeah. We're in a weird place with the trade market right now where there are kind of,
*  if not a surplus of guys on the market yet, a surplus of guys who plausibly could be,
*  who are more ball dominant guards or scoring oriented guards. And most of the teams that are
*  up there in the standings right now that are really contending, I mean, their scoring is
*  accounted for. They're looking for perimeter defense. They're looking for size and flexibility
*  and switchability. They're looking for a guy like OG who on the right night in the right matchup,
*  he's guarding opposing centers, right? Like that's the kind of optionality he gives you. And so
*  for a player like that to be taken off the market when now we're just looking around at the Levines
*  and the Mitchells, a lot of sameness, I think that's a tough blow for a lot of contenders and
*  would be contenders under these circumstances. Well, and you think with the Knicks too,
*  who do you have to be at knees? You have to be Boston, who's 16 and 0 at home. I'm going to say
*  it again. But you got to go through Boston and you got to be able to defend Tatum and you got
*  to be able to defend Brown. You got to be able to defend Giannis. And you have to be able to defend
*  Giannis and Pat Conaton. And you have to be able to defend Jimmy Butler. And it's just always good
*  to have one guy who can do that and potentially opens the door for them for two. I was looking at,
*  to me, there has to be another Knicks trade because you got to replace to quickly punch off
*  the bench. Even if it's like TJ McConnell, who I continue to throw in a trade, so I continue to
*  like, but just say, Hey, TJ, can you just for eight minutes a half, like run the offense for us when
*  Brunson's not playing even that, you know, could he be 70% of what quickly was? I like where they're
*  at, but I still don't feel like from a firepower standpoint, there has to be a monster trade coming.
*  And it's, you know, Mitchell is the guy we're all staring at. Does he go to Miami? Does he go to
*  Brooklyn? Does he go to the next? Is there some mystery team we don't know about, but it's finding
*  hard to believe Cleveland's going to keep Mitchell and wait till the summer. He's going to have more
*  value in January and February, I think. Don't you? So potential TJ McConnell, Josh Hart,
*  Isaiah Hardenstein. Yeah, that's a feisty team. Is this too much of every dad's favorite player
*  on one team? I guess is my question. It's a feisty fist pump team. A lot of slapping
*  floorboards going on. That's for sure. Justin TJ McConnell could have gotten to Villanova. He
*  would have been totally happy. Oh yeah. Perfect fit there right next to Dante DiVincenzo. Yeah. I mean,
*  do we think that Mitchell is the fit here on the one hand? I personally don't, but I'm not against
*  it. Yeah. I don't love him and Brunson together. I know Rob doesn't either, but if you're going to
*  go all in on somebody, there's not that many somebodies. You made me do yet another ringer
*  top hundred list and I'm going through it and you do those top 30 guys and just none of them are
*  available. And if you're going to trade everything for a top 30 guy, even Towns isn't available at
*  this point. So who's the guy? Yeah, that's the thing. And that's why I kind of don't think this
*  has to be a move made this season. The big salary that would be outgoing in a potential deal is
*  Julius Randall. He's got another year under contract, another year to work with. Maybe this
*  is the kind of thing where you get this together for now. You get OGN and OB comfortable. You figure
*  out what your starting five looks like. And then you're playing a longer game with the trade market
*  as the Knicks always are, honestly. But there is that glaring hole at the two where DiVincenzo
*  is so up and down, so streaky as a player. His decision making offensively can really be pretty
*  infuriating sometimes, but the effort is there. He'll get like have games where he just gets four
*  offensive rebounds that change a quarter. He has those performances in him, but I don't know that
*  you want him as a starter. And it's pretty clear at this point that Tibbs doesn't want Quinton
*  Grimes as the starter either. So if you're not plugging Josh Harden there, I don't know who the
*  long-term answer is. So whether it's Donovan Mitchell, whether it's Zach Levine, whether it's
*  a player to be named later, there is an opening there for sure. Zach Levine. The name has been
*  dropped. Well, let me ask you guys this question, because it's something I've been considering.
*  I love Jalen Brunson. As we mentioned, he's gotten even better this year. It seems like the Knicks
*  fans really love him. It seems like he's a Knicks player. He has that sort of like grinded out spirit
*  to him. Are we sure this guy is going to be on the final edition of the Knicks when they hit their
*  nirvana and they get that big star player? Are we sure that this guy is a keeper long-term?
*  Becky Hammond has entered the chat. Can we believe in short kings in this era?
*  Yeah. I think the important thing is that he's not the king. He's a king among kings. He's like one
*  of your best players, but maybe not your definitively best player. And that is what handicaps the Knicks
*  right now. And that's okay. It's okay that he's just one of the 20 or so best guys in the league
*  and amazing offensively and improving. I don't see why there's anything wrong with that. And
*  this is a team that given its talent base does overachieve. Isn't that what we appreciate and
*  love about the Knicks is that they grind out games. They probably shouldn't win, that they
*  beat some more talented teams. They probably shouldn't beat. That's an admirable thing.
*  The issue for them, because you mentioned maybe this is in the year where they make another move.
*  I actually think that Fournier contract at 18.6, which is expiring with the way their contracts
*  are going to work in general. And if they pay OG and Noby and they're paying Randall and they're
*  paying Brunson, they're just not going to have flexibility to add another bigger piece. So they
*  kind of have to move that deal for somebody by February. And whether that's just a smaller
*  move like Jordan Clarkson, or you got Terry Rogier is another guy I think would be really
*  good for them and potentially could even play some crunch time or some play next to Brunson.
*  But I think they have to parlay Fournier into something. Justin raised a point before we started
*  the pod rub. Now that in and OBI has been traded, who is our new trade machine go to guy? Oh my
*  gosh. Who's going to be the 2023, 24 trade machine MVP because they know be unfundled before this
*  trade was like minus 400 to win the MVP. And I don't think Zach Levine, I, you know, there's
*  been action on him, but I just don't, I'm not buying it. Is it the Jean-Tay Murray? I feel like
*  he's kind of locked down the favorite spot, right? Dejante Murray is a great one because from a
*  distance, a lot of fan bases will think that he's still playing good defense and they'll talk
*  themselves into him being a great addition for their team without realizing that that ship has
*  sailed maybe several seasons ago. Has it sailed or is he unhappy? Cause that's a tough one to figure
*  out because he's on a weird team. He's stored it in another, in another doc. It's at a distant pier
*  you have to drive to now to access. But that's a perfect one. Cause yeah, Levine, I think there's
*  going to be a lot of people as we're trade machining who will talk themselves out of Zach
*  Levine, just on principle. He's just not the kind of player that some teams need. He's not to
*  everyone's taste based on his shot selection, based on his style of play. Or if you want to win,
*  win games and be in the playoffs, maybe over things like that. But sure. I take your point.
*  But Dejante Murray is the archetype of a player that I think is more broadly appealing in the same
*  way that OG is. Well, is the answer right in front of us where Pascal Siakam has to be in
*  the conversation at the very least. He's on the ballot if he's not at the top of it at this point.
*  Oh, FanDuel. I just saw some odd shooting up for Draymond Green. You could have had him at 50 to 1
*  yesterday. He's now 35 to 1. I'm not sure what's going on here. That's a good one. This is a good
*  breakout for us though. For top 100, this is a good breakout for us. Top 10 trade machine guys,
*  just like a little, little offshoot, some side blurbs. I think that could do good numbers for us.
*  So we think Siakam's one or you think it's Dejante Murray? I would say Murray one, maybe Siakam two.
*  In the spirit of a fluid list, Dejante is one, but he's probably going to drop. Siakam is a,
*  he's rocking steady. He's always going to be top three until he gets eventually moved or
*  signs elsewhere. Murray is very in right now. Jeremy Grant's in there. Brogdon. Is Jared Allen
*  on that list for you? Because he is for me. He's on the trade machine list where you don't actually
*  want to trade him, but you feel like you have to. Nobody wants to make Jared Allen trades.
*  It's just like, oh, I need to send her Jared Allen. He makes a lot of money and seems out of
*  place. First of all, speak for yourself because I don't think I haven't tried 17 Jared Allen to
*  OKC trades. Oh, I've tried to trade him everywhere too, but I'm reluctant to do it. He seems like a
*  good hang. He's a great vibes guy. He's a good player, but Cleveland needs some kind of shift,
*  some kind of answer. And he is the easiest answer to provide for by trading Jared Allen here and
*  there. But who exactly needs an extra like pretty traditional center these days? It's a, it's a tough
*  market. If Presti gets really serious, it's going to be like the Scorsese movie when like the gimme
*  shelter starts playing. You're like, Oh, what's going on? Are we about to have a montage? And then
*  all of a sudden he just starts grabbing. It's like, Oh my God, he traded for Jared Allen. My God,
*  they got Jordan Clarkson. And he just starts cashing in those picks because I think he should.
*  I, as you know, I am a big, your window is your window. Don't try to think it's going to be 12
*  years long. Shea's one of the best players in the world. He's fucking kicking ass night after night
*  now. And he's staring down the best dudes in the league and he's outplaying them more than 50% of
*  the time. This team with the way Chet's playing, they have an obligation to go try to chase the
*  title. I don't even think it's an argument anymore. Cash in the fucking picks, go for the title.
*  That's the thing about the Jared Allen type trades though, is that Shea is one of the best players
*  in the world. Chet Holmgren is also one of the best players in the world. And I want him playing
*  as much five as he can handle short term and long term. So you need, you need a, you need some sort
*  of luxury security with that in the playoff series. Yes. You're asking a lot from a second year guy
*  he's going to have to play against Anthony Davis in a series potentially and Jokic, a Go-Ber Towns
*  combo. Like they just don't have enough size yet. So whether it's Jared Allen, whether it's Pertle,
*  like they got to get somebody. Don't you think, who else am I missing Justin? They got to get some big
*  body. I think the scary thing with OKC is I wonder if they don't need to make any move because they
*  could just use this postseason. Yeah. I just think that they could use this postseason as almost like
*  a test case to see what they actually have with some of these guys in postseason basketball.
*  And it's just like, I watched the game like you guys did against the nuggets and it seemed like
*  their style contrast might actually force certain teams to be out of sorts. Like I want to see OKC
*  against a team like the Timberwolves who was going to play big and has to play big, be able to keep
*  up with the offensive firepower. We saw it. Minnesota was, they were really struggling with that.
*  They just spread them out and attack them. And yeah, you're right. I, I still think they could
*  those seven, eight, nine spots though. At least they could, maybe you do a hybrid model of both
*  of those and add one or two kind of lower level guys. I don't know. And they do have so many picks
*  too, where it's not like they have to cash in the whole hall. It could just be a couple of firsts,
*  a couple of swaps in addition to a rotation player. And that can get you a meaningful upgrade,
*  you know, a more veteran player swapping in for one of these other spots, but they have so much
*  young talent. They have so many guys who seem ready. I understand the reluctance, but yet
*  they're going to have to spend these picks on somebody at some point. The shades, the shade
*  stuff is just ludicrous now. Like I was looking up different advanced stats and I mean, he doesn't
*  have a slew of post-ups, but he has enough to at least qualify. And he was like the second best
*  post-up player in the league on top of like all the other crazy shade stats. He just gets whatever
*  shot he wants. Everyone's on a yo-yo and I would love to see them do stuff. I mean, I don't think
*  they were expecting like this version. I was probably one of the few people that was really
*  like, I think this could be a 50-win team, but nobody saw the Chet piece of this unfolding like
*  it's unfolding. I mean, Chet's like, not only is he one of the most efficient big men in the league,
*  but he's completely unafraid at the end of these games. And I just would, I would have thought this
*  would have been the year four version of him, not rookie year. It's nuts.
*  This is how I know this is a proper group chat episode is we end up spending half our time
*  talking about the thunder one way or another. This is who we are here.
*  Well, Justin, can we do a bit of, cause Woz isn't here and I'm in Woz's spot. Can we all take a swing
*  on what Woz's reaction to this trade would have been? Cause he's not even awake yet. It's not even
*  noon on the Pacific time. So he's still asleep. He doesn't know the trade happened.
*  He definitely would have found at least 10 to 20 minutes to take a swipe at Scotty Barnes and say,
*  like, this guy actually isn't a superstar. Why are they building around him? That would have been
*  part of it. He also would have made the point about trading draft picks that we were talking
*  about before, because Woz, if there's anything he hates more than Scotty Barnes is GMs that load up
*  on draft picks. What else am I missing, Rob? I mean, there definitely would have been a huge
*  Julius Randall side swipe in the middle and the how OG is not going to get any shots. Even if
*  he thinks he's going to get more opportunity in New York. I'm trying to think of what Woz's
*  personality diagnosis of OG and Inobi would be. I feel like I should know better by now, but we
*  might need to go straight to the source on that one. If he's really a New York kind of guy is my
*  ultimate question. I need Woz's answer on. I think there's a zag. I don't want to make it
*  cause I like quickly, but there is a zag for somebody with quickly where it's like, oh cool.
*  You're beating up the benches on all these different teams, putting up big stats, but
*  what's it going to be like now that you have to play 35 minutes a game? What are your stats going
*  to look like? We're watching this now with Jordan pool in Washington. It's a little different near
*  the guy when defenses are planning against you versus you just get to come in with three minutes
*  left in the first quarter and you get to torch, you know, backup point guard du jour on the other
*  team. I categorically reject, I reject the quickly pool comparison. I cannot,
*  I cannot say it's standing there for somebody. I didn't personally want to do it, but it was a
*  take exercise. Yeah. Quickly. The big thing for him is how bad he was in the playoffs and what the
*  reasons were for that. Like he's borderline on playable. Yeah. So what did that mean? Is that
*  just the spotlight got big? He went from all the Knicks buzz six man of the year. Oh my God,
*  this guy's amazing. He's the best six man guard we've ever had. All that stuff too. We can't play
*  him. And it was in two weeks. Yeah. And that, that would be the flip side of this trade for
*  the Raptors. If you're looking to be pessimistic about it is there are a lot of bets that Messiah
*  is making on some of these guys to be more than they have been getting any sort of shooting and
*  like supplementary supplementary creation next to Scotty Barnes is helpful, but like it's going to
*  take some actual like thinking and strategizing in order to bring something else out of these guys.
*  Toronto has also had that problem where they've tried to install this, this different offense
*  this season. That's a lot more kind of whirling action, handoffs into handoffs into screens.
*  Everyone's getting involved and it's been a lot of possessions that go absolutely nowhere. And you
*  put RJ Barrett in those app actions. You put Emmanuel quickly. He's a very good player,
*  but not someone who has like overwhelming burst and is going to create something out of nothing.
*  You can still see a lot of those possessions going nowhere. You can still see their offense kind of
*  idling, even though these guys are both talented, are both capable. Theoretically, your spacing is
*  going to be a little bit better, but the Raptors still kind of are who they are and they're going
*  to need a big jump from someone like quickly coming in, not only getting his minutes stretched out,
*  but being a different kind of creator a little bit. They need someone who's able to force the
*  issue a little bit more. It would be funny if Messiah did the press conference and was like,
*  I listen, I didn't tell you guys, but I've been gone for three years.
*  Yeah.
*  When we drafted Scotty Barnes, I actually went away and it's other people have been running the
*  team. I came back. I was like, wow, we haven't made a trade. What happened? And then we did it.
*  Big guys that are left in the market, if it's not Mitchell and it's not Murray,
*  it does feel like Portland has just too many guys. And like that Jeremy Grant,
*  that's probably would be sitting there for the Sixers would be my guess is their target. And then
*  there's a Kuzma piece. I personally don't think Kuzma has looked that good this year.
*  And then Roger and then maybe you could, you know, bottom feed a little bit. Like what if the sons
*  get unhappy with Eric Gordon? Could you rent Eric Gordon for four months and give them picks back
*  that then they could flip for somebody else? Who, what are the other guys you would bottom feed on?
*  It's a little tougher now that Memphis is more respectable too. Like that's a team you could see
*  them being some rotation pieces you could maybe pick off.
*  Portland has them, but their best guys are young in ways they probably want to invest in. So yeah,
*  you can get in on the Brogdon market. I mean, the Rob Williams getting hurt changes things a little
*  bit. He could have been one of those guys hypothetically. I don't know, Justin, who are
*  you seeing here? I mean, does this ultimately have to be a Warriors discussion? Yes. Do they
*  hit the eject button? The material change their team? Does Klay Thompson become available and
*  not only as like an expiring contract for certain players, but does a younger team
*  want to bring him in and say like, Hey, can you just rear our young team? Like the Grizzlies,
*  for instance, could use like a steady hand. It might be a little bit of a weird chemistry fit
*  after they would have been barking at each other for seemingly like five years, those two teams.
*  But like, I'm waiting for the Warriors to do something. I think they need to do something.
*  And if they do, I think it changes the market pretty significantly.
*  Yeah. But they don't you think they would do the Chris Paul expiring card and commingle or Wiggins
*  versus like, I just, I honestly don't see them trading clay. I don't think they'll do it. I
*  think they probably should, but they won't. Yeah. It's too tough. When you, when you're up to four
*  titles with, with a Curry and clay, Draymond is the one that I'm watching because it's pretty
*  obvious that he needs to move on to a different team. And I think the fact that they've looked
*  differently and better without him, that doesn't mean nothing. You know, there are four and nine
*  in the last 13 with him. There's a couple of teams that I think could talk themselves into him.
*  And just in general, now that Jackson Davis is looking like a guy who could play 25 minutes
*  a game for them, I could see, I just feel like something's going to happen with them on that
*  front. I still, I'm not as to me, I'm way more worried about the Grizzlies because people are
*  like, they're back here. They come. Well, first of all, they shouldn't have won either of those
*  new Orleans games. They got killed by the Quippers last night and they can't fucking rebound. Like,
*  I think triple J had two rebounds last night and Zubot's had like 20. So, you know, the fact that
*  not having Adams and not having Clark for this whole season, it's fun to have job back and
*  smarts back and their top four are fun. But ultimately like they, I just don't think they're
*  big enough and have enough rebounding to conceivably go through watching them against Quippers last night.
*  They just got smoked. So they would have to go what 34 and 17 now to get to 44 wins with the
*  size that they have. I don't see it, Rob. I think it's less by the numbers and more conceptually,
*  they're better positioned right now than the Warriors probably are. If we're being totally
*  honest about where those two teams are headed and then the Suns are a team that could spiral
*  out of control. The Rockets are a team that could regress just given the youth of the roster and who
*  they're relying on. So it's less about Memphis being so great. They do have some ground to make
*  up, but it's not a ton of ground. And so I could see them making that 10th spot with an
*  underwhelming record if some of these other teams, the bottom falls out. But as far as-
*  Well, so they would have to have Houston, Phoenix or Golden State would be the three teams unless
*  there's some major injury to a star, but Houston, maybe the most likely, just because their road
*  record's bad. Yeah, they seem a little flimsy, but the Phoenix thing, you guys, we could spend
*  five hours on that. I would have no answers for you. Who the fuck knows? I'm pretty concerned
*  about them. Can I zag again here? Yes. I'm kind of okay with it. This is sort of what we expected
*  if those three guys weren't going to be able to play. We talked about it all summer. Yeah,
*  they have injuries, da, da, da, da, da. But when they're on the court together, it looks fine.
*  And in the interim, all of this stuff is just a prelude to that. And I know injury could strike
*  at any moment with these guys. Kevin Durant, certainly not a paragon of health the past couple
*  of years. Bradley Beal, just struggling to stay on the court and not just roll an ankle at this
*  point. But the outline of the team that we all expected to just be supercharged offensively
*  is in there somewhere. And now maybe this is just because I saw them just completely wax the
*  hornets the other night. But I could still see it and I don't know what would take away from it
*  except for another injury. But this is the son's experience. As you're saying, this is what we all
*  expected. They're still really impressive when they're all together. And I'm saying this is what
*  we all expected. They're probably going to be ninth or 10th place in the Western Conference.
*  That is where they are. And that's who they're going to be so long as they're relying on not
*  just those three guys, but Nurkic, but Eric Gordon, but a whole cast of guys with significant
*  injury histories. Yeah, they bet on Beal, which was just nuts. It's just nuts. I just didn't
*  understand that at all. Who plays 50 games a year, Nurkic who's hurt every year and Durant who's had
*  kind of a shocking amount of injuries on his body over the years. But what they're asking for him,
*  I really think that was one of the reasons he started to get unhappy. It wasn't even like all
*  the different stuff they were asking to do on both ends because they were depleted. But
*  probably him just knowing as an athlete, like I probably shouldn't be playing like this at age 35
*  where I have this much of a burden on both ends. But then on top of it, I'm not really in control
*  of the offense as much as I thought I was going to be. I could see the unhappiness thing at the same
*  time. You chose this guy, Durant. This was your pick and they had to trade all this shit for you.
*  With Phoenix, it's interesting because I didn't think they're going to be a top three team in the
*  West. So I'm not surprised they're not doing well. But now it seems like they're doing so poorly.
*  It's kind of amazing. They're 16 and 15. Like nothing went right for this team all year.
*  And the fact that they're 16 and 15 is kind of amazing. It feels like their record should be
*  worse. So I don't know what happens to them. Who would you pick just in between Houston, Phoenix,
*  Lakers, New Orleans, those four teams to drop out of the top 10 if you had to bet on one? Because
*  somebody's got to move for Golden State and Memphis. Houston seems like the easy pick for me.
*  They've had a pretty remarkable start to the season, but you're already starting to see the
*  seams kind of come undone with that team. Yes, Shen Goon has been a revelation. He's the blog
*  all-star. Everybody loves him. Everyone loves the Yokochess kind of whiff to him. But even Fred Van
*  Vliet seems to be grinding away at certain young players. Jalen Green, for instance, hasn't really
*  taken the leap I think we were all expecting to. Other than Shen Goon, is any young player really
*  rising to the fore there? And I think that is the long-term issue if you're talking about the way
*  that they kind of supercharged and upgraded their young shitty team. It's just like, did we trade
*  great for pretty good? And I wonder even this season if that is a high ceiling that they might
*  not reach. I think they traded a shitty team for a much more stable one and one where you can see
*  what the floor is now and that they're building something. And it's not just structurally around
*  Shen Goon. I think Jabari's been pretty good. We haven't seen anything meaningful from
*  Ahmaud Thompson yet. So that's a big upside piece who could come into play for them over the next
*  couple of seasons. I don't have any problem with Houston's longer-term trajectory, but obviously I
*  agree for this season. If you're saying who is more likely to make the play in the Houston Rockets
*  led by Alpern Shen Goon or the Lakers led by LeBron James, even though a lot of the big picture
*  indicators would tell you the Rockets have been a better team to date, how do you bet against
*  players like LeBron? Even if you're comparing the Rockets to Kevin Durant and Devin Booker and
*  more established players like that, it's just a harder sell admittedly.
*  I have the Lakers and the Warriors to me are going to be in the play in the at least the play in,
*  but they're going to be in the top 10. The Warriors, there's just they have too much talent.
*  They still have a top seven guy and things would have to go really, really wrong. I'm with you
*  probably Houston. I got to say I wouldn't the Dallas piece where Dallas is getting this insane
*  Luka year and they're only 18 and 14. I know Kyrie's missed some games, but they're so
*  Luka dependent. It's one of those things where if he like strains a calf for two weeks, that that
*  team's going to go one and eight those nine games. I don't see it with Memphis. I just don't think
*  I don't think they have enough to get there, which brings us back to the trade part where
*  they don't have enough to get there. Do they do guys like Conchard and some of their role guys
*  become a little more interesting on the on the old open market? Yeah, Memphis could be kind of on
*  either side of the trade and like the trade market and spectrum, right? They could be buyers or
*  sellers conceivably just given everything they have to work with. The team were kind of jumping
*  around in the standings is another trade one to watch the Utah Jazz. I don't really see them going
*  anywhere. You could see a contender plucking off a Kelly Olinic, for example. You could see them
*  plucking off like John Collins has not had a great season, but maybe someone can talk themselves
*  into him or Colin Sexton. Poor John Collins. He's back in the trade machine straight back. I just
*  left another four years. Do you think the nets could be a trade team? I mean, they're already
*  basically guys during random regular season games. Like maybe maybe some of those guys are gettable
*  for teams that are above them in the standings. Well, one thing for them is they have that Ben
*  Simmons contract, which is somehow still has another year left after this, but it is a giant
*  contract that you can put into any trade and take other teams back contracts back if you get the
*  player you want. Yeah. I mean, we didn't mention Bogdanovich on Detroit. Well, you can't trade for
*  him. We all know that. Well, you know, the hardest I think I saw and I try to watch every South the
*  game. I've probably seen 85% of the season. The hardest I've ever seen a team play against them
*  in Boston was that Pistons team the other night. Like they went all, I was actually really impressed.
*  It was a really noble loss by them, but Bogdanovich is good. Like he's, you know, he's somebody
*  offensively that you could go to at the end of games. Who's crafting and can create shots. And
*  I really wanted them to win. Cause as you know, I really care about this home streak
*  and I was scared of Bogdanovich and it's just that guy makes 20 million a year and could be
*  somebody on one of these playoff teams we're talking about. That's probably,
*  that's really the only one I think on the other than Isaiah Stewart, who I think is another blog
*  guy MVP. I think everybody loves Isaiah Stewart, pretty cheap contract. He's got a poison pill
*  thing, but for a team like OKC that to me, he's the perfect OKC guy. Like if they could get him,
*  unbelievable. In order to trade for any of the Pistons guys, you just have to be so sure
*  that their fit with you is better than the fit with the Pistons because there is that thing where
*  it's like, if they were this valuable, if they were this good, wouldn't the Pistons have won a
*  single game in the last three months? So you have to kind of work around those kinds of things,
*  logically speaking. But yeah, Boyan's been the kind of player who could benefit a lot of teams
*  for a long time. And honestly, to kind of, to kind of close the loop on this conversation,
*  the kind of like a weird offensive blueprint for what you would want OG Ananobe to be, right? Like
*  not just a guy who catches in the corner, but who can catch and attack, who can catch and move,
*  who can catch and pass and make the next play. And we've been waiting for that stuff from OG
*  for a long time. He's flashed some of it. It seems like the things he wants to do are not
*  necessarily the things that are contributive to help healthy offense sometimes, but he's so
*  talented. He's so athletic. He's so big. Like the bones are there of someone who could be a more
*  interesting offensive player. If the Pistons trade anyone from this team, do you think like the,
*  like the entire calendula family just descends upon Detroit and just like starts filling in roles
*  here? Like how are the Pistons going to trade off in the NBA? Be okay with that.
*  It's a great question. You were, you were talking about Ananobe.
*  He's year seven. You kind of are who you are. Like we've all been working with
*  Woz for a while. Woz wasn't going to be up at 10 o'clock for the, for the OG Ananobe got traded
*  call. He's just, he's still be asleep with his notifications off. OG Ananobe, it's year seven.
*  You are who you are. You're going to get steals and blocks. You're going to be a really good
*  defensive player. You're going to make open threes, but do I want, do I want to ISO you on the right
*  side with four minutes left and have you try to beat somebody? No, I don't, but I like them.
*  What's the salary for him, Justin? Is he, is it 120 for four? Do you go higher than that?
*  It's a pretty depressed free agent market and you got a lot of teams with cap space too.
*  That's the problem. I just think there's only takes one or two guys and then all of a sudden
*  this guy is making his max. And I think you probably have to trade with him assuming that
*  you're going to have to overpay to keep him otherwise. Wink, wink it. Why do this? Yeah.
*  I guess the Rose family might have a discussion or two over the holidays that where they could
*  maybe not talk about this or pretend that they talked about it. So I could see it.
*  Well, that's how Hartenstein is a max guy, right? Like is he, no questions. He just max them out.
*  Is it like, what is it? 250 for five? Yeah. 120 for one 20 for OG. I'm, I'm taking the over on
*  that. I think he's going to make more. I don't know that I feel good about it, but RJ just made
*  he's do what? 107 or so 108 or so over four years. I think OG is going to kind of shoot that market
*  by a pretty wide margin. Do you guys buy the theory that when the fans of a certain team
*  seem to be aligned on a guy, they're watching every day one way or the other that that has
*  real stakes for you. Cause I find that I do trust that with people that I know are actually watching.
*  And like I said earlier, all my Knicks fan friends were kind of like,
*  RJ, like they were pretty disgruntled. And then you would have a moment where you'd have,
*  you'd have, you'd have those stretches where you'd have like a good, like 10 days and they'd be like,
*  RJ it's happening. And then it would kind of fade off again. I, I don't know a Knicks fan who's
*  like, Oh my God, I can't believe we gave up RJ. I think you're describing how QAnon took off.
*  It's just like group thing is not always the best thing. The origin story of QAnon was a bunch of
*  people on a sub Reddit being very angry about Dwight Powell together. And then that led to
*  everything. That led to pizza gate. That led to the whole, the whole reel of things. So I think
*  we'd be very careful about this kind of radicalization bill. I do feel like people watch the same players
*  day in and day out, like Prichard, who is somebody I think the Celtics might actually potentially
*  trade by February. And I like Prichard. There's teams with length that he becomes, it just is a
*  problem for him when you, when he's playing one of those teams, that's just long everywhere.
*  It's really hard for him to get a shot off, to get his stuff off in traffic,
*  but he's also, he's, he's such a smart offensive player for what his skill set is. Like he figures
*  out how to do it, but I just, there's certain teams in the playoffs that I think he's going
*  to be a liability for them. And I wonder if they see it. And you can't switch with him on defense
*  and smarter teams, target him like that goal and state game was instructive or they kept Torford
*  out there. And it was like minutes 31 through 40. Really they should have brought in Prichard
*  and gone a little smaller and just tried to switch, but they couldn't do it with Prichard.
*  So that's something like, I just feel that way. Cause I've watched all of Prichard's career and
*  I don't know if that shows up in the stats, but I also might've seen too much of them. That's the,
*  the flip side of this is when you're watching the same guys over and over again, you start picking
*  things apart and kind of going glass half empty. Yeah. That's where the intimacy, obviously of
*  watching someone repeatedly and seeing the whole arc of their career, you see them against different
*  kinds of matchups. You see them in different roles. That's all really helpful. I think with
*  fanbases where it gets tricky is when you're talking about just the players and how did they
*  play in this game, the seventh and eighth guys on those teams just get roasted for their weaknesses.
*  And then when it comes time for us to make up some fake trades and we're trying to put the seventh
*  or eighth, the best player in a deal. It's like, we couldn't possibly part with that guy. He's,
*  he's too essential to the infrastructure of our team. So it's almost like the context
*  of how they're talking about them is as important as how they actually feel about them.
*  So Justin, who won the 2019 draft then? Because RJ just got traded.
*  Josh is coming off a 25 game suspension and Zion is, is created the first ever basketball
*  reference page where your stats get worse every year all over the place.
*  And he's getting like off centered giant crosses tattooed to his body. I don't know if you guys
*  saw that. It was a tough one. We're like, man, that guy should not be taking shirtless photos
*  right now. Cause all I saw was like how much extra holiday is good advice. He probably
*  All right, relax again, relax. But I mean like, Ja is definitively the best player or the most
*  productive player out of all of these. And I still take, even though he, he has some interesting
*  choices with his career and his lifestyle. I still think you take the bet on Ja that he could figure
*  that out rather than Zion who needs to be motivated and RJ who let's just be frank. He's just okay.
*  He's pretty good. He's never going to be great. Yeah. He's a distant number three,
*  not exactly a hitters team behind those guys though. You know, your Deandre hunters,
*  you know, your Jared Culver's, your Jackson, Garland Garland's good. And Hey,
*  Kobe white Lafayette Blanca as we know him, Justin off, off to a hell of a start this
*  season or really a hell of a resurgence this season. So there's, there's some players to like
*  and more on the role player into the spectrum. Some guys still like, but at the top it's tough
*  when even the best, most talented prospects, the guys who were supposed to be not just
*  franchise changers, but league changers have had such huge questions around them. And then
*  RJ is just kind of shuffling around in relative anonymity in the biggest market in the world.
*  And now back, back on home turf, a native son returned to Canada, returned to Toronto or,
*  you know, I love it. Would you rather have Kobe white or RJ Barrett?
*  I think I'd rather have Kobe white. I think so too now. Yeah. What is our level of confidence
*  that Kobe white is in fact Damien Lillard because it sure seems like it.
*  So you would, if you redrafted this job first,
*  Garland or Zion, Garland has to be ahead of Zion at this point, right? Like if the,
*  if the Pelicans called the calves and said, we'll give you, we'll give you Zion for Garland right
*  now. No questions asked. I don't think the calves do it. What do we think Garland's ceiling is
*  though? I think higher than what we've seen. Yeah. I just think it's going to be such a liability
*  in the playoffs that like he's the classic example of the type of guy who might be successful and
*  then we'll search you to the second round. Then all of a sudden he's getting picked on.
*  Justin, we're not inviting you to the let dares Garland cook barbecue that we're having in mid
*  January. I know Rob, Rob, you'll be there. You'll bring some barbecue sauce.
*  I'm always in for a Darius Garland barbecue of any kind, but I can't pretend I don't have concerns.
*  I can't pretend that these New York Knicks didn't put those concerns in my head of just like him
*  feeling so small against those kinds of matchups in the playoffs. Yeah. And that's fair. So would
*  you take Garland or Zion? I would take Zion. I would too. I think too much upside. I think I'd
*  take Garland upside. Yeah. Grant Williams was the top 10 guy from that draft.
