# End of an Era Loss for the Warriors? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh4G0F33YU0)
*  So the other piece that Lakers series was that they broke Golden State and I actually
*  thought it was worse than maybe the reporting and stuff afterwards.
*  Although the reporting got a little bit dark and there were some big pieces, but just watching
*  what I saw in person, game four, game six, I said after game four on this podcast, how
*  they looked like coworkers to me and not close to that team anymore.
*  And there's a whole bunch of reasons for that, that we've talked about where the, you know,
*  they have a team on Punches Pool, they have these young guys that all want to play, they
*  have old guys who maybe aren't as good as they think they are anymore, who still think
*  they are and carry themselves that way.
*  A coaching staff that's been there for a while.
*  It's just, there were things I didn't like seeing in game four and I thought they were
*  going to either lose game five or game six, but I didn't think they were going to come
*  back from three one.
*  Game six, it fell apart fast for them and they were kind of hoping for the clay game
*  because he had sucked in game four and game five and he was worse in game six and Curry
*  was the only guy on the team who could create a shot and Curry has to go back to Jordan
*  Pool at some point and hoping that he's going to do something he couldn't do anything.
*  And they were just outmanned and looked pretty broken as a team.
*  And it was really interesting watching Iguodal in the timeout huddles because the coaches
*  do the thing where they all move off to the side.
*  And then it was basically Iguodal and Looney trying to keep everyone together and be like
*  glue guys.
*  And there's this moment in the second half where Pool was just mad.
*  He was mad at everybody and they're trying to calm him down and he was mad at Steve Kerr
*  about something.
*  Steve Kerr got mad because he missed some sort of defensive assignment.
*  He came back and Kaminga got mad that he never came in.
*  There was two guys talking to him, somebody else is talking to Pool and I'm like, oh my
*  God, this is getting dark.
*  This team has real issues.
*  It was like being at a Thanksgiving table where a couple just starts fighting.
*  You're like, oh my God, our cousins, they're just fucking airing it out right in front
*  of us.
*  To me, that team is going to make some, my takeaway is that that team is going to make
*  major changes despite what they said.
*  I don't believe them.
*  I think they have to.
*  And if that change is just trade Pool and trade Kaminga, if it's a little more ambitious
*  and maybe Draymond leaves, I refuse to believe they're going to run it back.
*  That is not a championship team.
*  It's not.
*  You're right about the championship team, and you're in attendance.
*  And, you know, I do think teams that are losing all look like they fucking hate each
*  other towards the end of it.
*  And I felt like...
*  They weren't close last year.
*  They were close last year, though.
*  That was one of the things that made them them last year was they they were all kind
*  of pulling together. That's not what was happening this year.
*  And that was the whole year.
*  That's why they're so bad on the road.
*  I'll say one thing and then I'll ask you a question.
*  Whenever they lost, the Draymond Green punch on Jordan Pool was going to be brought back
*  up as to some death blow.
*  All right. Like the only other version where it wasn't going to be brought up is that they
*  won a back to back title, which wasn't realistic.
*  So, you know, I think it's playing the results a little bit, unless you know for certain
*  that they were all bummed out all year long.
*  And that's why they didn't play as well.
*  Because it's funny, because like Golden State loses in the second round.
*  It's like, you know, we should have seen this coming.
*  Like, OK, we do the same thing with Miami Heat.
*  Should we? We've seen this coming.
*  Like, that doesn't make any sense.
*  You could see it coming after game four, though.
*  Let me. All right. OK, fine.
*  Game four, game four down three.
*  They were bummed out. OK.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  But something dramatic happened to pool this season.
*  And then especially in the playoffs, like he averaged 11 points a game in the playoffs.
*  Right. But if they had lost to Sacramento, it was going to be Draymond punch Jordan
*  pool dot dot dot.
*  They almost did lose to Sacramento.
*  They had the team meeting after game six.
*  Like the athletic wrote that whole piece about how Curry had to give
*  like the first speech he'd ever given to the team in his whole life
*  about how they had to stick together.
*  I think this team had real issues.
*  I'm not saying you're wrong.
*  I mean, I agree with you on the issues part, but I'm just telling you, like
*  the way we tell stories is the Draymond punched a teammate story
*  was going to be used in whatever fashion to be used once this team was eliminated,
*  which was more likely than not that they were going to be eliminated at some point.
*  So the same stories that ran after game six
*  were going to run after game seven if they lost games in Sacramento.
*  And I don't know if that means the entire vibe was off all year.
*  I don't know if it means
*  was could the could the vibe have been off because they knew they weren't as good.
*  It was going to be hard to win a title.
*  Or is it just because Jordan Poole regrets so much or just loves to foul
*  everybody all the time?
*  The reason I bring that all up is I agree with you on a lot of the Golden State stuff.
*  It's just what do you actually think they're going to do?
*  Like how much different do you think they're going to be?
*  Can I greeny tease it for you?
*  Please. Even though we're not going to break.
*  I'm going to tell you the Draymond punch hurt the most.
*  That's next. Then I come back from the break.
*  That Draymond punch, you know, it hurt the most.
*  Draymond Green.
*  I think it affected how he led the team.
*  And, you know, is really interesting about the Laker series.
*  All the Draymond stuff that he does that's great in a playoff series,
*  he wouldn't do to LeBron and Davis.
*  He didn't fuck with LeBron once.
*  Practically made out with him after they lost to him.
*  It was actually like shocking.
*  It was shocking because part of if you have Draymond on your team,
*  it's like, what are the benefits of having Draymond on your team?
*  Incredible defensive player, incredible competitor, pretty good rebounder,
*  great passer.
*  And he seizes on whatever the method is.
*  He seizes on whatever the mental or emotional or whatever weaknesses of the other team.
*  Like he did with the Celtics in that series where he's like,
*  this team isn't tough enough.
*  Fucking bully ball the Celtics, that whole series.
*  Did you try anything with LeBron or Davis, that whole series?
*  No, LeBron. I get it.
*  Like LeBron's his friend.
*  They have the same agent, like all that stuff.
*  Like LeBron's like his big brother in a lot of ways.
*  Davis is exactly the kind of guy, if you were doing a fantasy draft,
*  that people Draymond Green would fuck with.
*  You'd put Davis on it. He didn't mess with him.
*  And so he was kind of running around.
*  He's like trying to start shit with Dennis Schroeder and Darwin Ham.
*  It's like, go pick that.
*  Why don't you start fighting the two guys who are kicking your ass?
*  And I'll tell you, like, I think LeBron befriending that guy was really smart
*  because, you know, down the road, you never know if you're going to play,
*  play against somebody like that.
*  And they're going against them.
*  And Draymond wasn't doing any of the normal Draymond stuff against them.
*  So that's one side.
*  And then the other side is the leadership thing that it's pretty clear that
*  it wasn't the same kind of leadership after that, where he was like a fiery,
*  you know, in everybody's face, like just love the team, all about the team,
*  all about the team.
*  Then he punched somebody.
*  I did think it affected them.
*  I think it affected Poole.
*  Poole was awesome last year.
*  He sucked in the playoffs.
*  He was unplayable.
*  So I don't know.
*  To me, it's like multiple moments.
*  It's how that punch affected Draymond and Poole.
*  It's the fact that Kamingo wanted to play and he would.
*  It's like something happened with Kamingo where Kerr was like, I'm out.
*  He stopped playing them completely.
*  Like you needed Kamingo in the Lakers series.
*  You needed his size and athleticism against Lebron.
*  They didn't even try him.
*  So I don't know.
*  It just felt like an end of an era of loss.
*  And I think these things end badly.
*  Nobody's had like the Pistons in 92.
*  They had lost the Bulls the year before, right?
*  Then they lose to the Knicks in round one.
*  It's like, whoa, this is over.
*  That was my feeling after that Lakers series.
*  To me, it felt like an ending, like we're now moving into a different era with them
*  because I don't think Clay's the same guy anymore.
*  And I don't know what Draymond is at this point.
*  Agree with all of it.
*  I don't know that anyone that ends goodly though.
*  Like it never at the end, if this is truly the end and the better bet is to say,
*  hey, it's over, right?
*  You can't because you're, what is the payroll?
*  You did all the math, the payroll luxury tax stuff with that.
*  That's the thing with this is they have no ads.
*  That's the point that I want to get to is that I actually think they're going to look like the
*  same team next year.
*  So as much as people want to go, oh, this guy should be gone or what are they going to do with
*  Draymond?
*  I mean, look, there are 81 million with Clay and pool Clay to me, if he makes some shots,
*  we don't care about Draymond's punch as much months and months later.
*  I mean, the guy was three for 16 in elimination game.
*  If we're not in a shot and looking like he was out,
*  but when she said Clay's a once a week guy, like what we talked about with Harden,
*  I don't know.
*  He had like back to back months during the regular season.
*  He had the highest scoring months of his career in two of those months.
*  So I thought, okay, at least you, even if he's not, because he's not the same guy was defensively
*  when it felt like he was one of the best two way, that has not been the case.
*  It's not coming back.
*  That part's not coming back.
*  The offense.
*  I thought I didn't think it was going to be, Hey, every single game now, multiple games in a row,
*  every single game is a stretch, but like, look at his shooting numbers, look at the games,
*  look at the games where you go to, he's not even close.
*  And then when he's not hitting shots, it's like, what am I actually getting from him?
*  Cause it's not rebounds.
*  It's not playmaking.
*  It's not that elite level defense.
*  You don't assign them to the best perimeter guys anymore.
*  Cause he's going to get cooked.
*  So that's a big issue.
*  So you wouldn't pay him 43 million?
*  I wouldn't want to, but he's an expiring.
*  So what are you going to do?
*  Go to Steph and say, Hey, we're going to move on from Clay.
*  We're going to break this up to try to reinvent around you.
*  Well, Clay's opting in.
*  Clay has a player option.
*  He's going to opt in.
*  There was some stuff in the reporting about.
*  I'm talking about trades.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they're not going to trade Clay.
*  I don't see that happening.
*  They're going to trade.
*  I think they trade Poole and Kaminga, I think would be the leading contenders.
*  And I would still be interested in both players.
*  You know, I think Kerr, they tried to do something that it's hard enough to rebuild in this league.
*  They tried to rebuild while they were competing for titles.
*  Good luck.
*  It's, it's really hard to do.
*  And, you know, all three lottery guys between Wiseman, Kaminga and Moody,
*  not being even one bankable rotation guy, it really hurt them extending this.
*  Wiseman not having another server so big because Kerr didn't want to play them.
*  And then they don't bring in another big just to back up Looney.
*  Cause you know, if you're looking at mapping out potential playoff matchups,
*  and maybe they didn't map out the Lakers part of it enough, you're like, okay, wait,
*  centers are a little overrated and they can get played off the floor.
*  But do we have 20 other minutes from another center?
*  Are we going to ask Looney to run around the whole time or have Draymond Green defending
*  Yokocho or AD if they were to get through the second round.
*  So you lose DDB who is their second best guy in game six, which is a problem.
*  Yeah. And Wiggins wasn't even close to being the same guy in game six as he was in game five,
*  which is another thing where he's gone. You know, again, they, he was gone.
*  So then it's like, oh, hey, he's back and he's back for the playoffs.
*  Let's ramp this whole thing up again. The numbers are the thing that matters here
*  because Deft's at 52, Clay's at 43, Poole is at 29. Draymond has a player option at 27.5 million.
*  I'm sure they want to resign him despite everything that's happened. So if he were
*  to opt out, does he opt out knowing he's got an extension for the same number about for three
*  years, maybe Wiggins is actually a valuable contract because he's pretty good. He's not great,
*  but he's good. He's at 25 million the next three years. The problem is you keep adding these up.
*  Gary Payton's 9 million, Looney, seven and a half million commingo, where you'd still keep him on
*  the books because you want the asset. Defenchenzo is going to opt out of his players option.
*  They are with the repeater tax. They're 55 million over the tax. All right. But because
*  they're there through the second apron of the triggers, their tax for next year, if they keep
*  all of this together is 250 million, which is more than any other team's payroll. Their tax bill
*  will be that much more. So the question I don't have the answer to is despite how bad it looked
*  here at the end and all the different storylines, which are all valid, I'm not dismissing any of it.
*  I'm simply asking like, I wonder how much that'll impact this team from looking different.
*  Because I don't know how many mechanisms they have to be different. You start moving out assets
*  to trim payroll. Then you're not actually making yourself better. Can you do that? If you're curry
*  will Bob Myers be the guy that wants to walk away from curry was still a few years left of his prime.
*  We would think, and does any owner, even Joe Lake up, go, Hey, a 40 something win team. It cost
*  me 250 million in tax. Yeah. Let's run it back. No owner ever seems to want to do something like
*  that. Cause no owners ever had to before. Well, the other problem with him is he's got a lot of
*  minority owners and the higher that that tax goes and the repeater tax and all that stuff.
*  This isn't Matt Ishby owning 80% of the sons. This is a bunch of minority owners who invest in
*  the team who look at stuff like, wait, we're going to pay $400 million and we lost in game six and
*  round two. I, uh, well, let me ask you this. The lake ups call you FaceTime, not just Joe,
*  but the two sons, the three of them call you. They're like, we're still low. We need your advice.
*  What do you think we should do? If they called me, I think I would tell them to throw away next year
*  and just reboot and get out of whatever next year looks like. Not throw throw away is the wrong
*  word. I would try to get off that pool contract and I would make it very clear to Clay that if
*  he does come back with the warriors, there's just no way you're going to be making anything close to
*  43 million again. So you'd tell us what you want us to do because that money's not going to be
*  there. And I would not pay Draymond any, anything higher than low twenties at this point. Cause I
*  would really, really, to me there, there's like some real Ben Wallace, mid late two thousands
*  potential with him where if, when it goes, those intangible guys, when it goes to them, it goes
*  fast. And I'll be really nervous about that. Cause there's no plan B for him. If his athleticism
*  starts going, you know, and he's played a lot of games over the last 10 years, I would just be
*  nervous about that. Um, and I would think about trading cominga
*  because what am I going to, what am I paying cominga in two years? I don't even know what he
*  is and he's going to be eligible for the rookie extension. Um, like in it, I guess like this summer,
*  but really next summer, I don't know. I, the trade I would be looking for them if I was,
*  if I was them is trying to trade Jordan Poodle team with cap space so I can get a bunch of cap
*  relief and maybe get a player back who's not as good, but is way cheaper. And he gets a fresh
*  start. And by the way, if I was another team, I would be intrigued by Jordan pool. He's a change
*  of scenery guy to me. You know, if it's like the wizards or the spurs or a team like that, the magic
*  he'd make a wizard. The magic aren't touching somebody like that. You're going to stop dumping
*  everybody's problems on the magic. Well, I like to bring them up just to make sure
*  Sarudy is paying attention. There's another thing with them. They're not doing it.
*  Detroit's got cap space. Sarudy says, I actually don't hate it. That was a, just, he's just
*  chat is that there's one more piece I want to mention to you from a basketball standpoint
*  about this team. Cause we saw them get overpowered by Davis and LeBron, right?
*  During their hay day, they never really played it. Did they play a team that could do that
*  during the whole hay day? Right. Cause I was thinking about 2018 when LeBron had that incredible
*  game one. That's the best game I've ever been to LeBron when he just overpowered them physically
*  and then went to OT cause of JR Smith and the doors ended up winning. But just in general,
*  from 2014 on, can you remember a team overpowering them like that? And I wonder like, is the league,
*  there's more centers, there's more physicality, there's more guys who can kind of punish you if
*  you're undersized. And maybe that lineup that they played had a little bit of a shelf life,
*  especially if Draymond's athleticism is starting to fade a tiny bit. Well, the beginning,
*  the beginning, no, cause they had Bogut and I mean, you weren't going to, and then when they
*  didn't have them, they had the best starting five in the history of the game. Right. But,
*  but who's in the league in the mid 2010s that's going to make them pay for it the same way that
*  not Tristan Thompson and Davis together. Yeah. Not Tristan Thompson or Yolkich. Like
*  if they had played Denver, I think Denver would have done the same thing. Right. They,
*  they were going against Dwight Howard. They were going against whoever was on Portland, Nerkage,
*  you know, that Quippers team in 2000, you know, the mid 2010s. I don't, I just don't remember
*  ever being worried about them being physically overpowered until this series.
*  This is the first time I was like, Whoa, they're not big enough, which is never something you said
*  with the Warriors. It was always like, Oh, they'll figure it out. Cause everybody kept missing shots
*  too. Like that's the other part of this math that like I'm with you. It was bad when you're big and
*  tired. I'd rather be big and tired than small and tired because when you're small and tired,
*  you don't get there. But when clay misses all of his shots and pool gets out there to see how many
*  bad files you can commit immediately. And Draymond doesn't look at the rim and then Wiggins is a no
*  show in that last game. Like that's when it is going to look bad. I mean, it's a good point on
*  the center stuff, but they were, they were more armed, you know, they were more armed with,
*  not just the center stuff, the overpowering thing. Cause like what LeBron was doing to them,
*  I don't really know what their answer was. It's something that Celtics couldn't do against them,
*  but it reminded me of in the, the 90s bulls, the one thing if you're going to pick,
*  if you're doing the greatest teams of all time and you're arguing, all right, how would you beat this
*  team? What was their flaw? And we never really saw with the 90s bulls in those six years other than
*  Ewing was a team that could try to basically a team that was big, could try to physically overpower
*  them. What would that look like? Right? Rick Smith's was somebody that had success against him,
*  but the two best Hakim years, those were the years that Jordan was playing baseball or came back.
*  And so we never kind of saw them have to deal with the Hakim type. So it was one of those questions.
*  We just never have an answer for it. And the Warriors for years, it was the same kind of thing.
*  Well, what would happen if they played this type of team? What would it look like?
*  And we kind of found out in this Laker series, I thought LeBron anytime he wanted to get to the rim,
*  anytime.
