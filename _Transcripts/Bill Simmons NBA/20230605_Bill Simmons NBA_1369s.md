# Drafting the Worst NBA GM Jobs Right Now With Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc)
*  All right. So last year at this time, we played a game like literally this month, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=0.0s)]
*  2022, we played a game, worst GM jobs, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=4.04s)]
*  the GM jobs you wouldn't want to have. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=7.4s)]
*  And the parameters were town of the roster, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=10.92s)]
*  salary cap situation. What's your owner like? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=15.36s)]
*  What market are you in? What's your success upside? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=19.88s)]
*  It's a ceiling of the job. So I went back and I listened, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=24.96s)]
*  it was really funny. The order we had in 2022, we just went, we traded picks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=30.04s)]
*  You had the first pick and you took Sacramento. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=34.76s)]
*  You thought that was the worst GM job. And I, by the way, agreed with you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=38.96s)]
*  We just were like, where, where's this team going? And I think at one point, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=43.88s)]
*  one of us said, well, they have the fourth pick, so that's good. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  But for the most part, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=50.44s)]
*  seem pretty grim with not a lot of movement potential. I, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=52.08s)]
*  with my first pick, I took Washington. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=56.08s)]
*  I think I got good value a year later. Still feeling good about that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  You took Phoenix third, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  cause you didn't know what was going on with them long-term, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=63.96s)]
*  what was, how the Chris Paul thing was going to play out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=66.68s)]
*  Obviously now they have the Durand and that's a different situation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=69.88s)]
*  I took the Lakers with my second pick. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=73.28s)]
*  Didn't anticipate Austin Reeves turning into, you know, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=78.12s)]
*  the free agent steel of 2023, potentially. You took Portland. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=82.12s)]
*  I took Utah and we had all conversation about what do you do with Mitchell and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=87.0s)]
*  go bear not realizing they were about to trade them for 200 picks and a couple [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=91.56s)]
*  of future, all NBA guys. You took Philly only if there was a heart and max. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=95.52s)]
*  You're very careful. Like it had their heart and max has to be involved. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=101.24s)]
*  I took Brooklyn and laid out a whole case. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=105.24s)]
*  This is all right. So this is the beginning of June, 2022. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=108.36s)]
*  So it was the core free agency. It happened. Right. Okay. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=112.16s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know what's happening with this Brooklyn team, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  but it feels like they're headed for a cliff. And like three weeks later, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=117.52s)]
*  KDS for trade, then you took Charlotte. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=120.64s)]
*  And then with the 12th and last pick I took Atlanta. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=123.36s)]
*  Not a lot of those teams are going to be left in the worst GM job draft for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=126.88s)]
*  2023. Also a little harder to figure out 12 teams this year, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=131.92s)]
*  because I think, you know, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=135.24s)]
*  like San Antonio if they had gotten the fourth pick instead of the first pick [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=137.04s)]
*  would have been probably the first pick in our draft. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=140.28s)]
*  Now they're not going to get drafted. I'm going to give you the first pick again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=142.48s)]
*  What GM job would you not want heading into the draft and free agency right now? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=146.76s)]
*  Charlotte. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=151.72s)]
*  Charlotte. Yeah. Interesting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  Cause I think, well, one, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  the whole reason Sacramento was the answer last year is cause of a vet. All right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=159.6s)]
*  That was a big part of the conversation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=165.0s)]
*  And then Monty McNair ends up winning executive of the year. So they did a great job. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=167.32s)]
*  It was awesome. You know, good for the Sacramento Kings, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=170.88s)]
*  but I still think the owner part of it's such a big, big factor. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=173.44s)]
*  And even though the Hornets are supposedly going to be sold here, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  the Jordan run has been terrible. We've been over it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  You have some weird basketball decisions that you have to worry about. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=184.4s)]
*  And on top of that, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=188.32s)]
*  you're probably going to max out LaMelo because he's your star. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=189.84s)]
*  He's your, you'll have to do it and you don't want to do it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=194.04s)]
*  So, uh, that would be, that would be my first choice. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  Would you trade Jalen Brown for LaMelo ball? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=203.8s)]
*  No. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=207.32s)]
*  Would you trade Jalen Brown for LaMelo ball and Gordon Hayward is expiring? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=209.08s)]
*  I don't know. Gordon doesn't stay healthy, man. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't do either trade. I'm just, yeah, I was trying to think like, if, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=221.12s)]
*  if Charlotte decided, you know, who's awesome, screwed Anderson, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=224.68s)]
*  let's take that guy number two and we'll trade the Mello. Like what, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=228.32s)]
*  I wonder what they could get for the Mello. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=231.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=235.16s)]
*  With my first pick, this surprised me. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=238.72s)]
*  I'm going to take the Chicago Bulls. Wow. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=242.72s)]
*  Well, I don't know what their move is. They don't have a first round pick this year. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=246.92s)]
*  They lost the Franz Wagner pick. The Rosen's in his mid thirties now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  Uh, I'm not a Zach Levine guy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=255.88s)]
*  Just feel free to put that on my IMDb or wherever you want. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=259.56s)]
*  He's certainly fine. Uh, just not personally, my cup of tea. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=265.08s)]
*  He might be yours, just not for me. Um, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  there's talk about a VUCH extension, which made me super nervous. That was in the, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=273.4s)]
*  uh, the news. I don't know if Patrick Williams is going to be good. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=277.76s)]
*  And I don't really know what the moves are with this team from a roster [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  standpoint. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=285.2s)]
*  There's a lot of other rosters I wanted and a couple of the other teams that I [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=285.76s)]
*  was thinking about, I was like, well, at least they have a top seven, top eight [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  pick. So I'm taking the bulls second. You were surprised by that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But as you talked it out, like they're, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=298.92s)]
*  they're definitely kind of stuck right now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  I just don't want to be a no man's land with the team on taking over. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=304.0s)]
*  And I'm also not convinced that that team ever wants to spend money. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  What was that thing? They've exceeded the luxury tax like once in 15 years, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=310.72s)]
*  something like that. So, um, I have an owner who doesn't love spending money. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=314.68s)]
*  I don't have any first round picks and the Lonzo ball thing was just an all time [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=318.76s)]
*  bad beat. Doesn't seem like he's even coming back. So, all right, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  who do you have? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the Lonzo thing sucks. Uh, this is going to be weird. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  You're going to be surprised I'm taking this team as high as I am. Um, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  but I'm going to take Minnesota. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=337.2s)]
*  I just think. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=340.76s)]
*  Even with our guy Edwards? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=341.6s)]
*  I know even with our favorite player, but you know, go bears is going to be 41, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=342.24s)]
*  44, 47 million. And then Carl Anthony towns who, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=346.24s)]
*  you know, I'm just not a huge fan of 36 and 50, 54, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=351.88s)]
*  58 million player option for 62.0 million. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=356.24s)]
*  Uh, that's in 27, 28, uh, Conley, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=362.24s)]
*  they have to make a decision on his contract. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  So there's some depth stuff there. Um, in look, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=367.72s)]
*  Jayden's been a nice story for them, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=370.86s)]
*  but for him to like be really something you're gonna have to see a little bit [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  more from his offense as well. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=376.22s)]
*  And that's with one of my single favorite players in the league. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  Like if I give you my list of five favorite players in the NBA, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=380.82s)]
*  Anthony Edwards is on that list. So you factor in those two guys, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=383.5s)]
*  you already know this and the draft picks that they moved out. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=387.44s)]
*  I think the scary thing is they're going to have to like, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=389.72s)]
*  we already know Milwaukee's at some point going to have to reinvent this thing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=391.88s)]
*  on the fly with stage two or three of whatever Yonis is. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=394.88s)]
*  I don't even know if Minnesota will be able to do it in a way that helps the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=399.2s)]
*  rest of the roster when they have to kind of figure out who they're going to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=402.24s)]
*  be. Cause I think Edwards will be that good and pretending that he's not the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=404.6s)]
*  number one option as they move forward is probably just a waste of everybody's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=408.56s)]
*  time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=412.0s)]
*  You made me think as you were talking that out, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=413.48s)]
*  does a town's name trade make sense? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=415.48s)]
*  Maybe. And then Portland takes scoot. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=421.28s)]
*  And you put Dame and Edwards together with, with a go bear as a center. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=424.88s)]
*  And you got McDaniels and it's not nothing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=428.8s)]
*  If you're Portland, I'm probably hoping I could get more from Dame. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=436.08s)]
*  Towns is like 27 at this point. I feel like he is what he is, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=440.28s)]
*  but he's still a 25 and 10 when he's healthy. He's still a pretty good player. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=443.24s)]
*  He's still a good player. I just don't trust him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=447.6s)]
*  And I don't know what happens to him in games where I feel like- [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Pressure? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=457.04s)]
*  Yeah. He feels like it might just be the way he is so demonstrative that it, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=458.36s)]
*  that it ends up being worse than it actually is with the basketball stuff. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=463.8s)]
*  But I feel like he lets shit get to him, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  not DeMarcus Cousins way where you'd be like, Oh, he's gone for the game. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=471.0s)]
*  Okay. We'll see you on Tuesday. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=476.24s)]
*  You've got nothing left for tonight. I wouldn't say anything was ever that bad, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  but I look, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  I think there's plenty of evidence to say that those two guys, it just, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know, man, we've been over it. We've talked about it a million times. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=489.2s)]
*  I don't need to keep going over it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm taking the Clippers. No, I'm taking the Clippers next. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=494.36s)]
*  Clippers are on my board, but the ownership deal- [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=498.68s)]
*  Great owner. But the great owner also put us in the position where I have a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=502.12s)]
*  $210 million payroll. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=506.44s)]
*  I have a best player who makes an insane amount of money, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=508.84s)]
*  who keeps getting hurt and then kind of tells you when he's going to play. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=511.88s)]
*  I have no draft picks at all. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=517.48s)]
*  Okay. So he just basically has all my drafts going forward for a couple of years [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=520.24s)]
*  here. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=523.88s)]
*  Paul George is very dangerously heading toward that Blake Griffin. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=524.76s)]
*  When Blake Griffin all of a sudden had had like seven, eight surgeries and you're [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=530.04s)]
*  like, Oh man, that's, that's a lot for one body. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=533.56s)]
*  And then all of a sudden his career went off a cliff. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=537.24s)]
*  I do worry about that with Paul George. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=540.72s)]
*  He's had a lot of injuries to a lot of major body parts. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  And then I don't really know what else I'm supposed to like on this team. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  And I don't know how they have a $209 million payroll. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=548.52s)]
*  So I don't know what the fixes are. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  I think the fact that Tai Liu was out there and about as being available for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=554.68s)]
*  these different coaching jobs when he was under contract for another year was [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=559.6s)]
*  really weird. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=562.84s)]
*  And the Clippers were like, fuck you. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=564.84s)]
*  You're not going anywhere. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=566.24s)]
*  Um, I don't know what the fixes are with this team. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  The salary stuff is like, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=574.36s)]
*  It's kind of jaw dropping the spot track, like pulsates. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=577.76s)]
*  When you look at it, when you do the multi-year contracts, the spot tracks start, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=581.08s)]
*  starts doing like some fucking, you know, like Daniel Craig getting poisoned and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  Casino Royale, like the weird shaky handicam. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=590.0s)]
*  Um, it's pretty brutal. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=593.84s)]
*  And then you've no way to get better. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=595.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=598.32s)]
*  Because the crazy thing is like the numbers on some of the other guys, we were [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=598.48s)]
*  like, okay, so let me go over this again. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=603.52s)]
*  You're like, all right, Terrence man's 10 and a half, 11. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=605.44s)]
*  Zubach is worth 11 million, but he is 11 million. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=609.0s)]
*  Covington's 12 million. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=612.92s)]
*  Batum's another 12 million. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=614.88s)]
*  Fucking Marcus Morris is 17 million. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=617.12s)]
*  17 million for next year. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=620.68s)]
*  Um, you know, you're just stuck. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=623.28s)]
*  You have all these pieces. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=625.76s)]
*  Gordon's not even close to being fully guaranteed, but they'll probably bring them [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=627.28s)]
*  back, you know, and then, of course you have to. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=631.28s)]
*  Why not? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=633.32s)]
*  There might be those Knicks rosters from the early 2000s when they just had so [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=634.16s)]
*  many salaries, there was just, the only way to get out of the mess they were in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=637.92s)]
*  was to trade for more salaries. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=641.6s)]
*  They just kept adding. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=643.6s)]
*  It becomes like a ladder match for a salary cap. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=645.2s)]
*  I don't, I'm laughing so hard because I'll never forget Isaiah going on with Mike [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  and the dog to explain what he was doing. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=653.24s)]
*  And they were like, what are you doing? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=656.84s)]
*  And dog is just like letting them have it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=659.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=661.2s)]
*  And he's going, he's like, well, what you don't realize Chris is when you have an [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  expiring, you can then trade that for somebody else's contract because those [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=666.52s)]
*  expirings are really valuable. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=670.84s)]
*  And then dogs like, yeah, but you keep trading them for like a more [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  egregious contract. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=677.44s)]
*  And then he's like, yeah, but then those become expiring. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=679.76s)]
*  Like he didn't understand it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=682.6s)]
*  Like a Ponzi scheme. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=684.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=685.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=685.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=686.4000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=686.72s)]
*  And then. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=687.0400000000001s)]
*  And now he's running the sons. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=689.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=690.6400000000001s)]
*  And so I was like, what? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=691.12s)]
*  And then I even had Isaiah on years later. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=692.48s)]
*  It's somebody had set it up for us and we had him on and I was like, Hey, when [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=695.44s)]
*  you did this deal here, but then you said this and the guy that set up the interview [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  saw me in the hallway and he was just like, he did not, he thought he was just [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=703.0400000000001s)]
*  going to come on with you and bullshit about the NBA playoffs for seven minutes. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=706.44s)]
*  And you started going through his entire basketball reference history. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  He's like, I can't imagine. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=712.5200000000001s)]
*  But again, he hated you way more than me. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=713.96s)]
*  So I think I was in the clear. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=715.6s)]
*  We ironed it out. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=717.6s)]
*  I'm surprised. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm surprised he didn't want to just hate you forever. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=720.36s)]
*  Nah, we're fine. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=722.96s)]
*  What's your next pick? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=724.32s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=727.6s)]
*  This is actually where the board gets a little interesting. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=729.6400000000001s)]
*  I have a couple picks left that I really liked. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=735.96s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and say wizards again. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=736.2s)]
*  Oh, that was my next one. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  Great value. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  The problem is, is the guys that you're going to be paying, like Przingus opting [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=741.08s)]
*  out to get more money would scare the shit out of me. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=746.08s)]
*  I like Kuzma. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=748.32s)]
*  Uh, I like Kuzma in a certain number. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=750.2s)]
*  And then my number one dude, your favorite player, Bradley Beal is not that guy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=752.08s)]
*  He's not, I know his numbers say he's that guy, but so the problem is, is if [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=756.9200000000001s)]
*  you're Washington, you're like, we're paying a money for B minus players. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=760.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're our big three is a 37 and 45 team and then Beal has a no trade clause. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  So even if you want to get out of the Beal business, you still need his permission. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=776.5999999999999s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=782.64s)]
*  You never, and it's so funny because, you know, this has been house's whole life [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=783.8s)]
*  ever since I've known him of them, just having these static teams of big money [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=787.52s)]
*  guys that then you can't kind of get out of the team you've created, no flexibility. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=791.68s)]
*  This is just what the wizards do. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=796.76s)]
*  I think it's great value. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  I have no idea what Przingus is worth. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=799.6s)]
*  You could tell me he's going to sign for 80 for four years and I'd be like, okay, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  I have no idea if he's going to make it two years. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=808.04s)]
*  You can tell me he's going to sign for 150 for four years. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=810.36s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=813.88s)]
*  I don't know what his value is. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=814.96s)]
*  I don't even know who they're competing against, but he was pretty good last year. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  He was like 20 and nine, something like that. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=819.16s)]
*  And he played the whole year. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't hurt. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=822.0s)]
*  So wait, the last, the last time they've been in the Eastern conference finals was. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=823.28s)]
*  Was in the seventies. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=828.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  It was the 1979 bullets. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=830.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's grim. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=833.9599999999999s)]
*  It's, it's about as grim as it gets. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=835.24s)]
*  The nuggets were kind of secretly grim too, but the wizards even had them beat. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=837.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=843.12s)]
*  Um, I'm going to take Houston. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=844.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I like this because it's not just about Houston. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=848.84s)]
*  It's about comparing Houston to everything else. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  Cause Houston's at least a thought on the board, but, uh, go ahead and explain yourself. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=853.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=857.76s)]
*  Well, well the board's gotten a lot harder, so we'll start there. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=858.0400000000001s)]
*  Um, I don't know who my, there's no doubt this guy is a keeper guy in that team is. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=862.2s)]
*  They have some talent. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=870.6800000000001s)]
*  I like we've, they've had a losing record. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=871.48s)]
*  I think they're like 42 and one 40 for the last two years, something like 42 and one [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=873.52s)]
*  20. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=880.0s)]
*  I can't remember where it is. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=880.36s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=881.12s)]
*  Um, I've no idea if anybody on that team can be the top three guy on a team that can win [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=882.48s)]
*  the title. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=887.84s)]
*  They ended up with the number four pick in a draft that has three guys and then drops. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=888.96s)]
*  They have all this cap space, but it seems like they're going to spend it on James [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=895.04s)]
*  Harden because that's what the owner wants, which is another piece of this ranking is [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=898.28s)]
*  I have to work for the owner. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=901.96s)]
*  And I just think there's teams that have better situations going up and down the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  board. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=909.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't really know what my go at least I have this. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=909.72s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=913.0799999999999s)]
*  So, uh, unfortunately I'm gonna take Houston. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=915.16s)]
*  Now they might be able to hit that number four pick. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  Maybe one of those Thompson twins will end up being the best guy in the draft [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=919.84s)]
*  other than one Binyam. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=923.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=923.88s)]
*  But, um, I dunno, it probably sounds a wee bit harsh, but I, I had [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=924.84s)]
*  everybody that was left on the board. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=933.08s)]
*  That was the one that jumped out to me. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=934.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=936.32s)]
*  It feels a little harsh until you actually run through the exercise, right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=936.48s)]
*  Cause, um, you know, if you, if you started kicking around like Detroit, you go, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=939.4000000000001s)]
*  all right, I think they may know who their backcourt is and the other piece [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=944.08s)]
*  they're going to add to it here. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=947.36s)]
*  Charlotte was my number one pick Orlando. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=948.6800000000001s)]
*  We liked their roster wizards. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=950.44s)]
*  We already took, I mean, I guess I could go Pacers and go, are they going to be [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=951.76s)]
*  stuck in purgatory here for a little while? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=954.88s)]
*  I'd rather have the Pacers roster and they'd rather have their assets. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=956.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=959.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=960.5200000000001s)]
*  So then you go, okay, what about in the West? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=960.88s)]
*  Like I thought about maybe Dallas because of the Kyrie situation that you put [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=963.96s)]
*  yourself into where you have, like, if you end up giving Kyrie three with a [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=967.76s)]
*  conditional fourth year on it or some shit where it's actually all incentivized [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=972.1600000000001s)]
*  and so they're going to, then I would, I would have already taken them, but I [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=975.96s)]
*  don't know what's going to happen here with Dallas. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=979.0s)]
*  Uh, you can't take Dallas because of the Luca thing, because at least [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=980.96s)]
*  Dallas always has to get out of jail free card. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=984.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  They, and if they have to trade Luca, they'll get more for him [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=986.76s)]
*  than anyone's ever gotten for a trade. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=989.8s)]
*  So at least they know they have that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=991.7199999999999s)]
*  No, they had, they know who their guy is and it feels like Houston's given [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=993.04s)]
*  Jaylen Green two years to just see if he can be the guy. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=997.56s)]
*  And honestly, he feels like a talented player who was just the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1001.4799999999999s)]
*  primary option on a really bad team. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1005.0799999999999s)]
*  So the numbers are going to look good. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1006.68s)]
*  Even if certain nights you were like, well, I have no idea what they're doing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1008.52s)]
*  And so Houston's the right call over San Antonio, clearly with [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1011.68s)]
*  Lynn Benyama with Utah and all the picks. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1016.0s)]
*  Dallas having a real guy, the Pelicans, despite their injuries, having a better [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1018.0s)]
*  roster, Oklahoma city, all their assets. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1021.96s)]
*  We already took Minnesota. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1024.0s)]
*  So yeah, I think Houston's a totally fair one. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1025.36s)]
*  And if they max out hard and bring them back, I might take them number one. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1027.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1031.6s)]
*  They would vault. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1031.84s)]
*  They would vault up the, we did the ringer draft board for this. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1032.8s)]
*  They would vault up. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1035.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1036.96s)]
*  Two more picks. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1037.2s)]
*  Who do you have for your last one? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1037.84s)]
*  Um, well, I kind of know. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1040.84s)]
*  I, yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1045.2s)]
*  If Kyrie goes to Dallas, Dallas. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a great pick. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1050.44s)]
*  It kind of isn't though. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1052.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, like I'm, I do. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1054.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I already went through the exercise and said it all out here. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1055.48s)]
*  Like having a good value. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1058.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1060.96s)]
*  But having a top five guy who's kind of like a no doubt top five guy, even if [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1061.2s)]
*  he's taken some dings after making it to the conference finals last year and not [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1065.5600000000002s)]
*  getting out of the plan, not even getting into it, um, that might make it wrong, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1069.0400000000002s)]
*  but I'm just, I'm adding the Kyrie part of it on top of the fact that, you know, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1073.6s)]
*  they, they got a Christian wood decision to make and every other thing. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1077.3999999999999s)]
*  So there's going to be a couple of guys that don't like that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1080.72s)]
*  They're probably going to be on a contract there. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1082.36s)]
*  The fear with that trade is you wake up one morning, Lucas, like I went out. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1085.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1089.76s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1090.56s)]
*  Cause the thing is there's people that want to play with Luca. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1092.84s)]
*  Like there's guys you'll hear about dudes who are like, I want to play with [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1095.6s)]
*  Luca, but there's nothing really there. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1098.48s)]
*  And that's probably why they're going to do the Kyrie deal. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1102.44s)]
*  I don't love this pick, but we're running out of teams. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1109.76s)]
*  I'm going to take Brooklyn because, um, you know, they're going to be [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1113.96s)]
*  missing some picks going forward. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1119.8400000000001s)]
*  I think they're fine. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  They're kind of in that no man's land. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1122.1200000000001s)]
*  I really like bridges. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1123.64s)]
*  They're going to resign cam Johnson. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1124.96s)]
*  I like clax then. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1127.04s)]
*  Like they have, you know, it's not, it's not terrible. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1127.96s)]
*  They don't have like a top 20 guy. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1130.96s)]
*  Um, they don't really have the roadmap for the top 20 guy, unless, uh, they [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1134.08s)]
*  can get lucky once they're back in the free agency game, but more importantly [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  to me is just like, we had this whole Brooklyn run that really started when [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1144.2s)]
*  Procroft bought the team and went all the way through this Durant, Hardin, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1148.24s)]
*  and, uh, and Kyrie and where they had all these chances to be more relevant [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  than the Knicks and then the Knicks won one playoff series and it felt a [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1157.52s)]
*  hundred times more relevant in the tri-state area. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1161.52s)]
*  There's just so many more Knicks fans. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1164.16s)]
*  You're just, you're just drawn with a dead hand with Brooklyn. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1165.44s)]
*  The only way they can change that is if they end up with one of the five most [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1168.36s)]
*  transcendent guys in the league, but they had one and it still wasn't like amazing. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1171.76s)]
*  You know, so I don't, that job would just be tough because you have an owner who [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1176.24s)]
*  doesn't care how much money he spends. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1181.24s)]
*  But you've had now a few years of, oh, if only that hadn't happened and that [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1182.88s)]
*  hadn't happened, that hadn't happened. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1187.96s)]
*  And now I don't really know what your nucleus is. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1189.2s)]
*  What is it? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1191.8000000000002s)]
*  What's the upside of that team? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  45 wins max. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1194.16s)]
*  So it's, it's Brooklyn. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1197.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't feel great about it, but I thought they were the best in the board. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1199.4s)]
*  They do get some of the picks back with the Phoenix deal, you know, but they're [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1202.5600000000002s)]
*  not going to be picking, uh, as high as maybe they should be with a reflection of [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1207.0400000000002s)]
*  what the record is going to be. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1211.28s)]
*  But I feel like this was a six team draft. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1212.0s)]
*  And then our last two picks were reaches. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1214.16s)]
*  Cause I, I feel wrong even putting Dallas down really good owner, you know, guy [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1216.52s)]
*  wants to spend the money, gets it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1221.2s)]
*  And you have the top five guy, you have a no doubt guy, but if you get into the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1223.6s)]
*  Kyrie business, I'm immediately out. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1226.96s)]
*  I'm just out. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1229.2s)]
*  And so that's kind of my runner up choice for that spot was Philadelphia. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1230.08s)]
*  Because if they lose hard and I don't know how they replaced the asset and now [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1234.4s)]
*  it's Embiid with Maxie and the expiring Tobias Harris contract and PJ Tucker. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1238.8799999999999s)]
*  And they have to buy service. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1245.28s)]
*  I don't really know what I'm looking at. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1247.76s)]
*  And the Embiid trade requests kind of looming at this point. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1249.9199999999998s)]
*  So I was looking at them, but it's hard to put a team that has a top five guy. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1254.1999999999998s)]
*  Same reason you had a tough time with Dallas. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1258.24s)]
*  At least you have that asset. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1260.6799999999998s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1262.52s)]
*  So top six was Charlotte, Chicago, Minnesota, Clipper, and then you have [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1263.04s)]
*  Clippers, Wizards, Houston. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1268.0s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1272.2s)]
*  Neither of us put Memphis. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1272.72s)]
*  No, I think just because there's a, there is a version of this thing [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1276.2s)]
*  working itself out here and when they're all healthy, they're New Orleans. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1278.96s)]
*  Now it's too much talent, even with the Zion problem. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1284.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1287.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1289.1200000000001s)]
*  But who would you rather have? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  Like if you're on the phone, New Orleans, then be Brooklyn. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1290.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  I'd rather deal with the Zion problem and hope, Hey, Zion's gluten-free now. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1294.0s)]
*  He is. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1299.08s)]
*  He's down to 250. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1300.4399999999998s)]
*  He dumped over the shot clock the other day. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1302.84s)]
*  What? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1304.8s)]
*  Did you see his sit down with Malika Andrews? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1305.8799999999999s)]
*  He really understands his diet now. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1307.6399999999999s)]
*  Like, he does no more bread pudding. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1309.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1311.9599999999998s)]
*  It's like, that's coming though. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1312.84s)]
*  That's coming. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1314.08s)]
*  He's going to do the sit down with somebody. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  He's going to talk about, Oh, you know this. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1316.12s)]
*  I finally get it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1318.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1319.6799999999998s)]
*  I think Luca needs to do some of this stuff too, to be honest. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  Luca and Zion are there one, two in some order and the, can you get in shape, please? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1322.72s)]
*  Malone's talked about it with Jokic. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1326.56s)]
*  I thought it was interesting hearing him talk about Jokic was in shape, but not [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1328.2s)]
*  a hundred percent, and now he's in crazy shape and can run all game. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1331.88s)]
*  Do you remember when Jokic was like not fat Jokic, but Oh my God, did he just [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1335.88s)]
*  lose all this weight after the shutdown of COVID? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1340.16s)]
*  Remember the pictures? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1343.88s)]
*  Granted, pictures can look really, really bad, but it all of a sudden he like [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1344.96s)]
*  looked emaciated and you were like, Oh my God, Jokic is now he's like, no, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1349.72s)]
*  actually from that point on he's been, you know, arguably the best player in the league. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JjZO73hc&t=1353.52s)]
