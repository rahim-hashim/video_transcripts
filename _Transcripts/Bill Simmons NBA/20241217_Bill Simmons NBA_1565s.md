# The NBA Needs Its Next “Unicorn” Moment  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=criZOmMgPR8)
*  Alright, I am taping this after the NBA Cup final in Vegas, the Milwaukee Bucks.
*  They destroyed the Oklahoma City Thunder.
*  Who could not hit a shot?
*  It happens.
*  They looked young.
*  They looked a little nervous.
*  They looked like a team of young guys from Oklahoma City who had just spent the last
*  five days in Las Vegas.
*  They looked like a team that didn't realize they were at the adult table where Giannis
*  was sitting, who proceeded to unleash holy hell on them, which he's been doing basically
*  for over a month now.
*  I think the last 16 games he's something like 34, 15 and 7.
*  He doesn't shoot threes anymore, which I think, not like he was jacking up 10 a game, but
*  he was always shooting three.
*  He would always kind of test it out, but now he's just like, I'm going to be early 2000
*  Shaq crossed with Spider-Man.
*  As I'm recording this, he's plus 600 for MVP on Fandl and he's closed the gap with him
*  in Jokic, as great as Jokic has been.
*  Jokic seems like a real contender.
*  OKC still seems like a contender.
*  This is the league now.
*  If you don't make threes, you're probably not going to win.
*  If you're shooting 35 to 50 threes a game, if they're not going in, you don't have a
*  chance, which ties into a bigger theme with what's going on with basketball right now.
*  The last couple of weeks have been peak.
*  People asking me what's going on with the NBA.
*  And part of it is the ratings, because everyone loves to talk about ratings, even though the
*  NBA just signed a $76 billion deal and the ratings don't ultimately really matter.
*  It's an American thing more than a worldwide thing because the league's doing well globally.
*  But when you look at big picture, what's going on with the league, you know, LeBron and Curry,
*  they're old.
*  They're making desperate changes.
*  They just changed the All-Star game again.
*  They just did the NBA Cup in Vegas.
*  Too many foreign stars.
*  That's another thing you keep hearing.
*  The schedule is too long.
*  I've been saying that for 20 years.
*  We can't find any under 30 American superstars to carry the torch from LeBron and Curry.
*  That's a valid thing.
*  Too many threes.
*  Too much sameness in the game.
*  Can't really counter that.
*  Too woke.
*  The league's too woke.
*  It's driven off a lot of possible fans.
*  I'm not touching that one.
*  It's an American problem and it's not a worldwide problem because again, worldwide,
*  internationally, the league is doing really well.
*  But it's an American problem.
*  And yet the franchise values are the highest it's ever been.
*  They just got the highest meteorite steal they've ever gotten.
*  They have, I would say, 35 to 40 completely recognizable stars, whereas football might have 10.
*  So it's not like this is a disaster, but this is what we do with the NBA.
*  We love to panic.
*  We love to talk about how things are bad.
*  And it's a little like what SNL is like where everybody's like, SNL's dead.
*  SNL's done.
*  And then guess what?
*  SNL's going to have its 50th year.
*  This is an American problem.
*  And this is eight decades of a recurring theme that I would call the NBA is in danger that we're now living through again in December 2024.
*  I want to go backwards.
*  I want to go through eight decades of NBA history to show that for the most part, this is a league that's kind of always a little bit in danger.
*  Like football dating back to the John Unitas beating the Giants in the late 50s, the greatest game ever played to that point.
*  Football has always been solid.
*  50s, 60s, 70s, Super Bowl, the merger.
*  It's just been going and going.
*  The only time I ever remember people even wondering what the future of football is going to be like.
*  And I was one of the ones wondering was early 2010s with concussions, Goodell.
*  We had a bunch of stuff with Gates after it.
*  It seemed like they had to change the way that football was being played because it was too violent.
*  And there was a moment there was like, where's football?
*  Are you going to let your sons play football?
*  Are we going to be watching this in 20 years?
*  And guess what?
*  COVID happened and everybody was like, you know what?
*  I love football.
*  And now football feels like it's the biggest it's ever been.
*  So you go back to the 40s and 50s, the first 15 years of the league.
*  The league, by the time we got to 1954, the league was in complete chaos.
*  The pace was too slow.
*  There was no shot clock.
*  People were just fouling each other and trying to dribble out the clock.
*  George Michael was dominating everything and the league kind of sucked.
*  And then they came up with a shot clock.
*  That fixed some of it.
*  It was still really violent.
*  It was a lot like hockey back then.
*  There wasn't nearly enough scoring.
*  They had a big betting scandal.
*  That was a big thing.
*  There were barely any black players, kind of a problem.
*  All the best black players were playing for the Harlem Globetrotters, other places,
*  because they wouldn't let them in the league.
*  And when you think back to where the NBA was, even in the mid-50s when Russell showed up,
*  it was regional.
*  Everything was in the East Coast or like the Pennsylvania area, the fringes of the Midwest.
*  There were no West Coast teams.
*  And the NFL was bigger.
*  College football and college basketball were bigger.
*  Baseball was bigger.
*  Boxing, horse racing.
*  Name of sport.
*  It was probably dead even with hockey.
*  Get to the 60s.
*  Russell's in there.
*  We start finally getting some black stars.
*  We get Elgin Baylor.
*  We get Oscar.
*  We get Will Chamberlain.
*  And the 60s becomes, you know, Wilt versus Russell.
*  Celtics dominance.
*  It's still not going awesome.
*  We still don't have like a definitive the league is fine moment.
*  And at the same time, this is one of the most tumultuous decades in American history.
*  There's a whole civil rights battle happening.
*  There's assassinations all over the place.
*  And, you know, a league that's becoming a mostly black league had a pretty strange fit among all of that,
*  especially as Russell is becoming one of the dominant athletes we've ever had and a huge spokesman along with Ollie and Jim Brown and some others.
*  So the league is gaining steam from an impact standpoint, but it still hasn't hit the popular piece yet.
*  And then we have our first unicorn situation.
*  There's five unicorn situations total.
*  And I want you to remember this because we're going to tie it back in at the end.
*  So this first unicorn situation, the 1969 finals, which turned out to be Russell's last NBA finals, he's going for his 11th title.
*  They're underdogs against the Lakers.
*  We finally have a California team.
*  We have Jerry West and Will Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor.
*  And the Lakers are favored to win Game 7 and away.
*  Russell beats them.
*  And it turns out to be like the first great modern NBA finals game that we had the next year.
*  The Knicks.
*  Everyone in New York is like so delighted.
*  The Knicks are finally good at basketball like the Celtics are gone.
*  They have a chance to win the title.
*  1970 finals, Willis gets hurt, comes back Game 7 becomes one of the most famous games in NBA history.
*  Also, Will kind of chokes.
*  So we have that.
*  Kareem enters the league that same year.
*  And then in 1971, he wins the title.
*  Jerry West is the most famous Ballyhoo college player to that point.
*  To somebody that's considered to be a successor to Russell and Wilt.
*  So he's in the league.
*  And then the next year, 71-72, the Lakers win 33 straight.
*  Jerry West finally wins the title.
*  So you have this four year unicorn run.
*  All these crazy events.
*  And it propels the league up a level.
*  And all of a sudden now the NBA is looking really good.
*  Well, we have to go back to the danger zone again.
*  1973 to 1976, they over expand.
*  They make the classic mistake of they just add too many teams.
*  The ABA has formed and is stealing a lot of the young players.
*  So all of a sudden the quality of the play is starting to go down.
*  The quality of the officiating is starting to go down.
*  ABC loses the NBA to CBS because CBS kind of double crosses Rune Arledge, who's the most important sports executive probably of all time.
*  And Rune Arledge is pissed and decides to counter program the living shit out of the NBA.
*  College football, college basketball, wide world of sports, the superstars competition.
*  And he just makes it his life's mission to set the NBA backwards.
*  There's a salary boom that happens where all of a sudden you have some guys that aren't doing that well who are making a lot of money and everyone's really aware of it.
*  Sidney Wicks, Pete Maravich, Spencer Heywood.
*  So there's animosity toward basketball players for the first time.
*  The Knicks and Lakers are done at that point by the time we get to the mid 70s.
*  And they have the future of the league or so we would have thought on paper.
*  Dr. J. Julius Erving. He's in the ABA.
*  He's not even on television.
*  So the NBA not only is getting older with some of their older stars like, you know, Havlicek, Jerry West, all the guys from previous generation Oscar.
*  But Doc, the guy who's supposed to come in and carry the league with Fereem is in the wrong league and not on TV.
*  And I'm a young kid in Boston.
*  I would have loved watching Dr. J. Not on TV.
*  So again, we're in danger.
*  And then what happens?
*  We have a second unicorn situation.
*  The 1976 finals.
*  Havlicek and Cowens on Boston, two of the most famous guys in the league.
*  They're playing Phoenix, triple overtime game.
*  I was lucky enough to be at the game with my dad.
*  I was six years old.
*  I might have slept through the fourth quarter in the first two over times.
*  But it turns out to be the greatest game in the history of the league.
*  Celtics win the title.
*  The NBA is back.
*  The ABA merges into the NBA that summer.
*  All of a sudden we have Dr. J. David Thompson, George Gervin, George McGuinness, all the Moses Malone.
*  All these guys are now in the NBA and the NBA has 22 teams and stacked.
*  And it's awesome.
*  And that leads to Kareem jumping to Kareem's already in L.A.
*  Walton's on the Blazers.
*  The Blazers take off that year.
*  And it's a late run.
*  Second half of the year into the playoffs.
*  They beat Kareem.
*  Then a beating Dr. J. and Philly in the finals.
*  Bill Walton.
*  Turns out maybe he's the next Bill Russell.
*  Everybody's in love with the guy.
*  He's got the beard.
*  He takes the jersey off after they win.
*  So this is unicorn number two situation.
*  76 finals, 77 finals.
*  Basketball seems like a big deal.
*  Basketball seems like it's in the best shape that it's been in maybe ever.
*  What happens?
*  We go back to the danger zone.
*  The late 70s into the early 80s.
*  Walton gets hurt the next year.
*  Never really recovers.
*  It would be like when Benyama won the title this year and then just got hurt and we didn't see him for six years.
*  The cocaine era happens.
*  And the cocaine, that's hitting all the sports.
*  That's hitting Hollywood.
*  That's hitting the comedy circles.
*  Cocaine starts to wipe out.
*  Pretty much everybody starting in 1978.
*  And it does some real damage to the NBA.
*  And cuts short some careers.
*  Changes the course of some careers.
*  Some young stars that they're counting on go sideways.
*  So you have that.
*  You have the Kermit Washington punch in late 1977.
*  That's the 77-78 season where he punches Rudy Tomjanovic.
*  A white guy.
*  And all this ugly stuff surfaces up.
*  All the casual racism that people felt toward a mostly black league being catered in.
*  Being catered and sold to mostly white fans.
*  That all pops up.
*  And this crazy two-year run of you can go back and read some of the old Sports Illustrated things about the league's too black.
*  It's never going to work.
*  And it fucking goes crazy.
*  In a bad, bad, bad way.
*  In a way that even as a little kid, I was kind of noticing the way they were talking about it.
*  It was not great.
*  We had the dumb owner apex back then.
*  This is when basically anybody could buy an NBA team.
*  And you just had these dumb owners.
*  The Celtics for a year had John White Brown.
*  He was terrible.
*  Just dumb owners making dumb trades.
*  Not trying to build anything.
*  So the teams are just in constant chaos.
*  You have the dumb commissioner apex too.
*  Larry O'Brien who is awful.
*  David Stern comes in and looks 100 times better compared to him a few years later.
*  You have CBS fucking up the playoffs.
*  Either tape delaying the primetime games.
*  Or making the NBA schedule weekend playoff games so that you're playing game three and game four of a series back to back days.
*  So they could care less about the health of the players.
*  They really didn't want to show the NBA because it wasn't doing that well.
*  So you had that.
*  You had college hoops.
*  The NFL, baseball, NHL, boxing, college football, and horse racing are all more popular than the NBA by the end of the 70s.
*  Because they have the Washington Seattle finals twice around.
*  Which are great basketball finals.
*  But not exactly a marquee finals.
*  And all of it is eventually captured and breaks the game by David Halberstam.
*  The best sports book of all time.
*  That comes out I think in 82.
*  But the NBA, like the Lakers play the Sixers I think in 82 and 83.
*  And some of those games weren't even on live television.
*  They weren't on until 1130 on the East Coast.
*  That's how bad it was for the NBA.
*  So I'm going to say a little more dangerous than right now.
*  Leading to our third unicorn situation.
*  The 1984 finals.
*  We had Bird and Magic in the league for a while.
*  They don't play against each other in the finals.
*  Even though they have this great rivalry dating back to 79 when college basketball was way bigger than the NBA.
*  Bird and Magic play each other during the same year at CBS.
*  It's like you know what?
*  We're showing all of these finals games live now.
*  We're going to show them in prime time.
*  We're going to really try to get behind the league.
*  And they get Bird and Magic.
*  They get a seven game series.
*  They get one of the great series in the history of the league.
*  They have Michael Jordan on the Olympic team that summer coming into the league on the Chicago Bulls.
*  The third biggest market they have.
*  MJ happens.
*  And then we're off.
*  We get David Stern.
*  We get Cable.
*  We have USA and ESPN by that point.
*  So as a little kid on the East Coast all of a sudden I couldn't see George Gervin and David Thompson or whoever in the 70s.
*  Unless I went to the Boston Garden to see them.
*  Now in the 80s I can just pop on Cable.
*  I can see Dominique Wilkins.
*  I can see Isaiah Thomas.
*  I can see Adrian Dandley.
*  Whoever I want I can see.
*  I can see Magic Johnson on the other coast.
*  So that's happening.
*  They're figuring out how to brand stuff better.
*  And once MJ really gets going with the Bulls.
*  The NBA takes off.
*  We get the NBA. Fantastic commercials.
*  And we have this incredible Unicorn.
*  15 year run.
*  Bird versus Magic.
*  Jordan six titles.
*  We have the Riley Nicks and Hakim and Barkley and Isaiah's Pistons.
*  We have the Blazers.
*  Shawn Kemp and GP.
*  Stockton and Malone.
*  I didn't really like watching them that much but I'm going to throw them in anyway.
*  On and on and on it went.
*  And it was the watershed time to ever be a basketball fan.
*  It was the most talent concentrated into one area.
*  Everyone's playing super hard.
*  The league was the most fun.
*  I would say in the late 80s early 90s.
*  And it just keeps Jordan retires.
*  They're fine because the Knicks make it that year.
*  Jordan comes back.
*  It becomes the biggest story.
*  Really of anything other than maybe the decision with LeBron.
*  Jordan wins three straight titles in a row in the Bulls.
*  Including the 72 win Bulls.
*  And the NBA just goes.
*  It's just arrow pointing up.
*  All of it's captured in the last dance.
*  Well what happens?
*  We hit the danger zone again.
*  MJ retires.
*  Right after he retires.
*  Lockout.
*  No basketball for six, seven months.
*  People are pissed.
*  Because these guys are making so much money.
*  The young guys are able to switch teams.
*  Three, four years.
*  Everyone starts getting mad.
*  All the ugly casual racism stuff.
*  Starts percolating a little bit again.
*  It's like hip hop culture infected the NBA.
*  Stern puts in a dress code.
*  Wasn't great.
*  Not great times.
*  Well what happens?
*  We don't have an MJ successor.
*  Grant Hill.
*  KG. Tim Duncan.
*  C-Web.
*  Iverson.
*  Shaq.
*  We're an MJ successors.
*  And then.
*  2000.
*  Kobe and Shaq.
*  So we have Shaq and Kobe together.
*  We kind of know something's happening with Kobe.
*  And in the 2000 season.
*  That's unicorn number four.
*  Shaq and Kobe.
*  Shaq fouls out of game four of the finals.
*  Kobe comes in.
*  Puts on the Superman.
*  Kobe comes in.
*  Puts on the Superman cape.
*  Wins the game.
*  They end up winning the title.
*  This is after they escaped against Portland the previous round.
*  And now we have this crazy Kobe and Shaq run.
*  That was like real drama.
*  Real theater.
*  The 2001 Laker team is probably one of the two best teams of the century.
*  As of that's happening.
*  A phenom named LeBron James is in high school.
*  He's going to be in the 2003 draft.
*  With Carmelo and some others.
*  And the league looks great.
*  So in 2000 and 2003.
*  That is our unicorn number four moment.
*  Shaq and Kobe ending up on the same team.
*  In Los Angeles, California.
*  On the Lakers.
*  Couldn't have worked out better.
*  Well, we immediately hit the danger zone again in 2003.
*  We have the Kobe incident.
*  And the trial.
*  Not great.
*  We have the 2003 and 2004 finals.
*  Which were rock fights.
*  And ESPN Classic.
*  And NBA TV Hardware Classics.
*  Which I think are banned from showing any of those games.
*  Defense got too good.
*  The game got too physical.
*  We had Kobe and Shaq
*  falling apart.
*  The game slowed down.
*  The pace slowed down.
*  To the point that after the 2004 season they had to add all these rule changes.
*  And these other legal defense stuff.
*  Just to try to quicken stuff up again.
*  And you had a league
*  that was built around Tim Duncan.
*  I think he's one of the seven best players of all time.
*  Didn't really resonate with people.
*  Like he should have.
*  Dirk Nowitzki, German.
*  KG.
*  Mostly stuck on bad teams except for 0-4.
*  C-Web.
*  Dwayne Wade.
*  Angry Kobe.
*  Young LeBron on crappy Cavs teams.
*  It was grim.
*  If you remember when I was writing for Page 2.
*  Back when my fingers worked.
*  I used to have a joke about how I was one of the last 20 NBA fans.
*  The joke was that the NBA kind of sucks now.
*  But I still love it.
*  This was a gimmick that I would do.
*  Because we were in real danger with the league.
*  Culminating in the 0-6 finals.
*  Where we had the referee controversy.
*  With Dallas and Miami.
*  And we've all agreed not to talk about the 2006 finals.
*  Then the 2007 finals.
*  Where the East was in such bad shape.
*  LeBron ends up making the finals.
*  He's a heroic performance by him.
*  With just an awful Cavs team.
*  That I think would be a 14 seed.
*  If we had them in the season now.
*  So things are grim.
*  Things are bad.
*  There's a lot of what's wrong.
*  You can go back and search for my column archives.
*  Multiple what's wrong with the NBA column.
*  What happens?
*  Well, unicorn number five situation happens.
*  2008 to 2018.
*  In short order.
*  We get the probably illegal Palgasol trade.
*  Where the Lakers just steal Palgasol.
*  And nobody even else knows he's available.
*  Thanks again to Chris Wallace.
*  For creating the second mini Kobe dynasty.
*  Gasol is a great player.
*  He's a great player for the Kobe dynasty.
*  Gasol and the Lakers.
*  Now the Lakers are a contender.
*  KG's already been traded to Boston.
*  Now Boston's a contender.
*  All of a sudden we have Celtics Lakers in 2008.
*  And we're off baby.
*  We're back.
*  Kobe loses in 08.
*  But wins the next two finals.
*  Celtics are in there in 2010 against them.
*  After 2010.
*  LeBron who can't get it done with Cleveland.
*  The decision.
*  He's probably the single biggest off the court
*  NBA moment that we've had.
*  Other than MJ retiring.
*  The decision.
*  He changes teams.
*  People lose their fucking minds.
*  Goes to Miami.
*  All of a sudden we have Miami LeBron.
*  We have aging but still fun Kobe on a contender Lakers.
*  Aging but still fun Celtics.
*  A bunch of great young players coming up.
*  Like KD and Russ on the Thunder.
*  It's just going and going and going.
*  And then what happens?
*  Curry and the Warriors show up.
*  Curry reinvents basketball.
*  He's hitting threes from all over the place.
*  With Klay Thompson.
*  They have their little run.
*  This goes all the way through 2019.
*  2019 finals is the tipping point.
*  Durant gets hurt.
*  Klay gets hurt.
*  That Warriors dynasty ends.
*  Durant we lose a year of his prime.
*  We lose a whole year of Curry's prime with the Warriors.
*  Really two years.
*  But that was our last unicorn stretch.
*  2008 to 2019.
*  And then what happens?
*  We're in danger again.
*  Starting in 2020.
*  The bubble.
*  The bubble ends this really fun NBA season we're having.
*  Where LeBron in the Lakers.
*  Kawhi in the Clippers.
*  Yannis is on his way up.
*  Jokic is on his way up.
*  And Beed's on his way up.
*  Tatum and Brown are on Boston.
*  And it just feels like.
*  And then boom.
*  The bubble.
*  Weird.
*  The player movement becomes out of control.
*  It just feels like every year guys are switching teams.
*  It starts to feel a little more like NBA 2K.
*  Load management becomes a bigger story.
*  The schedule is too long.
*  We all hate it.
*  They won't do anything about it.
*  The three point stuff.
*  Just gets worse and worse and worse.
*  Now we have the Celtics shooting over 53.
*  So there's a sameness to a lot of the games.
*  That I think.
*  A lot of people are down on.
*  I would encourage people to go back and watch some of the terrible post ups.
*  In the 80's and 90's.
*  And see if you still don't like threes.
*  But there's definitely a curry effect.
*  With how the game is being played.
*  The foreign stars.
*  Are now all the best under 30 guys.
*  And this is a league that dating back to Hakeem.
*  Who was just one of the best players I've ever seen in my life.
*  But he wasn't from here.
*  And he never resonated like an American guy.
*  Now we have Yoke Ejinyan.
*  And he's a great guy.
*  And he's an American guy.
*  Now we have Yoke Ejinyan, Esam Luka, and Embiid.
*  And Wemby.
*  And maybe even SGA.
*  If he can bounce back from a terrible NBA cup.
*  And become a real guy this year.
*  And maybe take OKC to the finals.
*  Those are six guys that aren't from here.
*  And we're talking about when is the next star.
*  This is a league that's so beholden to the Lebron Curry Duran era.
*  And seems so afraid to pass the torch to the under 30 guys.
*  And we're talking about when is the next star.
*  This is a league that's so beholden to the Lebron Curry Duran era.
*  And seems so afraid to pass the torch to the under 30 guys.
*  And seems so afraid to pass the torch to the under 30 guys.
*  You can see with the TV schedule.
*  OKC is on TV this year.
*  Less than the Lakers.
*  Less than the Warriors.
*  Because they keep feeding us.
*  Lebron and Curry.
*  You watch ESPN.
*  All the content they're doing on first take and on the NBA today.
*  It's always Lakers, Lakers, Lakers.
*  They're playing the hits.
*  And it's coming at the expense of trying to build up these new stars.
*  And it's coming at the expense of trying to build up these new stars.
*  Which we even saw in the Olympics.
*  I thought Lebron and Curry and Duran watching those guys.
*  Like Fendoff, Serbia and France.
*  Like that was amazing stuff.
*  But it did come at the expense of the next generation of guys.
*  But it did come at the expense of the next generation of guys.
*  Who kind of needed a moment like that.
*  And I think this league is...
*  If there's a criticism that I think is valid.
*  If there's a criticism that I think is valid.
*  It's pushing these guys that have kind of already had their moment.
*  That were already great.
*  And trying to extract more great moments from them.
*  And trying to extract more great moments from them.
*  When there's probably not a lot of greatness left.
*  And then there's rolling the dice with some of the new guys.
*  Which is...
*  You know, I see why they do it.
*  But at the same time, they gotta be pushing the younger guys more.
*  But at the same time, they gotta be pushing the younger guys more.
*  And at the same time, you have somebody like Edwards.
*  Who is such a unique and original guy.
*  Who is such a unique and original guy.
*  And then he shows up for this season shooting 12 threes a game.
*  And he's starting to look like everybody else I'm watching.
*  So there's a sameness to the new guys.
*  So there's a sameness to the new guys.
*  And then you have somebody like Jokic.
*  Who is really bird in magic.
*  Trapped in a Serbian 7 foot doughy body.

*  But he's not from here.
*  And for whatever reason he doesn't cook with fans.
*  And for whatever reason he doesn't cook with fans.
*  I don't think the way he should.
*  So...
*  My point, big picture.
*  Is that we've had 5 unicorn moments.
*  Is that we've had 5 unicorn moments.
*  And now we're due for a sixth.
*  And this league has been around for 8 decades.
*  And now we're due for a sixth.
*  And this league has been around for 8 decades.
*  And in the middle of one.
*  Or we don't have one coming.
*  Everybody thinks the NBA is in trouble.
*  They're in danger.
*  It's over. This is just the DNA of the league.
*  And here's what's going to happen.
*  There's going to be some new player that comes in.
*  There's going to be some new player that comes in.
*  Some new team. Some new event.
*  It's going to shift this.
*  And all of a sudden we'll be like, oh.
*  It's like when we did the Vidswim Man documentary.
*  It's like when we did the Vidswim Man documentary.
*  Triple H had this great quote about...
*  When he was talking about when Stone Cold and Vince and that whole era.
*  When he was talking about when Stone Cold and Vince and that whole era.
*  And he was like...
*  It's like an earthquake.
*  It's like, did I feel that? Did something move?
*  And you just kind of know from a narrative standpoint something has moved.
*  And you just kind of know from a narrative standpoint something has moved.
*  And that's what the NBA needs right now.
*  I don't know what that's going to be.
*  But I'm going to bet on the 80 year history of the league.
*  And the fact that internationally it's fine.
*  This is an American problem.
*  People are losing interest in America because...
*  People are losing interest in America because...
*  They can watch fourth quarters of games on the NBA app.
*  They can follow it like what Derrick Thompson said on my podcast.
*  They can follow it like what Derrick Thompson said on my podcast.
*  You can follow the league without really watching it.
*  So the ratings are down.
*  But I'm not sure the interest is down.
*  What they're missing, ironically, is...
*  What they're missing, ironically, is...
*  What Women's College Basketball with the WNBA had.
*  Where Caitlin became somebody that people just wanted to watch.
*  Where Caitlin became somebody that people just wanted to watch.
*  They just wanted to watch her games.
*  They didn't care who she was playing.
*  They didn't care what the stakes were.
*  I think you could really make the case...
*  She's more valuable than anyone the NBA has.
*  Because she's the only must watch basketball player right now.
*  Because she's the only must watch basketball player right now.
*  Other than the old guys in the NBA.
*  So they have to figure out...
*  What is their unicorn moment?
*  But my prediction is that...
*  It's the NBA. It's been 80 years.
*  It's looked bleak before.
*  They always bounce back.
*  This is the league we have chosen.
