# Nikola Jokic Has Proved Heâ€™s the Best Player in the NBA | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3txJT3rLTM)
*  I think Denver's going to win the title. I felt that way heading into the conference finals. I feel even more strongly about it now
*  It just seems like this thing they have going with the Oakage
*  Um, it is the ultimate cheat code right now. I don't see a scenario where they don't win the title unless somebody gets hurt
*  What are you seeing?
*  I mean the I mean you know, it just is is the best player in the world right now
*  I mean that that goes without saying that's done right we've
*  Yeah, we're no longer accepting debates. We're turning your way at the door
*  We have decided this is now the best player in the world
*  Yeah, I think I think he is right now and I also though it's not not just him
*  Like it's jamal maury stepping up in the way he is. It's it's an entire roster mpj like look at the 1920 team
*  What they had it like the will bartons of the world
*  Oh, yeah team and they've replaced those guys with kcp and bruce brown who you raved about earlier
*  Jeff green aron gordon who's and I think you know
*  You got michael maloney benches gordon in the fourth quarter of game three and then aron gordon because he still has some offensive talent
*  Comes out and has an explosive game on offense and game four
*  Michael porter jr porter jr. What was he back in 1920? He was still a wild card now mpj
*  He's getting praised by malone after games for not for scoring
*  Which is what he was drafted for and known for but because of his defense because of making the extra pass the rebounding
*  He has transformed who he is as a player and honestly like
*  mpj is I mean
*  Yokich has become an even better player from his mvp years murray has improved but mpj is the
*  Is the true, you know transformation story on this nuggets team and has it was the x factor that they took a gamble on and it's
*  Been a total home run for them and malone as well
*  Like it's not it's not just the players but malone and that staff they've they mixed up defensive coverages against minnesota all throughout the series they
*  Adjusted their help against the suns throughout that series but they against the lakers stuck with the drop
*  Even when it felt like sometimes it wasn't working in that game for lakers are getting the basket
*  But they stuck with it and but they were also flexes. They wanted the brown to shoot
*  Yes, exactly
*  They wanted them to shoot and and it worked out but they were flexible with lineups
*  Sometimes like when yokich in game three he had a he was in foul trouble. They're able to play small. I I thought malone
*  Has pulled all the right strings throughout the postseason and all three series
*  And those players like it's a culmination of the steps that they took since the last time
*  You know they faced the lakers in the conference finals in the 2020 bubble
*  The all the improvement individual players have made since then and all the improvements the front office has made to that roster
*  It's it's built an absolute, you know machine. That's what it feels like they are right now watching them whether they just seem unstoppable
*  It was so funny sitting behind their bench for two games after sitting behind the warriors bench for two games
*  Kamingo like standing where jim goldstein was basically pull with the hoodie over his head and iguodala just walking around trying to
*  You know glue guys back together when that team was pretty broken
*  And then denver everybody's up
*  It's guys like like diandre jordan who didn't play a minute is super important on the bench his arms are around everybody
*  People are standing on all the big plays
*  um
*  and then you watch malone during the timeouts and there was a couple moments, especially game three was really interesting because
*  You know the the refs were just against them in that game and they knew it
*  They know like this is what the league's like. We're that we're up two onus areas
*  We're on the road in game three where we're not going to get a lot of calls this game
*  And malone was working the rest but not too much and then on the bench was just just trying to get them to calm down
*  To don't don't get distracted. Just do our thing. We're not going to get calls
*  Don't get caught up in that
*  You know and you could just see he's a real leader and he's you know
*  It's it's what you think about when you think unfortunately about somebody like joe maz who's barely coach
*  And you got malone who's been in the league now for what 20 years?
*  Something like that and has been in all kinds of situations and he knew what was going on in that game before I did with the
*  Just where it was going officiating wives and everything so
*  um
*  the yokich piece of this
*  And I know we're going to be doing a lot of yokich content over the next couple weeks, but
*  I had that 42 club that I started
*  In my book where I was like if somebody if the points rebounds assists in a postseason
*  If you add them up and they're 42 or higher
*  Odds are they were a great player, right?
*  And it's happened way less than you think and the reason I made it 42 is because I couldn't stand carl malone
*  I thought he was overrated and carl malone had a lot of like 41.2
*  And 41.4 so I was like i'm making that to cut off and uh
*  and yoke like i'm trying to find the the list so like
*  In 19 in 2018 lebron for the playoffs was a 50.8
*  So that was I think the highest i've measured
*  Yeah, I think that was the highest i've measured um in the in since like the 80s
*  yokich in this series
*  He's 29.9
*  13.3 rebounds 10.3 assists. So that's 13
*  That the 23.6
*  He's he's over 52
*  Yokich might be starting the 52 club
*  And when you watch him in the games, it actually sometimes seems like his stats should be higher
*  Like I looked up a couple times. I'm like, oh man only 20 12 and 10 right now. It feels like it's a
*  30 25 and 20 i've never seen
*  Anybody just more involved in a positive way
*  With the offense, right? It's just it's just all all additive. It's unbelievable
*  He's so much fun to play with and then the other guys start playing with like them
*  It's so funny to people I think like you and me
*  That the rest of the world the casuals seem to be like, oh this yokich. She's really good, huh?
*  And it's like yeah
*  This is what we were fucking telling you guys for three years
*  This is why we voted him mvp and have jabal murray for two straight playoffs like this is this is the guy so anyway
*  It feels a little victory lapish for me, but i'm taking it
*  I mean he is just a beautiful basketball player and like there's no other way to put it
*  He is a beautiful basketball player
*  i'm sure to play with for all the guys in that locker room because he's so selfless and he just has such a
*  Contagious style and all the other guys that they have the erin gordans the bruce browns those guys like to pass the ball too
*  So I they can relate to him and they they kind of they have the same dna as players
*  He's just got this freakish dna as a playmaker that nobody else on the planet has
*  And the fact that he's doing this at this stage like regardless of the level of defense that he faces
*  It's like he's going his ad
*  ad who has had an unbelievable postseason on defense
*  He's one of the reasons despite his ups and downs and offense and how frustrating his offense has been
*  His defense is the reason why they made the western conference finals
*  He's pulverizing him
*  He's pulverizing the lakers when they have rui or lebron on him with ad coming over and helping
*  It doesn't matter what you do in the bronze fouling him. Lebron just said they turn the fouls off on the broad
*  It doesn't matter
*  Yeah, because he figures it out like he's averaging 10.3 assists to only 3.5 turnovers in the postseason
*  I know he doesn't make many mistakes at all. He makes the right play nearly all the time on the floor
*  He is super efficient from mid-range with those little flip shots
*  He has from behind the arc with those wiro step backs or regular spot ups. It doesn't matter
*  Uh, he he is dirk dovitsky. He is zebo. He is larry bird all in this seven foot
*  300 pound frame
*  Uh, he is he is unstoppable and like I think for the nba
*  I was talking to somebody from the league and they're like
*  He doesn't still he still doesn't want to do interviews and this was during the western conference finals
*  So he doesn't want to do interviews. We gotta figure out. Yeah, we gotta figure out how to market him. I'm like talk about his game
*  Like really but even last night this should have been like yokage day today and lebron hijacked it in 20 minutes with the retirement
*  Stuff and it was like that's it. Yokich. You had your 20 minutes. I uh
*  I
*  I just I think about the guys i've watched in my life
*  Who had that kind of effect on their teammates?
*  And it's really just him and bird of magic that I can remember because even like something like nash nash is a point guard ultimately like
*  He couldn't create his own offense. You could kind of take him out at least a little bit
*  But he was such an unbelievable playmaker and there's been a lot of good point guards who could do it
*  But it's really just bird of magic and yokage. I even lebron as good of a passer as he is. I don't feel like
*  It was never like this. It was
*  You know the conductive the connective tissue that yokage has with his teammates at all times
*  I've only seen it two other times plus bill walton when I was like a little kid
*  And you know, I was seven so I barely remember it but um, it's just such a rare thing to watch somebody
*  Where they're so good at what they do that like erin gordon's making backdoor passes like
*  You you watched erin gordon on orlando nobody was like erin gordon hell of a passer
*  But now because all these guys have played with yokage. They all kind of they think like them. It's it's like this uh,
*  osmosis thing and murray
*  Murray's been the big revelation right because he missed those two post seasons. I remember I did the trade value. I think I probably had him
*  What was that january february? I had him on some terror was maybe
*  Maybe 30 something like that
*  Um
*  Now if you're like, who would you want for a playoff series?
*  He's not one of the first eight guys you take but he's probably on that next list, right?
*  I'm pulling up your rankings right now. Just to double check you hit him 29. So top top 29th
*  Yeah, you had him right behind ingram larry mark and then siakam brunson like you oh my god
*  Yeah, yeah, he's in the teens now. Yeah, no doubt about it. I mean he's he's definitely like that but playoff performance is
*  Is where you?
*  Establish who you are and what your true value is
*  I mean like like you had ingram one spot ahead of him zion one spot behind him
*  Those guys are more theoretical. We saw ingram do it in one series against the sons
*  But it's a first round series when you do it round after round against different defenses different types of defenders
*  And when you're building fatigue playing every other day, that's where you make your name
*  And and yeah establish who you are and jamal murray has done that and he did it in the bubble
*  He has stripped himself of the the bubble murray nickname
*  And rightfully so with his performance now like he I don't know man like that like he he especially but everybody on that team they just
*  They found guys who are all selfless
*  And they're all willing to move without the ball like the two-man game with yokich and the amount of chemistry that they have with
*  The years they've spent together the dho's that they run where they just kind of flip the ball to each other
*  They just have such a feel
*  It's it's like you said they're connected there. It's like their brains are connected. It's my kind of basketball man
*  This is what this is what I love. I'm so glad it's back. I I wonder is yokich a unicorn
*  or
*  Will other people try to start playing like him or is this just like you can't guys from another country you can't this is not
*  Replicable we're only going to get this once you can't play like them. No
*  Yokich just has like when I interviewed him years ago. I think it was 2018
*  When he was still doing occasional interviews
*  I did a story that the kola yokich and in the nuggets funky bunch or something like that was the time
*  Yeah, and like he like I asked him about like do you when with your passes that you make do you practice some of those?
*  Weird angles with your arm or anything like that to make it as pinpoint as it is
*  He was like no, I just my whole life like I just look at something and I throw it there and it goes there
*  It's just something he has on the inside
*  There's something that he has that
*  Nobody really does and like it applies for him as a passer and as a scorer as well
*  Like it doesn't matter if he's looking at the net or somebody's hands spotting out from behind the arc
*  He just knows where to place the ball and he he just has so much foresight. You can't be like yokich. You can't
*  There's a hand-eye coordination. That's just out of control like he had to play in the in the second half yesterday
*  When he was posting up and Gordon cut and he just quick flicked this alley-oop and just put it right next to the rim
*  Yeah, I was just like I
*  Was like wanted to look around in my section. You guys realize how hard that is like that's impossible
*  So he's got that and then the footwork piece of it
*  You know, it's just it the part that's you can't wrap around your head is just like the way he looks
*  Versus what his hand-eye and his footwork is it just doesn't make sense
*  Right. It's like you it's like somebody made him in 2k and thought it would be funny to make a guy that looked like that had his body
*  But then had all these crazy skills and you'd be like, oh look at this guy
*  He had some drop step turnaround shit on Davis
*  I think Davis is probably this when Davis is locked in like he was in the playoffs
*  Probably the single hardest guy to post up when you say is there a harder guy to post up them?
*  And you'll catch a couple times just was able to maneuver around him and get like drop step shit
*  I I was just in awe. It's a really fun team to watch like to me people back
*  Oh my god, Denver. What the hell they to me. This is so similar to that first Warriors season
*  And I think they're even probably more closer to the 2016 Warriors
*  But that first Warriors season we were like really this is gonna happen and then all of a sudden they won the title
*  and
*  even nationally people weren't really totally taking the curry thing seriously and
*  It's just what this reminds me of I I mean they were even odds in the Phoenix series they had on-court advantage
*  Right in this series that they started out minus 140
*  Against this Lakers team with a guy in year 20 as their best player
*  but that line climbed up to minus 160 now it finally seems like they're getting respect, but I
*  Don't know did they throw people off that last month when they went into the funk you think?
*  I think that was part of it for me. I mean I picked against them last round against the Lakers
*  I was skeptical of their chances against the Sun's to with all their
*  Shooting on the perimeter with Katie and Devin Booker like how would the Nuggets defend them?
*  I like yeah, how would this defense translate?
*  But it has translated. I mean like that that like I did a yolk a yolk and defensive video last year
*  You know talking like Adam Montez is like a great Nuggets guy with like DN BR
*  His place is called and like we talked about how he's improved physically his conditioning
*  Positionally like how yogurt has just improved defensively this is last season
*  But then that last month like you don't really know is this him coasting and conserving energy for the postseason or has he hit a wall?
*  So that did play into I think the doubt that I personally had with Denver
*  I can't speak for anybody else, but that was part of it there
*  But they've answered every single question and every round of the postseason playing different ways
*  in each round
*  It's like it's special man like they definitely are special. I can't wait. I really can't wait to see the way
*  You know ESPN ABC and the NBA especially market this guy
*  Because this is the first time a lot of people are gonna be watching him
*  And he does have such a likable game that you can tie to different areas of basketball
*  So will he split the Nuggets win the series the NBA Finals will he explode in?
*  Popularity
*  Nationwide, you know, he's this big seven-foot white dude. He's funny
*  He does have a good personality when you can put a mic in front of his face like you get the he you know ties
*  His wedding ring do his shoes you get the heartfelt stories and all that
*  Second round pick right drafted during a burrito commercial
*  You got a lot of angles that you can that we know about
*  But the casual fan is tuning in for just the finals doesn't know about I just want to know what happens to Yoke itch
*  You know after the NBA Finals if the Nuggets win at all
*  Will he explode and become like one of the real faces of the game even though that is the opposite of what he wants?
*  I
*  Give me it's my wife and two of her friends to go to game three
*  Because we had tickets in the Spotify suite and like just take it there like they're not really basketball fans
*  I'm like just go it's LeBron like he's the second greatest player of all time in
*  Denver as this guy you guys are gonna be fascinated by this guy Yoke itch like I don't care about your kids
*  Just go you're gonna be fascinated by this guy so they all went and then after they were like that
*  Yoke itch what's going on with that guy? He's unbelievable
*  How does he do all that with that body like they were just like dumbfounded by it's passing
*  But it's just I do wonder like from a casual standpoint to me this guy
*  This could be like a pretty long run for him
*  Right because he's got the right supporting cast around him
*  They're in a situation now that if you want to win a ring that's a team you look at
*  It's a team that's not afraid to spend money
*  I think you mentioned the Porter piece earlier and Porter is the all-time hit or miss guy
*  But he's been way more hit or miss now. He's starting to look like
*  What do you think like 610?
*  who
*  610 clay Thompson like something like it in that realm
*  He's in he's in that clay Thompson realm like clay clay prime years could probably do a little bit more off the dribble than
*  MPJ
*  Coming out coming around the screen sideways just fighting threes for sure like he's got to be on the first team sneaky tall guys
*  Where when you see him on the court you're like Jesus Christ this guy's as big as yoga
*  Jizz I didn't realize he was this tall and he is unbothered anytime he gets the ball in his hands and he launches for
*  His three-pointer. It doesn't matter how hard your contest is. He is
*  Unbothered you can be in his landing space and it doesn't matter to him. That's how good of a shooter Michael Porter
*  Is and now he's also a good defender. He's become a good defender. He used to suck on defense
*  He was a negative defender
*  He's become a positive and he rebounds and he competes and he makes the extra pass
*  I mean like Paul, I like I really like his game. I'm with great man. I
*  The the other thing with yokage that I think you really notice in person more than TV is
*  You know, he does those handoff things
*  But he's so big
*  That he just knows exactly how to play in himself in front of these guys and you watch these guys bounce off him
*  And it looks like it hurts
*  You don't feel it on TV
*  but in person like shooters bouncing off him because he doesn't really realize the screens there and
*  he's like going backwards and he's like making a face and
*  You know the way he's just so smart with how he uses body now. We're having a yokage chasm
*  Listen, it's nothing new to us, but it was really fun to watch
*  on a big stage
*  With LeBron, especially last night throwing everything he could and Davis who I thought played pretty well in that game
*  Especially on defense and just they're trying to gear everything to stopping them and it just it just didn't matter
*  There's some bad blood if it ends up being Miami that I'd forgotten about that
*  a lot of people were talking about last two days dating back to the Morris twin and
*  So that could be a feisty series, but I just think physically they don't have anything
*  Close to the the beef to stop that team
*  No, I mean Denver is 6-0 against Miami. I started my research this morning 6-0 against Miami in their last three seasons
*  Yokich has dominated every single you know matchup if you can look at the second spectrum matchup date
*  It doesn't matter what Miami's done against him. He dominates
*  I think it'd be really tough for Miami like BAM is an awesome defender
*  He can so Denver's ready for Miami to close this I think so
*  Yeah, I would think so rather than so there
*  They're gonna pay Jeter and a rod not to go to game five again six and game seven
*  That really was a bad omen for Miami Bill
