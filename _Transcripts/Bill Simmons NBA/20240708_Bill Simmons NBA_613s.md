# Who Should Start for USA Basketball at the Olympics? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4)
*  it'd be really tough for America not to win this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out if there would have to be some sort of ego alpha dog [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=2.24s)]
*  weirdness on the team. I think for them not to. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=6.0s)]
*  Is it Ant? How about that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=8.16s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. Ant says that thing today about they know I'm the number one option. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=10.48s)]
*  I was like, okay, here we go. This could get interesting because [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=14.24s)]
*  I guarantee Embiid thinks he should probably get the ball at the end of games. LeBron is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=17.76s)]
*  wired to have the ball in his hands in big situations. And then [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=22.72s)]
*  it's going to, I think it's going to be a hard team to coach. You have all these, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=26.0s)]
*  you have older players, you have players in their primes, you have players on the way up [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=31.04s)]
*  trying to prove something. And they didn't do the thing this year when they put the two at the end [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=34.24s)]
*  of the bench who clearly aren't playing. Like all of these, like Hal Burton's probably the 12th man [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=39.68s)]
*  on this team now. Albert was in the Eastern conference finals. You know, so I don't, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=44.72s)]
*  I think it's going to be a hard one. Then you have the Kawhi piece of it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Um, there's not a ton of defense once you get past the Tatum Edwards, Drew, Bam, Davis, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=53.04s)]
*  Kawhi, if you want to add the defensive lineup. So I don't know. I don't know how it's going to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=63.6s)]
*  play out. Why are you smiling? So I'm worried about the defense. Then he just went through the guy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=68.4s)]
*  But six guys that probably aren't half of those guys aren't playing at the end of games. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=74.4s)]
*  Like there are BAMs that could play crunch time. Kawhi, I don't know at this point, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=78.32s)]
*  what he will be able to consistently give you. Um, maybe it'll be terrific. I don't know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=84.08s)]
*  but if there was one guy, they're just going to, I'd imagine there's going to defer to the older [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  guys. Has it always been, is this the best example of like an absolute changing of the guard roster? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  Or, well, they had in 92, I guess like maybe Oh, wait, would be the other example. But even [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=103.2s)]
*  then like Kobe was in his prime. Yeah. This is, I guess, cause the guys are so much older now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=112.16s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we have LeBron is almost 40 and the rant, you know, the, you have guys from drafts [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=117.92s)]
*  that happened 20 years ago and 17 years ago might get, here's my starting lineup. Tell me if you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  guys agree with this. Edwards and Curry is the back court and bead is the center. And I think [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=129.84s)]
*  the rant starts cause he has that long Olympics thing. And then the next question for me is, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  is it Tatum or is it LeBron starting? And I can't imagine LeBron not starting. Tatum's not going to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=144.72s)]
*  start. He just won the title. He's in his prime and he's like the perfect international player, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=151.68s)]
*  but I don't think he starts. I think Durant and LeBron start over. So it's and be Durant, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=156.48s)]
*  LeBron, Edwards, Curry, or does Kawhi get the Edwards spot? And they go and be Durant, LeBron, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=161.2s)]
*  Kawhi, Curry. And they don't have a two guard. What do you think Saruti? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=169.04s)]
*  If I'm the Clippers and Kawhi starts for USA basketball, like that's, I'm going to be pretty [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  bummed out. That's not awesome. You lose Paul George and then, you know, watch Kawhi have an [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=179.2s)]
*  awesome Olympics and then gets hurt again next year. That's not what you want to see. So I, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=185.6s)]
*  I don't know. I wouldn't start Kawhi unless he's just unbelievable in camp and we don't know. But [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=188.96s)]
*  yeah, I think, I think Curry Edwards, I don't, there's no way LeBron is the first guy on the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  team and the five. I just, there's no way he's not starting. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. And like, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=197.44s)]
*  you know, it's not an anti Tatum thing, but yeah, that's what I think they go hard. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=202.16s)]
*  First of all, LeBron's going to start and I think Durant's going to start. Just that's going to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  happen. Right. You know what I loved about the pictures, you know, when we first saw the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=210.8s)]
*  Durant picture next to Bosch and you're like, wait a minute, somebody's height is a lie [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=216.48s)]
*  because Durant was that much taller than Bosch. We saw him lined up. Did you see the picture [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=222.96s)]
*  of Tatum next to Bam? Tatum's huge. So I'm glad you noticed this because I noticed this in person. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=227.92s)]
*  I think Tatum's 6'10 now. I do too. I noticed this at the finals going to the games, watching [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=236.96s)]
*  him stand next to different people. And I'm like, there's, it feels like he was closer to 6'11 than [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=242.72s)]
*  6'9. Like he might be like, is he still growing? You think he's huge. I'm kidding about the, is he [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  still growing thing? But whenever these guys are lined up next to each other, I'll look for it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=257.6s)]
*  Like who, cause you know, you think of Bam positionally, it's not like Bam's listed height [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=264.08s)]
*  is wrong. Cause there's a picture of Go Bear and Wemby the other day where Wemby's a full head [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=267.68s)]
*  taller than Go Bear. Somebody's lying. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's because Wemby's the first player [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=273.44s)]
*  I've ever heard prior to the draft that the agents actually were hoping to figure out a way to lie [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=278.24s)]
*  about his height going the other way. Like nobody's ever wanted to be shorter ever in the history of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=283.28s)]
*  the lead up of the NBA draft. But there are people like, he's actually like 7'5, but they want him to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=288.48s)]
*  be like 7'3. And then when he's next to Go Bear. Kareem lied and Bill Walton lied. Kareem was like [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=292.96s)]
*  7'4 and a half. And I think he used to say he was 7'2 and Walton was absolutely at least 7'2. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  Wasn't Porzingis in that category too. I feel like Porzingis, it was like kind of getting weird [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=304.88s)]
*  there at the top. 7'3. What is 7'3? Yeah. He's a legit, he might even be like a whiff taller [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  than 7'3. You're giving him 7'3 and a half, are you? Yeah, I would. But Tatum, there's no way Tatum's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  not 6'10. And I always thought Durant was the other one. I feel like Durant might be like 7'1. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=319.68s)]
*  I think Durant's like 7'1. Yeah. 7'7, 7'8? Yeah. Yeah, like a 7'3, 8', something like that. But he's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=324.08s)]
*  definitely 7'4 over. I don't think he's 7'1. I don't think Bam's listed at 6'9. So as a center, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  you said he thinks that's correct. See, I think Bam's like 6'8. Yeah, there's a good chance he's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=338.4s)]
*  probably not. See, I didn't look at the Tatum Bam part and go Bam's lying. I just thought, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=342.32s)]
*  I can't believe how big Tatum looks next to him and that he's at least 6'10, at least. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=347.6s)]
*  And it also, when I saw him going up against Gaffer at the post, and it's not like Gaffer [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=353.44s)]
*  is listed at like 6'11. Is Gaffer listed at 6'10? That was the beauty of Tatum. And I'm just going [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=357.44s)]
*  to forever be pissed off about Jaylen Brown getting both conference finals MVP and NBA finals MVP, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=364.0s)]
*  because it's not something that I'm upset that Jaylen Brown has. Just seeing what Steph had to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=369.76s)]
*  deal with and all the bullshit post 2015 until he finally got here seven years later, when in fact, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=374.64s)]
*  Curry was the guy that was making all of this stuff happen. For Tatum to be playing point guard [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=380.64s)]
*  for as much as he was, and then also defending centers throughout the playoffs. And he was the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=385.52s)]
*  most important player, even with the bad shooting stretches that he had in the finals. But the first [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=391.2s)]
*  impression with the finals part of it was just going to be such a favor of Jaylen, which is fine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=398.64s)]
*  But watching him physically and then seeing that picture, you're like, are we talking about a 6'10 [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=403.6s)]
*  guy that's playing point guard in the NBA finals that's defending centers? Is Tatum underrated, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=409.92s)]
*  Bill? Well, this is what we talked about during the playoffs, is whether there was another stop for [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=415.36s)]
*  him. I always feel like it's the physicality that's the next piece for him. And not taking [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  step back. Yeah. And that eight to 12 range would be the right deal for him. I will say really quickly, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  if you're putting together the five that just on paper you think works the best together, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=432.0s)]
*  I think you can make an argument Tatum over KD is actually the right basketball move, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=436.64s)]
*  All right. So let's do this as an exercise. Your five guys. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  If it was just like, who are the best five guys we have to close games with that you would trust [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  the most? Cause to me, Tatum has to be over Durant because of his two way ability at this point. And [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=455.12s)]
*  the fact that he's younger, I just think he has to be, and he beat Durant in a playoff series [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=462.48s)]
*  two years ago. I just think he's a better player at this point. I would go and be sure. Yeah. And [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=466.4s)]
*  the games. Well, depending on who the, if it was a team that it was just clearly, it would be easy [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=475.92s)]
*  buckets for him. Uruguay. Yeah. Yeah. He's probably not going to pass, but if we're going [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=481.2s)]
*  for best possible team that could play defense and resemble a finals team, then AD has to be the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=486.24s)]
*  center. Right. So you just changed it at five. I'd go small. I go small. Yeah. I wouldn't play a [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=491.36s)]
*  center. I wouldn't play any of those guys. So would you go Tatum, Durant, LeBron, Edwards, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=501.12s)]
*  Curry, or Tatum, Durant, Booker, Edwards, Curry, or Tatum, Durant, Drew Edwards, Curry? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=505.44s)]
*  Drew is not going to make this closing five in any person. They're going to need him in these [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=512.16s)]
*  Olympics though. Cause I understand. There's going to be a, there's going to be a team where [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=516.8s)]
*  there's going to be some fucking little guy going nuts. And Drew's going to be the guy who's going [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=520.48s)]
*  to have to guard him. You're going to like, Suri, I kind of agree. Like it'd be really fun to just [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=525.28s)]
*  watch five ball handlers out there and see what happens, but there's also going to be a matchup [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=530.56s)]
*  in international play where there's just going to be horrified of Embiid. They're not going to be [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=534.72s)]
*  able to do anything with them. So I think it's Embiid or AD. I like the Tatum. Tatum is like the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=538.64s)]
*  perfect like small ball stretch international five. Has your mood entirely changed as we just [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=543.28s)]
*  theorize on what Tatum might be? You have a pep. You're closing strong. I'm glad that you noticed [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=550.32s)]
*  that he grew. I do think Embiid as this crazy weapon. We haven't had this since Shaq in like [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=556.88s)]
*  1996. Like certain teams are just like, Embiid is just way bigger than everyone on your team. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  He's just going to score every time now for the next, next like five plays. We'll be fun to watch. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. I mean, you're sitting there going like, I don't know if Mitchell Robinson can do it on his [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  own. I'm worried about the Celtics frontline depth. Horford getting a little bit early. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=578.8s)]
*  I'm worried about Belgium. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=582.32s)]
*  Although I don't know off the top of my head with my luck will be like, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=586.96s)]
*  actually Belgium has this really awesome huge guy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's, it might not even be in the Olympics. I don't know. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's a weird team. I wish they had like one more roga, but in general. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9ynHKwUE4&t=597.2s)]
