# SGA’s Game 2 Masterpiece and Summer NBA Chaos Watch LIVE w/ Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU)
*  You [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=0.0s)]
*  All right Sunday night just watched game two [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=30.0s)]
*  Indiana, okay. See I'm sorry Rossello. I thought that might actually be a good game. I was all excited to just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=36.24s)]
*  Say like holy shit [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=44.04s)]
*  We're on pace for an amazing series and all of a sudden halfway through the second quarter [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=46.04s)]
*  That game slipped away and that was it Indiana got the game. They wanted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=51.36s)]
*  One and one heading back to Indiana for game three, but what should be take away from that one? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=56.22s)]
*  Masterful game from SGA. I mean this was the full display of his ability of his understanding his smarts his efficiency [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=63.78s)]
*  I mean the stuff that he was doing he was just in control the whole thing and it was it was just so like [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=71.58s)]
*  Functional, you know, that's the difference like I enjoy the visual of ant more than I do SGA [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  I've never for a second thought it was a better player than SGA [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  But like this is the part where it's just so much of the focus on what he's doing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=85.7s)]
*  Dictating things getting empty on the left side going if you're gonna double me [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=90.54s)]
*  I'm gonna do this to you if you do this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=94.14s)]
*  I'm gonna do this and it was like every single move he made was was just the right one. He was awesome [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=95.5s)]
*  That was my takeaway too, but I do want to thank State Farm for for helping back our little live stream tonight [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=102.9s)]
*  Yeah, SGA was a takeaway I actually felt like they didn't talk about him enough on the broadcast cuz no to me [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  No, just that was I thought they could have done five six more minutes on this guy's just dominating the Pacers [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=116.02s)]
*  They seem fixated on how Albert not taking control offensively. I thought okay see when this game offensively [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  You know, they were they controlled the rebounding in this game last game [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  They didn't SGA was the best player in the court by far [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=132.34s)]
*  They got a really good door game and they got a really good Caruso game [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  And Wiggins and then some Wiggins threes and that's just like that's okay [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=139.82s)]
*  So he has had 30 games that looked like that during the course of the season SJ is awesome three role guys step up [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  they get a couple defensive patches and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=149.96s)]
*  I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=152.66s)]
*  Gotta say I didn't mind how Halliburton played [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=154.1s)]
*  I know I know sometimes it looks a little dicey when you look at the box score at halftime [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=156.36s)]
*  You're like, oh what why is he asserting himself? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=160.8s)]
*  But I think he's one of those guys that just makes the right play a lot and the way [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=163.26s)]
*  Okay, so he was defending him the people that are throwing at him, you know, he's just not gonna dribble into two guys [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=167.78s)]
*  He's not gonna try to take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  24 footers with with two hands in his face, you know in the second quarter of a game [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=175.1s)]
*  He feels it out. He almost almost attacks the game like a hockey player and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=180.42s)]
*  You know, he ramped it up in the fourth quarter [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=186.38s)]
*  But I I certainly didn't think he was the reason they lost did you it was I wouldn't put him in the top five [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=188.38s)]
*  Well, I think he's in the top five you put him top five. I would not [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=194.34s)]
*  I mean five you can come up with five reasons why the Pacers lost this before how they couldn't stop [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=197.92s)]
*  Yeah couldn't stop SGA [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  Roll players couldn't couldn't shoot [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=204.46s)]
*  Second quarter what was it 33 27 and all of a sudden? Okay, so he blew the game open when he was on the bench [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=208.34s)]
*  I thought they didn't control the boards in the same way and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  I really thought they were gonna get something from atherin this game and they did it again and the mat what did Matthew McConnell had 11 [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=219.04s)]
*  Matthew and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=227.44s)]
*  14 but most most of those were when the game was pretty much done but [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=229.0s)]
*  And then top and just had three topping was one for eight [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=233.76s)]
*  So they couldn't get that the bench guys to really get going in the same way. I don't know [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=237.28s)]
*  Okay, so he was gonna win this game it was an easy bet that was why the line was a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=241.84s)]
*  11 and a half heading in there, but I don't know you so you thought you thought there was some blame at Haliburton [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=245.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think it's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=252.04s)]
*  180 and he has two baskets [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=254.04s)]
*  So in the way that we've started to talk about Haliburton the expectations that you're not gonna be invisible offensively [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=255.56s)]
*  And I think you're right that you know, it's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=262.8s)]
*  In the past we talked about like hey [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=266.08s)]
*  Where's this guy and then everything just kind of goes crazy in the playoffs with with how much we adjust some of the ceilings on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=267.8s)]
*  the players [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=272.32s)]
*  And we know that he is he's fully capable of just not having a great scoring game [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=274.24s)]
*  But to your point being very in control of everything that's happening and making the right decisions everything but [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=278.4s)]
*  He just wasn't aggressive at all. Like when he finally had that second make [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=284.0s)]
*  The game basically felt like it was over anyway, and it was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=287.92s)]
*  That might have been the third make but it was just a simple like handoff and then he runs his guy into the handoff for [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=291.68s)]
*  The screen and just gets a little bit of momentum going towards a hoop and hits this floater [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=297.02s)]
*  And you know like alright, you know, where's how hard is it to do that a few more times earlier on? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=300.46s)]
*  I do think with OKC's defense [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  You know [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=308.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm crediting the Pacers and Haliburton and Carlisle for using him off the ball instead of just doing this straight [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=308.94s)]
*  Hey, we're gonna do this thing over and over and over again right at you and then becomes easy to defend especially against this team [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=314.34s)]
*  Meaning the Thunder who they've been defensively, but I don't know. I just would have liked to see him be a bit more aggressive [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=320.58s)]
*  I wouldn't spend an hour trashing the guy because that would that would feel unfair with what he's done [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=325.66s)]
*  But he just yeah, I don't I mean [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=330.54s)]
*  It's just to be like oh you need to do more you need to know shit [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=334.98s)]
*  No shit, he needs to do more but I'm not like mad at him today [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=338.1s)]
*  Right. I thought game five of the New York series. I [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=341.62s)]
*  Thought he was I thought that was a really strange game by him. I [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  Didn't feel like this game was that strange dort was I voted for dort for defensive player of the year [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=349.06s)]
*  I thought dort through everything he had in him [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=353.9s)]
*  It was interesting when they interviewed Jalen Williams at the end of third quarter and they're like, what are you doing? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  No, slow down Haliburton. He's like Lou Dort Lou Dort though. He's going full tilt and then when he comes out [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=359.73999999999995s)]
*  There's Caruso and their entire game plan was like we got to make other people beat us [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  We can't let him get going and also when they were making shots they couldn't run [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=370.61999999999995s)]
*  So, I don't know. I'm sure he'll look at stuff and maybe maybe he'll try to get going in some ways [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=374.26s)]
*  but I thought he took some he took a couple good threes that I thought were going in they didn't and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  The problem for them is when he's not scoring and they're not getting fast breakpoints [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=383.78s)]
*  All of a sudden that starts to we start adding up and it's like shit. How are they gonna get to 110? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=388.46s)]
*  If he's not gonna have points and they're not gonna get fast breakpoints and they're not gonna hit a bunch of threes [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=394.38s)]
*  And that was it. But you know, they got the game they won now. Okay, so he gets to go back to Indy [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  that indie game three is gonna be [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=404.94s)]
*  you know, I'm sure all the Indian legends will be there the crowds gonna be crazy and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=408.05999999999995s)]
*  We we've seen okay see on the road. They'll go a little sketchy [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=413.78s)]
*  Sometimes you know, they're a different team at home than on the road. So if I'm in the end, I'm like we're good [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=417.46s)]
*  We've got three games at home. Let's do this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=422.9s)]
*  Did you see any adjustment stuff from okay see other than they played? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=426.05999999999995s)]
*  Seemed like they played the bigs a little bit more but it wasn't like dramatic homegrown played 27 heart and steam played 22 [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  So they never went super small. I don't think other than that. I didn't really say anything [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=438.02s)]
*  Yeah, I love the heart and Stein minutes again, I liked him in game one and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=442.14s)]
*  You know, there's a couple things I was looking for and I thought the double big stuff really work [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=446.3s)]
*  I mean they were a disaster on the boards in that first game and the Pacers had 56 boards [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  They were plus 17. They hold them to 35 boards granted better shooting as well, but a minus eight for the Pacers on this one. So [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=455.41999999999996s)]
*  There was how much he wants to do the double big stuff [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=463.26s)]
*  It seems pretty clear and this is the other thing that I saw in that last regular season game is that I don't know [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  Okay, see is worried about heart and Stein being a target for all of these different guys that are really good with a ball in their hands [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=470.62s)]
*  You know, it's like four different guys if if they feel like if they go double big then it's a real concern [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=476.34000000000003s)]
*  What's gonna happen with see Ockham? I imagine is is part of thinking about it [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=481.5s)]
*  But you know, sometimes when we think about different roster options and which five guys you want out there [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=485.1s)]
*  we only think of the downside to what those things can be and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=490.3s)]
*  I liked the minutes tonight from those guys and they didn't you know, that was another thing that I thought was really good [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=494.7s)]
*  You know, that was another thing with with game one. I thought he brought back SGA a little late tonight [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=499.82s)]
*  It didn't really matter. He brought him in two minutes after Halliburton [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=504.58s)]
*  And I thought Carlisle I talked with legs about it [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=508.18s)]
*  Like Carlisle was probably thrilled that they went small to close the last three plus minutes in game one being like alright great [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=510.94s)]
*  Cuz now we don't have to worry about miles Turner being a target as much even though Turner was kind of like their offensive plan [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  It felt like for much of the third quarter [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=522.52s)]
*  So [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=524.06s)]
*  By that point the game didn't really matter to see if they were gonna experiment with something small again [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=525.18s)]
*  And you're right about the pace thing like the Pacers always have [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=531.3399999999999s)]
*  Like this Nick series versus this series [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  It looks so different because the Knicks could not ever figure out a way to adjust to the transition part of it [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=538.3s)]
*  Yeah, and that transition part of it through these two games. I think it's concerning. It's great. They got the split obviously [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=543.9799999999999s)]
*  You know there are huge underdogs in this but have you felt like at any point during these two games where you're like [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's Indiana like out rushing and and just fly and get in those easy buckets and the defense is scrambling like it's just something [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=555.74s)]
*  I thought about is this one went fine on like I don't [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=563.0s)]
*  Don't really remember any part of this offense in the last two days [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=565.3399999999999s)]
*  Our last two games where it felt like it was just so unrelenting because of their pace [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=568.86s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the thing with Halliburton like he's not like a mega usage guy [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=573.42s)]
*  You know and if if he misses a couple shots early and if he's not gonna run the ball in the fast break [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=577.4200000000001s)]
*  It's not like he's gonna figure out how to get 20 shots. So it's some way SJ would I'm with you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=583.5s)]
*  There was a couple moments when they ran when they actually had like lanes and you're like, oh there it is [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=588.74s)]
*  But I really think okay sees entire game plan is for that not to happen [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=595.0200000000001s)]
*  You know, they're just they're sending multiple dudes at Halliburton and they don't they don't want Indiana run [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=599.7800000000001s)]
*  And when Indiana runs, they're a different team. I think at home they're gonna be able to run probably a little bit more [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=605.9s)]
*  I bet that so I like I was with you on the double bigs and they only did it [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=611.26s)]
*  It felt like for maybe four or five minutes [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=615.34s)]
*  But in those minutes, they just seem huge compared to Indiana because Indiana is not a big team [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=617.5s)]
*  I wonder [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=622.6999999999999s)]
*  Conversely with Indiana are they gonna go super small and try to have like multiple guards and multiple handlers like will they play? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=624.5s)]
*  McConnell Halliburton and them hard at the same time shit like that to try to make it a little more [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=631.38s)]
*  Chaotic and track meaty trying to think of what adjustments they would do. I [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=637.1s)]
*  Think you're in a lot of pro you're good if you're that small though, man [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=642.0600000000001s)]
*  And even like to the Pacers small lineup [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=645.86s)]
*  It's not necessarily that small because top and Siakam are probably the preferable five [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=648.7s)]
*  Depending on what they want to do with the rest of the guards [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=655.14s)]
*  But you know, okay sees a big team and even though Caruso and Wallace are their smallest guys [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=657.18s)]
*  They're just such badasses and they're so strong [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=663.1s)]
*  Caruso's in on everything like that stuff when the game starts to get to a point where like other guys are tired [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=666.62s)]
*  And then he's just on the baseline and it feels like he's just everywhere and everybody's forgetting about him and how hard he's fighting for [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=671.46s)]
*  Position and right. I mean like this last second little thing. It's just you know, it's all over the court [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=677.9s)]
*  Sometimes all of the rim. Yeah in the corner then he's under the rim again. It's like, how'd you get over there? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=683.18s)]
*  I also feel like and I don't I don't care who wins this series [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=688.5s)]
*  I'm amazed by how much he gets away with with the hand checking and stuff [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=692.62s)]
*  he's just [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=697.2199999999999s)]
*  The way he uses his hands. It's got to be so frustrating to go against him because like everything's a foul [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=698.7399999999999s)]
*  So nothing's a foul, right? He's just he's establishing contact and he's just that's what he's doing [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=704.0999999999999s)]
*  And it's really effective and then they you know Wallace is [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=710.3399999999999s)]
*  Another one who's a little bit handsy Dort is just like built like a fucking football linebacker [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=713.9799999999999s)]
*  I [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=719.54s)]
*  Can't imagine Hal Bern's having a great time in this series even the game-winning shot. He hit a game one [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=720.74s)]
*  That was not an easy shot [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=726.64s)]
*  I it was funny because we went right after the game and I only saw that play and then we were running on [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  There were so many fascinating wrinkles to that last play [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=733.38s)]
*  Where they it seemed like there was a split second where he could have backdoored to see Akam for a game-winning layup and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=736.5s)]
*  Caruso was kind of frozen by the possibility of it, but the shot he ended up making [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=742.26s)]
*  It's so weird to see somebody they think they're gonna pass and then shoot at the last second [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=747.06s)]
*  But my point is nothing's nothing's coming that easy Tim. Do you think okay? See has this has those first two games changed? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=751.7399999999999s)]
*  Any opinion you had on this series? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=759.38s)]
*  You know, I think the only thing not really so the simple answer is no [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=762.42s)]
*  I thought it was gonna be really hard for the Pacers to solve this defense four times for four wins in a seven game series [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=766.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=772.62s)]
*  With what the Pacers have done here historically with these comebacks and what is it eight and one in clutch game? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=774.3s)]
*  So of course tonight doesn't get into the clutch category [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=780.9399999999999s)]
*  The only thing you were thinking about in between game one and two at least for me, you know [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=784.6999999999999s)]
*  I'll ask you but it was is there gonna be some weird like the Pacers are just more comfortable in [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=788.8199999999999s)]
*  this spot [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=795.74s)]
*  Because it seems a little silly to be like, you know the Thunder were young and this is still sort of new to them [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=797.86s)]
*  And it's like well, you know, it's not like the Pacers have been in seven [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=802.6s)]
*  Eastern conference finals here. This is this is exactly like this hardened team [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=806.7s)]
*  Even though they made it to the Eastern Conference finals last year [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=811.74s)]
*  So they make it one more round and so I was I was letting those thoughts enter my head [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=814.06s)]
*  but I never felt like conclusive of going does Indiana have this like [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=818.06s)]
*  Intangible [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=823.34s)]
*  Advantage that's hard to describe other than there's just certain teams that look comfortable in these moments and in other teams that don't [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=824.98s)]
*  It's so funny. You mentioned thoughts creeping in your head [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=833.1s)]
*  Look about halfway through that first quarter when it was going back and forth and okay [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=836.82s)]
*  See looked at a bit frazzled and the pace was a little chaotic [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=840.9s)]
*  but Indiana seemed really comfortable with how it was going and I started thinking like [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=843.78s)]
*  Maybe they just love the speed and physicality and everything of an okay [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=849.5s)]
*  See series in a way that other teams seem to eventually shrink from it. Like maybe this is just [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=854.26s)]
*  Maybe they're just finding themselves. Maybe this team is just [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=859.62s)]
*  Hitting some gear and that there's been examples in history [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=862.98s)]
*  Like I remember an oh four with the Pistons as that Pistons Lakers series went along you could kind of feel them growing into [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=867.26s)]
*  Just the dominant team and same with the Spurs against the Heat 2014 [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=873.86s)]
*  So I didn't I did I was watching going, huh? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=878.08s)]
*  Maybe Indiana is just awesome, you know, and then all of a sudden they're down 15 in the second quarter. It's like, okay [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  Some still still some limitations here. I [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=887.64s)]
*  Still think okay, so he's gonna win the series. I think [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=890.84s)]
*  It's staying on the books agree the home part of this and I'd love to know the updated odds [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=894.0400000000001s)]
*  when you get those but [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=900.4000000000001s)]
*  If you think of like the two things that have happened for these two teams to be meeting for a championship [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=902.6400000000001s)]
*  Okay, see has been destroying teams at home. So what happened tonight is actually very normal [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=907.8s)]
*  I mean they beat Memphis by 50 [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=914.88s)]
*  They they lose on the only other game that they've lost at home now [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  So they've lost two playoff games at home to really dumb last ten seconds of the game [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=922.36s)]
*  So it's the Aaron Gordon [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=927.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=929.06s)]
*  Everything else has been double figures and then the only lead the Pacers have in game one is when Halliburton hits it with point three [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  Seconds left. Yeah, so [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=935.84s)]
*  Those are probably more [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=937.76s)]
*  Anomalies than some of these other games they have on their resume [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  Like whether it's you know, they have this game two against Denver. They beat them by 43 in game two [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=943.96s)]
*  They kill them in game seven, you know, they they put it to Minnesota in those third quarters [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=950.2s)]
*  They play that epic game at Minnesota in game four and win that one and then it's like, okay [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=955.4s)]
*  Well, what kind of fight does Minnesota have and then they lose by 30? So there's just some [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=960.32s)]
*  Serious ass-kicking that happened especially in that place. Yeah [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=965.1199999999999s)]
*  So tonight tonight, I guess you could argue kind of both games make sense [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=970.2399999999999s)]
*  Because of what the Pacers have done and what the Thunder have done. So we're at 1 1 3 minus 560 [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=975.4799999999999s)]
*  Here's my sports radio topic for you. Oh [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=983.2399999999999s)]
*  nice [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=986.64s)]
*  Is the NHL finals officially more interesting than the NBA finals this year because the NHL finals [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=988.48s)]
*  Have been unbelievable [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=995.96s)]
*  That game that came to the other night [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=998.32s)]
*  Was out of control that was one of the best [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1001.96s)]
*  Finals hockey games I've watched and there's so many storylines in Florida [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1004.7600000000001s)]
*  It seems like they have every annoying guy in the league. They have like an all-star team and then you have McDavid [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1008.3000000000001s)]
*  that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1014.5600000000001s)]
*  assist he had [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1015.6s)]
*  In the in the first period when he basically juke two guys and got it to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1017.04s)]
*  To LD for the old goal there. I just I don't know [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1022.52s)]
*  It's it's been an amazing series and you're watching that it's like two teams at the peak of their power [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1026.48s)]
*  It's like McDavid the best probably the best NHL player who hasn't won the cup like ever and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1031.2s)]
*  Then you have this Florida team that has a chance to go back to back and has all these great players on it [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1036.2s)]
*  And then you watch this. Okay, see Indiana team where it's like, okay see [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1041.84s)]
*  Probably not the team they're gonna be two years from now. They'll probably be even better in [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1045.3200000000002s)]
*  2027 and then Indiana who's just having this kind of miraculous crazy run and it just seems way more I [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1050.4s)]
*  Don't know just random then that Florida Edmonton where you're like, holy shit. This is this could be one of the defining NHL series [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1057.92s)]
*  We've had [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1064.4s)]
*  That's my that's my case [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1066.0s)]
*  I've loved these two games as I expected to love them [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1067.88s)]
*  So, yeah, I've enjoyed the cup final more than the NBA finals. It's not even close [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1071.5s)]
*  No, but I think when we get to Indy, I think the NBA finals can rise up [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1076.94s)]
*  The other thing that's a very selfish reason is there's nothing like watching a sporting event and not having to have any fucking takes [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1082.8s)]
*  You like the relief yeah, it's awesome. I don't take notes. I don't know what the hell's going on [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1091.7s)]
*  So I was just like this is fun like I'm just going to sit here and enjoy the sport because I'm dropping in [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1098.2s)]
*  So I feel like I'm like it's almost like voyeurism. I'm just like, alright, I'm gonna hang out here in the bushes and [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1106.4s)]
*  And watch what's going on. I thought that with the French open the last few days, too [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1112.48s)]
*  I just hopped it. I watched creepy bill. I watched the third fourth and fifth sets from hiding behind a tree [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1116.8600000000001s)]
*  I was just like this is the best shot making I've ever seen in my life [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1124.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean it's not quite so it's a little different than you know [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1127.64s)]
*  You have a little more chances to have rallies and stuff, but holy shit. Yeah. Holy shit. Was it great? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1130.56s)]
*  Well, what's what's the storyline like play it out like what for which one? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1137.2s)]
*  There's is there anything I mean certainly you would say hey SGA cements his place in this game [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1141.96s)]
*  I think that's why people are struggling with this series because if okay see wins that the takes are [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1147.8s)]
*  Is this the start of like a little mini dynasty you started you can go backwards and you're like is this like [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1153.72s)]
*  2015 Warriors is this 2000 Lakers as you go through these these teams that have these half-decade runs [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1160.92s)]
*  Just the start of that if Indiana wins, it's the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1167.68s)]
*  Probably the single craziest champion [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  We've had since you and I have known each other [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1174.48s)]
*  You'd have to go back [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1177.32s)]
*  maybe you'd have to go into the mid 90s Rockets that one year when they were like [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1178.46s)]
*  Were they like 40 the back-to-back the second was the first season one of those seasons? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1182.4s)]
*  They were just underdogs in every series and somehow one, you know, but at least they had a keem. It made more sense clutch city [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1187.16s)]
*  Yeah, wait, so [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1193.28s)]
*  Well, how would a Pacers championship compare to Dirk's? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1195.76s)]
*  championship against the heat [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1199.32s)]
*  Well, Dirk was an all-time great player [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1202.08s)]
*  So at least like in in the way we look at basketball in the way we've learned about basketball [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1204.32s)]
*  It at least makes some sense [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1210.28s)]
*  Indiana winning were you said it yourself like like you're still struggling whether Halbert is the top 10 player or not [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1213.64s)]
*  Because he's on all the list now and you're like, all right, if he's a top 10 player [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1220.56s)]
*  Why did I forget he was out there for the first half of game two of the finals? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1224.16s)]
*  I [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1228.68s)]
*  Don't know. It was just the oh four Pistons would be the only other one but that team had [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1230.28s)]
*  Just that that starting five was almost their superstar identity [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1235.88s)]
*  You know, and what do they make eight or excuse me? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1239.64s)]
*  Was it six Easter Conference finals in a row right that Detroit team? So but they were huge underdogs in oh four [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1242.52s)]
*  I think they were yeah plus 400 no doubt. I'm not handing the title of the Lakers [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1248.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not saying that wasn't really surprising [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  And maybe this is year two of like the Pacers being in the Easter Conference finals a bunch of years in a row [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1256.96s)]
*  Like it's it's certainly not impossible, especially when you start thinking about what these could look like after this summer [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1262.92s)]
*  Hmm, but you know if anyone's gonna be left [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1269.24s)]
*  We might not have enough guys for an all-star team in the east [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1273.6s)]
*  The storyline clean house and if Yannis goes west, we're gonna be a major trouble. I know right I [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1277.04s)]
*  Mean the Knicks are still gonna be good. I think Cleveland's still gonna be good, but whatever [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1284.4399999999998s)]
*  I think we've already done this before but you know how like storylines like one of the biggest reasons why people got in it [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1288.1599999999999s)]
*  F1 is because of the storylines because now you had this familiarity with these characters. It was this [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1293.4399999999998s)]
*  Very elitist kind of world, you know [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1300.8s)]
*  Kevin Clark writing about it [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1304.1999999999998s)]
*  He's like the drivers are like good-looking and all the locations are like the best places in the world [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1305.9199999999998s)]
*  And so there's this almost like lifestyles the rich and famous element to when you would get into F1 [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1310.52s)]
*  But the biggest thing was and what every league is always hoping to do is can you make a connection with the fans? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1316.24s)]
*  So they now care about the outcomes of these games because there's some attachment, right? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1321.24s)]
*  yeah, and it made me think about hockey like sure I want McDavid to get a cup because [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1326.12s)]
*  He is that special and I I hate it when the great ones don't [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1331.76s)]
*  Have it and there's this like it like I would have been furious if Pedro ended up without a World Series like that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1337.1599999999999s)]
*  Would have bothered me, you know, I probably eventually would have gotten over it and gone off in a retirement been okay, but [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1342.6999999999998s)]
*  Even even players I don't like you know, like I don't know their chance you have a gym when you're retired you'll be probably [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1348.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know found the youth [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1355.32s)]
*  You know even Barry Bonds like there's something to be said of like I I still wished he had won [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1357.6s)]
*  Was in 2002 is the Angel Series. Yeah, right. He did everything he could have possibly done [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1364.8s)]
*  Yeah, but and that's my day at that time 20 years ago [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1370.52s)]
*  I was rooting for bonds because I was like I wanted to be recognized and it's the same kind of thing with McDavid [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1374.24s)]
*  but then you add in the rematch and the down 3o last year and just I [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1379.32s)]
*  Mean, I don't know that I care about any of the storylines other than and this also could be what's happening in me [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1383.0s)]
*  like I even messed around with a soccer match today after the tennis because [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1389.3400000000001s)]
*  It's same thing with that one. I know we've talked about it a little bit is I'm enjoying [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1394.44s)]
*  Sports that are not disrupted and hockey is not disrupted for these really really long stretches [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1399.0s)]
*  and you're just watching guys play and [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1405.76s)]
*  Unfortunately with basketball and football the ends of these games that hold dramatic like tension edge of your seat because you're actually [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1408.68s)]
*  Constantly getting a chance to like reset emotionally and in hockey you don't have any time [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1416.28s)]
*  Like you're afraid to even look at your phone for a second when we had what we had on Friday night [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1422.32s)]
*  So I love the sport. I don't talk about it very much [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1428.6s)]
*  But because again, I don't really feel all that comfortable talking about it because I'm not that versed on all the minor details of it [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1433.08s)]
*  But I yeah, I mean, there's no question. I've enjoyed those two games more than games one and two of the NBA finals [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1439.0s)]
*  I was at a birthday party Friday [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1443.56s)]
*  There was no TV on and it was like an outside backyard, but they had a TV [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1446.04s)]
*  So I made I made the host put the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1450.44s)]
*  Hockey game on like you put it on see finds it puts it on and like nobody else at the party cares [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm like, it's third period. We got a I need a couple people like we got a and within I don't know two minutes [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1459.8400000000001s)]
*  There was like five five guys just kind of like riveted by it because it was it's that kind of finals [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1467.68s)]
*  And then every once in a while McDavid just goes really fast [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1474.16s)]
*  It's so funny people who know nothing about hockey are like what's the deal that guy? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1479.88s)]
*  Why I see so much faster than everybody else and say that's McDavid. He's probably the best player [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1484.44s)]
*  Pressed offensive player the Leagues ever had since Gretzky [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1490.0400000000002s)]
*  And go fast, but no, I'm with you on there's nothing more exciting than him going fast [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1494.16s)]
*  He doesn't even have to do anything and I get so excited [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1498.48s)]
*  Once he just decides I'm gonna go faster than everybody else [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1502.4s)]
*  I like when they run the play where it's it's like [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1505.5600000000002s)]
*  No [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1509.3600000000001s)]
*  They they're in their own end and they almost do like like it's like an inbounds play in the NBA when they have the guy [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1510.3200000000002s)]
*  Running full speed but they'll do it just to try to create space so he can heat up fast and go fast and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1516.4s)]
*  He just flies and it's really fun. He goes so fast that you almost wonder [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1523.0800000000002s)]
*  Could he go just like in video games? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1528.2s)]
*  Could he just go around the net and just wrap it around and they wouldn't even know what happened [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1530.68s)]
*  Anyway that game went in a double overtime and it's interesting because March and he's on [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1534.7199999999998s)]
*  He's not Florida. They trade the conditional second round pick for him and it activates if they make the round three [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1540.6s)]
*  Which they do and then you know [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1547.6399999999999s)]
*  He comes up massive and now he has the third most playoff goals ever it was hard not to [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1549.6799999999998s)]
*  Hard to root against him. I don't even know who I'm rooting for I bet on Edmonton for the series [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1555.0s)]
*  But it's hard for me not to root against him [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1558.74s)]
*  What I love about Florida is how many annoying guys they have I think they might have broken the record [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1560.98s)]
*  They have the most guys who will do something cheap right after the whistle that I've ever seen in my life [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1565.58s)]
*  It's like whistle and then Bennett's just like elbow somebody's side of the head what I didn't do that. What do you mean? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1571.58s)]
*  But yeah, it's a really good series. I think it's a good point that you made about [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1578.78s)]
*  The storylines thing because it is one of these [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1583.7s)]
*  Everyone's gonna just point to the ratings because the ratings would be terrible tonight, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1586.7s)]
*  It's it'll be like oh, this is the worst Sunday night rating we've had since so-and-so because the game was decided the third quarter [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1590.32s)]
*  You know, it's two small markets [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1599.32s)]
*  It's two teams [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1601.68s)]
*  We don't have a lot of familiarity with and it's a league that we've talked about many times in this podcast that has refused to push [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1602.6399999999999s)]
*  The next generation of teams because they're just putting the old stars on over and over and over again in the biggest spots [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1608.56s)]
*  These are two teams that we knew were good [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1615.08s)]
*  Heading into the season. Okay. See was on TV [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1618.04s)]
*  Decent amount I don't think Indiana was but you know, you kind of learned these guys through the playoffs [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1622.6799999999998s)]
*  And I don't think the league, you know, if you're gonna criticize the league on anything, it's just [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1629.32s)]
*  Not pushing the younger teams that they know are gonna be good. We knew these teams are gonna be good [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1633.8799999999999s)]
*  And I don't think they were on TV enough would that have changed the rating? I have no idea [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1639.12s)]
*  Probably not probably no, no, because I mean as great as SGA is and you know, I think tonight was really special [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1643.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was a really special game that it wasn't just the scoring it was like [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1650.72s)]
*  Okay [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1655.24s)]
*  This guy's at another level than the other nine guys whoever the other nine guys are that are out there [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1655.52s)]
*  And so it's just nice [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1660.52s)]
*  You know [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1662.12s)]
*  It's nice if they get this to have something like that in this MVP season have that kind of game on his resume in the biggest [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1662.56s)]
*  Spot right and there's still gonna be bigger spots. So we'll see what happens, but he's a really quiet dude [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1667.32s)]
*  You know, he's not [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1672.6s)]
*  He's not going in [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1674.6799999999998s)]
*  Like he's great for franchise to be the face your franchise because you're just not dealing with any bullshit [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1677.08s)]
*  Yes times the bullshit [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1681.8799999999999s)]
*  brings people in [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1684.2s)]
*  and the you know, I think we all like drama and this league has [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1686.12s)]
*  Become so popular in a way that's unlike the other leagues and I'm not I'm not talking about ratings [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1692.32s)]
*  But just like the daily consciousness of it and certainly you and I are far too in it [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1697.78s)]
*  so maybe we're not even great gauges with this but the amount of like [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1701.8s)]
*  Nonsense that we spend hours talking about which is actually just good because there's an awareness of this league [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1705.48s)]
*  These are two teams like there's no nonsense and that's awesome for the coaching staff. It's awesome for the locker room [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1711.36s)]
*  but yeah, there's not really this like [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't feel like there's anything necessarily at stake other than the championship and for those secondary viewers [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1721.96s)]
*  There's there's probably just a lot of boredom be like, oh so their best players like [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1728.42s)]
*  Incredibly efficient with pull-up jumpers and the free throw thing hasn't been an issue really I don't think at all [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1732.78s)]
*  I mean the third core is a free throw a free [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1738.9s)]
*  Free throw fest either both going both ways, but you know what I mean? Like there isn't there isn't this like big engaging [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1741.78s)]
*  personality [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1750.6200000000001s)]
*  which again is great if you have to work every day with these people but [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1751.8200000000002s)]
*  The the next day stuff and and getting your mom to be like what's on TV? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1755.8200000000002s)]
*  It's it's not a great matchup for that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1762.78s)]
*  Which we have my daughter my daughter came and watched game two with me and I don't think she looked up more than like five [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1764.98s)]
*  Times she was just on her phone [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1770.18s)]
*  It's just I think that's what it's probably gonna be for casual viewers. It's a good point on SGA [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1772.5800000000002s)]
*  He just does everything really well. He was awesome tonight and [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1777.6200000000001s)]
*  not awesome in like [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1782.02s)]
*  You know, there's those two ways of being awesome in NBA game and he's like in the quiet efficient [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1784.18s)]
*  Almost like a Greg Maddox just getting guys out [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1789.86s)]
*  Not not perfect. I'm doing like the 17 strikeouts [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1793.74s)]
*  Is it did you see that interview with him where he got asked the question and he did the deep sigh and [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1799.42s)]
*  Like search for the answer for like 10 seconds. It was pretty interesting [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1805.46s)]
*  So I forget I think it was Malika the ass upset me just like oh [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1810.18s)]
*  man [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1815.22s)]
*  Like really what wanted to come up with a good answer for it [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1816.42s)]
*  It was just unusual because a lot of these guys are so media trained for moments like that [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1819.18s)]
*  And these guys are still like getting used to being famous people, you know, she's famous. I [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1823.46s)]
*  Don't know but it's a Canadian star who's been in the spotlight for a while, but he's not like famous famous [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1830.42s)]
*  seen a couple commercials now [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1836.74s)]
*  I don't think he's is I don't wouldn't say he's one of the ten most famous players in the league right now [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1839.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's bad if that's your MVP and I'm not being critical of them [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1845.7s)]
*  I just don't know that there's and this becomes like this kind of circular thing where it happens all the time [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1849.96s)]
*  Like I always kind of whether I've joked with you or other people that are in this business with us [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1855.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like no one's ever lost a show because of them [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1859.26s)]
*  They've only lost a show because people didn't do enough to promote it, right? Right, right, okay [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1862.3400000000001s)]
*  You know what that contract I wasn't really into it didn't like the producer. So I was showing up [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1868.3s)]
*  I was giving you like my [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1873.94s)]
*  C-plus game. Yeah, and this oddly feels like I'm sort of saying something about [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1875.7s)]
*  Someone specific, but I'm not I'm not I'm not saying anything specific [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1882.78s)]
*  I'm just saying that that's the norm is as soon as something's over. It'll be like, oh, well, you know [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1885.3799999999999s)]
*  I could have done this or this could be better the whole thing and there there's a member like the baseball stuff [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1890.9s)]
*  It's like baseball's declining because they're not marketing their stars [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1895.94s)]
*  I've heard it with the WNBA like they don't market enough and I always wonder it's like [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1899.26s)]
*  Well, if SGA is this buttoned up [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1905.1000000000001s)]
*  But what are you supposed to do like is it because if okc we're on national TV [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1909.6200000000001s)]
*  12 more times this year would the NBA finals ratings be better and I'm asking I don't I don't know the answer to that [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1915.78s)]
*  but sometimes [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1922.88s)]
*  Well, we just default to this well the league should have done this the leagues do a bad job here [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1924.42s)]
*  And it's like I don't know sometimes people just they're just not interested. They just want to be interested. There's nothing you can do. I [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1929.6200000000001s)]
*  Remember oh seven when LeBron made the finals against San Antonio and we were LeBron. It was still pretty new, right? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1936.38s)]
*  It was like they I think his fourth season [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1942.2600000000002s)]
*  And the ratings for that finals were terrible because it was a mismatch and we didn't have a real history with LeBron yet [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1945.22s)]
*  And then he had his two MVP seasons in 09 in 2010 [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1951.18s)]
*  And that was when it was like gonna be LeBron versus Kobe and that became the storyline and then LeBron [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1955.38s)]
*  Didn't make the finals of the year. It was interesting [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1960.3000000000002s)]
*  He his shoe. I think the biggest selling shoe we ever had was 2011 after the decision [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1963.0200000000002s)]
*  It was like he needed the soap opera the decision to go to that next level [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1970.18s)]
*  For like people like our parents to have opinions on them, you know, maybe SGA [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1975.0200000000002s)]
*  Maybe he needs maybe he needs like a like a career polarization [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1980.18s)]
*  Consultant [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1987.22s)]
*  Yeah, but what's he gonna do with the man? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1988.42s)]
*  Like what could he possibly do like this is this is actually the greatest compliment you can give somebody who's the face of a franchise [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1990.22s)]
*  Is that it's so consistently every day is the same boring. He's just an awesome teammate [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=1996.1000000000001s)]
*  Can all my teammates come in and do my interview with me? I just want to like remind everyone listening [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2003.6200000000001s)]
*  This is not even close to a criticism [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2009.38s)]
*  This is like all you could ever want out of especially somebody this young to be like this guy already gets it [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2011.5s)]
*  And look Jalen Williams did the media availability stuff before the finals even get started [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2017.5400000000002s)]
*  I was listening on NBA radio to his press conference, but I didn't know who it was right away [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2021.9s)]
*  I thought it was like a 45 year old coach [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2026.22s)]
*  Like who is this guy? I was like this guy's really really impressive [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2030.18s)]
*  Yeah, and I had to like hit the screen because it was like, you know [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2033.98s)]
*  Your phone it wasn't coming up right and then boom [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2038.5s)]
*  It's Jalen Williams and I'm thinking my god [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2042.94s)]
*  This guy's been in the league like just a few years and this is what he sounds like already [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2047.14s)]
*  Maybe I see a needs to do a bread. He might mean to do a Brett hitman heart that in the mid 90s [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2052.06s)]
*  What is he was that he was the champ? Well, he was a good guy [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2057.78s)]
*  He was a champ, but he was kind of like, you know, he's just a professional guys very similar to SGA actually just very good [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2061.16s)]
*  Canadian to is a Canadian always good matches and then they kind of leaned into how do we make them a villain and he started [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2066.66s)]
*  Doing this kind of aggro Canadian guy thing and insulting [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2073.58s)]
*  saying how Canada is better than America and then the fans were like what and [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2077.7s)]
*  And that became kind of a thing that became his first night. Maybe that's what SGA needs to do [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2082.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough to play in America when Canada is obviously a superior country [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2088.62s)]
*  She's insulting America, let's take a break for the podcast. We'll keep going on the we'll keep going on and the YouTube's [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2096.82s)]
*  What are your expectations now if you had to say, okay see we'll win the finals in blank games [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2106.06s)]
*  how many games would you say I [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2111.2599999999998s)]
*  Said five maybe it's six, but I I don't see how the Pacers are going to solve this defense before wins. I [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2114.74s)]
*  Don't know who those offensive spark is gonna be [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2123.2599999999998s)]
*  for situations like what happened today when they're able to limit Hal Burton and I [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2127.38s)]
*  Don't it's it have to be like a math or in top and somebody that you mean game one where everybody scored [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2133.02s)]
*  Well, I don't think that's gonna happen again. Yeah, and they were still down 15 in the fourth quarter [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2139.68s)]
*  Yeah, you know they got away with the turnovers because okay see wasn't scoring on turnovers [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2144.88s)]
*  I think it was 11 points off those 25 turnovers and legs and I were talking about it on our pod going like [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2149.16s)]
*  You know how hard it is to only score 11 points off of 25 turnovers that that's harder than forcing the 25 turnovers [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2154.2799999999997s)]
*  Just the anomaly of that and they had such great balance [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2160.64s)]
*  But you know siakam doesn't have a field goal make in the second half a game to granted [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2163.9599999999996s)]
*  He was at the free throw line nine times [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2169.3599999999997s)]
*  So sometimes the field goal attempt make thing can be a little misleading when you're looking at the shot chart after the game's over [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2170.7999999999997s)]
*  But instead of like incredible balance massive rebounding edge hitting the game winner [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2177.12s)]
*  I mean that game was not going their way for two plus hours [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2182.56s)]
*  Until it did and well and then I'm just done it so many times. They were almost like oh, that's not even weird for them [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2186.68s)]
*  It's still kind of weird right well [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2192.44s)]
*  And then the flip side okay see plays like one of the weirder offensive games [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2194.36s)]
*  They put all year where they basically just didn't pass the ball at all [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2197.88s)]
*  Okay, they they made a concerted effort in this game to be like we got to move make the extra pass [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2200.96s)]
*  SGA led the way and that was it I would say I [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2206.44s)]
*  Think Indiana gets one of the two in Indiana [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2210.2400000000002s)]
*  Just because I feel like okay see has looked gamey and some of these rogue games [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2213.48s)]
*  And I think that atmosphere is gonna be awesome, and I think Indiana is good at home [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2218.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think they can get one and I would I had okay seen five [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2222.0s)]
*  I'd probably revise that to okay see in six, but I do not think we're getting seven I [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2226.84s)]
*  Just think okay sees too good, and they really shouldn't have lost game one when you think of it that way right? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2231.7200000000003s)]
*  So I would I would kind of stick in the five to six range for them [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2238.44s)]
*  Yeah, so like like three is now harder for the Pacers because it's one one [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2242.12s)]
*  Then two oh you know if it were two. Oh, I would probably just pick the Pacers in game three [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2246.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know game. I don't know to the Pacers if the Pacers if Halliburton doesn't hit that shot [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2252.0s)]
*  Okay, see wins it do we see a better effort from them, or do you see like there was one possession? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2258.64s)]
*  it was 52 39 and I wrote this one down and [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2263.16s)]
*  At that point had gone from like 23 points to a 13 point lead [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2266.96s)]
*  And you're like man here the Pacers like hanging in there because when it was 23 [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2271.12s)]
*  Okay, see had the ball then they had like a bunch of turnovers multiple possessions [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2274.7200000000003s)]
*  And so the Pacers getting back into the game [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2277.96s)]
*  But there was this stretch where they kept getting offensive rebounds on this one possession [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2280.32s)]
*  But every shot after the offensive rebound was so hard [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2284.06s)]
*  And then I think they ended up either getting free throws or how to make eventually yeah [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2287.4s)]
*  but there was just that moment when you're watching the Thunder swarm and [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2291.42s)]
*  You're like these shots suck like these guys have the ball [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2295.96s)]
*  It's like I guess I'll go now, but I don't really want to take this but right like this is a bad shot because it's so [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2300.44s)]
*  Contested but I don't really know if there's anything better than than what I'm doing and they would take and they kept getting off [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2308.16s)]
*  It's a rebound but like that specific possession [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2314.12s)]
*  I was like man when the when the Thunder get it rolling like this like it's a pretty helpless feeling and then to your point [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2316.2s)]
*  It's kind of like all right is it Siakam? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2321.92s)]
*  Against mismatches you're gonna run a ton of that or you're gonna have Halliburton coming off of curls [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2324.88s)]
*  You're gonna let Nemhar ISO [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2329.0s)]
*  Are you gonna run the post stuff that they did with Turner who they like Turner against chat in the post? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2330.48s)]
*  But nobody does it like nobody goes. Okay, cool. It's chet against Turner for eight minutes [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2335.1200000000003s)]
*  Let's make sure he gets a post touch every time down like NBA teams [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2338.84s)]
*  Just don't even want to do it even when they like their advantage [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2343.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, and then the other thing you get in the paint you think it's a good thing to be in the paint but against okay [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2346.1600000000003s)]
*  See, it's like the sense. Yeah [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2350.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's just that's a great boy these extra hands come out [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2352.8399999999997s)]
*  there was that one when [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2356.3599999999997s)]
*  Halbert beat his guy off the dribble and SGA came from behind him and [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2357.9199999999996s)]
*  Did like the spider-man strip and just got all ball like that. No other team does shit like that [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2361.52s)]
*  Wallace had a contest in the corner where he blocked it and I couldn't believe [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2367.16s)]
*  Against knee Smith. Yeah, and it was yeah, I was like how you block cuz the ball flies out and I'm like what he got [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2373.56s)]
*  his hand on that [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2380.2799999999997s)]
*  Especially when you're thinking of like wall, it's not exactly being the biggest dude out there and he had a make-up ground [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2382.12s)]
*  And it's not even just a contest. He blocks it and I was like this is they have they have possessions defensively where it just feels [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2387.0s)]
*  horrifying [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2394.84s)]
*  It's stupid and if they just run back the team. I [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2396.4s)]
*  Don't know why they wouldn't be a little bit better next year than this year [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2401.7599999999998s)]
*  Because all the all none of their guys are like exactly in their primer past their prime except for maybe Caruso [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2405.84s)]
*  You could argue like maybe he's peaked as a basketball player. This is all we're getting [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2412.2400000000002s)]
*  You could go through every other guy in that team and make a case. They're gonna be like 5% better next year [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2416.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know if they're gonna keep dort [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2421.28s)]
*  I don't know if there's some salary cap mechanics that they have to do and maybe [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2422.76s)]
*  You know, you're bringing in top it top bitch. Whatever his name is the rookie who got hurt [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2426.6000000000004s)]
*  You try to fill his minutes with more Wallace and maybe that's how you save some salary and push it toward Chet and [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2431.8s)]
*  Jalen Williams extensions. I don't know [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2437.44s)]
*  If they don't have to do that for another year, but this is probably the team [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2440.0s)]
*  Florida's minus 115 to win the cup again [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2444.76s)]
*  Edmonton's minus 104. So basically dead even I don't know if you want to put some wood on [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2449.28s)]
*  Or you just did naturally rooting for McDavid. I'm rooting for [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2454.76s)]
*  McDavid and everybody knows so much. I love the city of Edmonton [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2459.4s)]
*  so I was watching PTI before the finals and they had butcher grass on and [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2463.04s)]
*  They was basically like just tell us [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2470.16s)]
*  Give us the storylines for the series and he did this awesome McDavid thing, which I'm sure he's done on TV to about [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2472.44s)]
*  This is the best player [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2480.16s)]
*  ever [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2482.68s)]
*  To have not won a cup yet and it's not close and you go through the history of hockey and nobody has ever been even [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2483.72s)]
*  Close to being as good as this guy who hasn't won yet and this is the moment it's right here [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2489.68s)]
*  They have some salary cap issues next year. It's gonna be much harder with their roster. Like they have to do it this year [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2494.04s)]
*  This is incredible amount of pressure. He has to get it done this year and I was like driving my car [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2500.16s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, he's got to get done. I was like I was like fired up listening to it [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2505.0s)]
*  But this is the this is the moment and there's there's no basketball storyline like that. I don't think [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2509.44s)]
*  In hockey, did you just freeze on me? No, I'm just so enamored with this [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2517.52s)]
*  No, I got worried because I've had weird Wi-Fi locked in [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2522.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's no basketball equivalent of this the only one I get like it's basically like Dirk in 2011 [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2527.2400000000002s)]
*  But if Dirk was the best player in the league for like seven straight years and was in that same kind of Dallas spot [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2532.98s)]
*  I guess would be the [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2538.88s)]
*  analogy, right [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2540.6800000000003s)]
*  Who else would it be in the last 25 years? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2542.6800000000003s)]
*  well, you'd have to be the undisputed best in the sport and [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2546.84s)]
*  As great as Dirk was he wasn't that as much as that LeBron just staying in Cleveland never leaves and now it's like [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2552.04s)]
*  2016 yeah, that's good [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2558.28s)]
*  Yeah, I like McDavid that video last year of him just screaming at everybody in the locker room was one of the best [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2561.6400000000003s)]
*  Best internet locker videos I've ever seen in my life [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2568.32s)]
*  I'm a huge captain guy another fan. Yeah, I don't know if he's any good or not [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2571.72s)]
*  I played golf with one of the retired guys and I was like afraid to go like [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2577.12s)]
*  This captain good [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2582.8s)]
*  You know be like golfing with you be like is Aaron Wiggins a Max Guy bill [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2586.24s)]
*  Is he we try that Baron Wiggins or Michael Porter jr. I'm gonna bring that up again [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2592.28s)]
*  Man [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2598.48s)]
*  I [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2601.36s)]
*  Mean look Michael Porter jr. Is clearly the most talented player right like we don't [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2603.0s)]
*  Sure, there's no debate there, right? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2609.64s)]
*  Okay [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2612.4s)]
*  Wow [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2617.44s)]
*  I think I still take Porter jr. Just because the dribble shot making stuff when it's really good is is bananas BA and AS [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2618.88s)]
*  But we're gonna play we're gonna play a game called. I wouldn't be surprised if dot dot dot [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2627.08s)]
*  Because it is now June 8th. I [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2632.96s)]
*  Think I'm gonna spell bananas [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2635.48s)]
*  four weeks [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2637.6s)]
*  Four weeks from now a bunch of shit will have happened. We will have an NBA champion [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2639.84s)]
*  We will have an NBA draft [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2645.08s)]
*  We will probably have a couple trades in June [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2647.32s)]
*  We will have some free agent signings in July and maybe even some more trades and the league is going to look a [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2649.92s)]
*  Lot different some people are saying it's gonna be the craziest offseason. I can't imagine that I still feel like [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2656.04s)]
*  Heard this a couple times even from people we like like win horse [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2661.64s)]
*  I still feel like the Kauai Paul George Anthony Davis summer to me is the 10 out of 10 for crazy summers [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2664.6s)]
*  I don't know if we're topping that yeah, but Davis was a February wasn't it? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2672.0s)]
*  No Davis that that trade it was in July remember [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2676.2s)]
*  They tried to trade him in February and it didn't go through and then all these Lakers were stuck on the team for the rest [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2680.22s)]
*  After they've been in the trade I [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2685.16s)]
*  Remember yeah, cuz I was I remember just only because it was Super Bowl and I was constantly we were all on like a lower Davis [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2687.56s)]
*  So I thought I forgot about that to me. That's the number one summer tough one to be but anyway [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2693.92s)]
*  You seem to have animosity about expectations that it could be a crazy summer though. That's what I like. I don't know [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2699.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean sure there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that feels like there's possibilities [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2704.36s)]
*  It could for for it to be the craziest summer. I think Yanis would have to move [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2708.7999999999997s)]
*  I think that's that's locked in yeah, and other stuff would have to happen, but we would have to have Yanis a [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2712.92s)]
*  Yanis trade would have to be part of that for that to even be in the conversation anyway [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2719.96s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if dot dot dot give me one [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2724.0800000000004s)]
*  I [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2728.6000000000004s)]
*  Wouldn't be surprised if [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, let me say it this way because I it's not based on Intel or anything, but [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2731.44s)]
*  the Celtics [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2737.6800000000003s)]
*  Clearly have to make moves [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2739.28s)]
*  Because of the finances and it's hard to sign off on a team without Tatum and be like that's fine [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2741.76s)]
*  And then all the restrictions that are involved in a super expensive team without its best player, so I [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2747.7200000000003s)]
*  Don't think like [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2754.52s)]
*  Tanking makes any sense, you know if the Celtics run it back with Jalen Brown and say you know what? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2756.32s)]
*  We get a really good player back in 25 26 probably gonna be a great season [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2760.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's probably the case for almost every team that starts their year [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2764.28s)]
*  It's okay, and we'll figure out a way to cost and move out some players [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2767.12s)]
*  But we still want to be Jalen Brown Tatum having said that if there's an offer out there that makes sense [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2770.88s)]
*  I think that explore it so yeah [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2775.68s)]
*  I guess I wouldn't be shocked if if Brown if they did treat it like a gap year [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2777.16s)]
*  I could I could see the argument for both approaches I [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2781.98s)]
*  Would throw a third approach in what if they just blew it up and I would have been surprised three four weeks ago [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2786.0s)]
*  But I don't think I'd be as surprised now. What's blow it up mean I mean like [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2792.04s)]
*  Multiple trades like they just say fuck it [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2797.56s)]
*  We're we're Tatum's not playing next year when he comes back a year from now [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2800.2s)]
*  We're gonna reset everything and we're gonna have a completely different team [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2804.36s)]
*  So that would be [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2809.72s)]
*  Because what people have been talking about with them or they'll trade drew and or poor Zingas to get into the tax [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2811.44s)]
*  I think the one thing the one thing I would definitely put major money on is that they will shed 20 to 25 million somehow [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2816.96s)]
*  Over the summer, and I don't know how they're gonna do it, but they will [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2823.92s)]
*  I [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2827.12s)]
*  guess the question for them is [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2828.3199999999997s)]
*  could somebody overwhelm them with the Jalen offer especially if Yanis doesn't get traded and [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2830.7999999999997s)]
*  Jalen becomes basically the best guy to get if you're one of those teams that's right here trying to go up a notch and [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  Jalen's probably the number one draft pick at that point [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2843.12s)]
*  So I hope it doesn't happen but it made it I'm starting to get nervous that it might [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2846.96s)]
*  What I like about what you said there though is something [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2852.08s)]
*  I think we've touched on whether it's on this pot or on our own stuff, but [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2854.44s)]
*  Sometimes it feels like you can get a little contagious where you're doing all the work with your staff [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2860.08s)]
*  Ownership is bought into it. It's like, okay [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2865.32s)]
*  We're gonna go get one of these big ticket items and then to your point like you feel like you've done the prep work and [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2867.36s)]
*  Not to say that a Jalen Brown package is the same as a Yanis package [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2871.96s)]
*  But if Durant's available like what's that package look like, you know, what if Yanis pulls us? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2876.48s)]
*  So it's just you feel like you've been prepping for this moment and then all of a sudden Horst and Milwaukee and Yanis and his agent [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2882.04s)]
*  Are like, all right, we're fine and and I'm with you now like I already talked about it [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2888.8s)]
*  How I've changed my mind after the combine where it just felt like there was too much conversation around it where it's like [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2892.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, then if you don't do it this summer [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2898.04s)]
*  You're probably gonna end up like looking at a worse market for him next summer if Milwaukee has a bad season [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2899.56s)]
*  So doing something that I would never want to do and trade Yanis if I were GM it to me [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2906.2799999999997s)]
*  Makes more sense now for Chicago who knows could be totally wrong [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2910.52s)]
*  But if that is pulled off if the Durant thing is already kind of predetermined then maybe you're right [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2912.72s)]
*  maybe there are three or four teams it's like we were ready to like really swing for something and [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2918.2s)]
*  You know the two the two other options aren't available here [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2923.2s)]
*  Does that mean that people feel like they've done enough prep work and there's been enough conversations for that to be something that's easier to [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2926.28s)]
*  settle on well, how many teams do we think are [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2933.12s)]
*  Stepping into the batter's box with their helmet on [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2936.6400000000003s)]
*  Doing the Nomar with their gloves like getting ready to take a couple swings here because to me [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2940.08s)]
*  It's the Rockets and the Spurs are the two I'm watching then everybody keeps telling us that Toronto is [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2944.32s)]
*  Like that too, but I just how are they getting I don't know even if they try to get somebody like Yanis [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2950.12s)]
*  You're trading so much away to get Yanis. He's just basically in the same situation. He's already in on the bucks, right? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2957.0s)]
*  I think that's a huge part of any honest trade is he's got to go to a team that's giving up assets [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2962.74s)]
*  But it's keeping enough of their team that it now makes sense for him to go to that team [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2968.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2972.64s)]
*  And that's where it's the Rockets and the Spurs are the two most likely for me [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2973.4599999999996s)]
*  Because they can trade stuff and they can trade future picks but still keep enough [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2977.4199999999996s)]
*  That they become really interesting with him. The next would be the other team [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2982.4599999999996s)]
*  I think for Yanis which we've talked about before and I know that would involve the Bucks being like cool [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2985.74s)]
*  Carl and Anthony Towns [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2991.5s)]
*  Where do we sign but that and that would have to unfortunately be part of the trade which is probably what wouldn't happen [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2993.1s)]
*  but my feeling is that Yanis stays and [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=2998.5s)]
*  If they decide to do anything they look at December January February when maybe [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3003.58s)]
*  you know by the time we get to December eight eight teams hate their teams and [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3009.54s)]
*  seven other teams are like [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3014.14s)]
*  Are we doing anything and you just yeah [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3018.34s)]
*  Might not have that enough teams that feel that way now, you know, so [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3021.5s)]
*  Unless to me unless it's [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3027.74s)]
*  the Rockets because if I'm the Spurs [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3030.82s)]
*  Like let's talk this out [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3034.34s)]
*  Be this person who had to get a chance to get Yanis and you're basically giving away the number two pick and all [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3036.1s)]
*  this other stuff to put him with Wemby and like Darren Fox basically and [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3041.26s)]
*  We're in the room with the owner [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3046.9s)]
*  Trying to walk him through whether we should do that or not, would you tell him yeah do it because [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3049.38s)]
*  Sometimes I'm out the window is now if you have a guy like Wemby go for it. Go for it. I [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3054.34s)]
*  Think that number two like like people really love Harper people really think he has a chance to be like a special offensive guard [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3059.34s)]
*  You know and and when you think like Wemby's pretty young I [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3067.1800000000003s)]
*  Don't know [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3071.7400000000002s)]
*  Yanis is 31. He's been the league since [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3072.9s)]
*  2013 and I just wonder if the are the timetables kind of staggered a little too much [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3075.54s)]
*  Where's Wemby gonna be a year from now versus five years from now? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3080.34s)]
*  Would it be more fun to just kind of grow into the Wemby team versus to just press the button and go for it immediately [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3084.98s)]
*  Whereas Houston I think is in a different spot [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3090.82s)]
*  It would be so much fun just to see how the Wemby Yanis piece fits together [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3094.98s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3099.66s)]
*  Imagine them put like playing Indiana right now in the finals. They're like, yeah, they're having trouble [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3102.02s)]
*  Trouble driving to the paint against Wemby and Yanis [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3107.5s)]
*  Indiana is gonna go to a zone here, I guess [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3112.7799999999997s)]
*  They're they're unveiling their Tony Bradley Thomas Bryant miles Turner lineup [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3117.66s)]
*  It's having it is James Johnson again put it hoping to go to Yanis into a fight [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3122.54s)]
*  I don't know. So would you tell them? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3128.14s)]
*  Would you tell them slow play this or would you tell them it's Yanis? You got to go get him [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3132.06s)]
*  If they're sold on Harper [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3139.5s)]
*  Then you know the contractual control and all kind of stuff [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3141.58s)]
*  But sometimes I think we make this really complicated like if you have a chance to get Yanis [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3144.1s)]
*  And this is why I think these teams do this as often as they do and maybe it's changing a bit [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3147.3799999999997s)]
*  With the financial restrictions, but again, we'd have to see this play out for multiple years before I think we have any kind of answer [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3151.54s)]
*  But you've talked to enough of these guys that run these teams like you hope at one point in your life [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3157.36s)]
*  You get a fucking player as special as Yanis on your roster [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3163.64s)]
*  I think we're gonna say Wemby when you set that set it's a [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3167.56s)]
*  Yeah, okay, whatever when be ends you might you might end up with two of those guys at the exact same time [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3170.7599999999998s)]
*  right in the spurs you could say we've actually had like four of them, but I [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3175.64s)]
*  Don't think people can help themselves. I don't think people can say no [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3181.12s)]
*  When Yanis is available like to think of that actual call where it's like, okay, we would we would do this [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3186.0s)]
*  Now spurs ownership feels like they've had so much success [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3193.1s)]
*  Certainly pretty buttoned-up place [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3197.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe maybe they don't maybe they're the outlier that's like no we kind of like the way we do things [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3200.7999999999997s)]
*  So that would be the what would Sam Presti do you be it's the old what would Belichick do now? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3206.3999999999996s)]
*  It's what would Sam Presti do Sam Presti would not trade for Yanis [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3211.2999999999997s)]
*  I [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3215.68s)]
*  Think he would rather build around the assets and build around Wemby and tried to build a sustainable [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3217.2s)]
*  Decade around a guy versus like going for the kill quick [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3221.56s)]
*  Yes, I mean it's right yeah, but I [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3227.08s)]
*  Think you have to have a certain level of juice [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3231.4399999999996s)]
*  You got to have some kind of equity in your city as a franchise and you have to have that kind of equity with ownership [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3233.64s)]
*  For you to be able to tell the owner who's ultimately saying yes or no to all this stuff [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3238.68s)]
*  Like we shouldn't do this [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3242.96s)]
*  We shouldn't grab and as expensive as Janice is on on the north side of 30 and some of the injuries fine [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3244.96s)]
*  But it's Wemby's contract coming plus you got to pay Fox next year [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3251.56s)]
*  So now you have three max guys, which is death with the second apron system [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3255.3599999999997s)]
*  That'd be the reason not to do it [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3260.0s)]
*  I mean, how would you handle it if you owned a team and they were like hey [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3261.8399999999997s)]
*  We just got off the phone Milwaukee like we can have the second or third best player in the world on our team [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3265.74s)]
*  I would so if I'm the Spurs owner I [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3270.58s)]
*  Would be absolutely obsessed with with trying to figure out how good Harper can be I [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3275.14s)]
*  Would have a whole wing of my front office just crunching Harper tape [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3282.02s)]
*  Studying interviews every piece of it because if he has a chance to be either special or close to special [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3287.94s)]
*  I think that changes the equation. This is not like the Lakers [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3293.9s)]
*  Trading for Anthony Davis and the fourth pick in the draft and it's Deandre Hunter. It's like fine take them, you know, this is [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3297.94s)]
*  If this guy could be like a special running mate with Wemby and that'd be two years apart basically and you would have them [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3305.5s)]
*  Just kind of ascending together and it's I and they I've heard this stuff about well, that's would be weird with him and Fox [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3311.22s)]
*  That's like fine trade Fox if Harper's special like you you'll have moves [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3317.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not like you're stuck with whatever team so so it would that would what would become that could I get somebody really special [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3321.94s)]
*  With the second pick in a draft that everybody loves and if I feel like I could what kind of time table am I with? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3329.04s)]
*  Wemby, when do we think Wemby could be? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3334.46s)]
*  Somebody who could be in the finals as the best player in the series or one of the two best players [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3337.34s)]
*  Is that two years away is it three years away? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3342.02s)]
*  Yanis does I mean Yanis has a lot of games and some miles on him [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3344.5s)]
*  That would be the other thing I would worry about with tall guys as they hit their early 30s [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3348.06s)]
*  The history of that I would do be doing studies on that [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3353.22s)]
*  Every seven foot and up guy from age like 31 on what happened to them? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3356.78s)]
*  But if I'm Milwaukee, I'm that's my dream trade right can I get the number two pick can I get [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3363.1s)]
*  Then the cell and Harrison Barnes and some future picks like that's that would enable me to do a real reset and build around somebody [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3368.94s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing that sucks and why [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3376.18s)]
*  If you're Milwaukee you're like, okay, we're getting their picks [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3379.9s)]
*  But it just sucks to go through your own rebuild without your without your picks, but you think maybe we'll be good in a year [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3382.9s)]
*  Maybe we'll take the hit [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3389.46s)]
*  For one year and then maybe it'll be okay after that. Well, Dylan harbors that good then I [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3391.46s)]
*  Don't know you tell me how much crunching can be done. Yeah, I've done a done a bit of crunching here in the spare time [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3398.06s)]
*  I think the biggest thing with him is that he [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3404.22s)]
*  He does everything that you want out of NBA guys like the way at his size [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3408.58s)]
*  That high ball screen. Yeah coming off of that and just the the palette of shit that he can do to you [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3414.98s)]
*  It's really good. And I don't even think his shooting is as bad as the numbers are because I think he's one of those guys [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3421.8599999999997s)]
*  It's like hey [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3426.98s)]
*  I'm this huge deal coming in and some of these kids that just love pulling up and taking bad threes [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3427.62s)]
*  It's like watching Steph's influence at pickup games [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3433.04s)]
*  You'll see some of these higher profile five-star guys that have all the game and you know [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3436.24s)]
*  Want to get their numbers and stuff and his shot selection his decisions on where he'll decide to pull up from [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3441.2799999999997s)]
*  It's bad. His shooting isn't bad [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3448.44s)]
*  his [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3451.64s)]
*  When he pulls it because he's like, ah fuck it [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3452.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll pull it from here [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3454.92s)]
*  But like the way the way he gets going in just the way the NBA plays [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3455.6s)]
*  It's it runs its offense like you could just see it like okay [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3460.3599999999997s)]
*  This is why everybody likes this guy this much because he's he's six four and a half. He's got this handle again [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3463.16s)]
*  I think he's a better shooter than the numbers [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3468.96s)]
*  I'm gonna do I wouldn't be surprised if I [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3472.7999999999997s)]
*  Wouldn't be surprised if Katie to the Spurs is done already and they just haven't announced it [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3477.3999999999996s)]
*  Like it's basically they've they've agreed on specifics [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3483.6s)]
*  And they'll just announce it the week of the draft. I'm not don't aggregate that [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3488.16s)]
*  I've no inside info. It just feels this is goes back to the honest thing [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3492.08s)]
*  I think they're just gonna trade for KD and it'll cost a lot less [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3496.12s)]
*  They'll be able to be really competitive and maybe even go a couple rounds in the playoffs [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3499.7599999999998s)]
*  But they're also gonna keep the number two pick and do it that way [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3504.08s)]
*  Would be my prediction do you like Katie and San Antonio more than you do, Minnesota? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3506.96s)]
*  So what's Minnesota giving up in this scenario? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3513.2400000000002s)]
*  Because they're not allowed with the second apron plus they're not allowed to do sign-in trades, right? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3519.6800000000003s)]
*  They can't like sign Nas read and then trade him for KD. I thought that were restrictions against this stuff [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3524.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3529.6400000000003s)]
*  I thought they were restrictions against this stuff. I'm still trying to figure out [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3532.7599999999998s)]
*  It's it's so punitive to be above [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3538.44s)]
*  So I know they can trade two guys and get one back [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3541.96s)]
*  If they can patch stuff together, so Randall would have to be in it [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3545.64s)]
*  So the Suns would have to be excited about Julius Randall, which I'm suspicious of even though he had a mostly good playoffs [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3548.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3554.46s)]
*  And he also has the player option too [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3554.98s)]
*  So you'd have to figure out what you're you that there opt him in but if I'm him [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3556.4s)]
*  I'm opting out and trying to be a free agent. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3560.84s)]
*  Are you? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3563.54s)]
*  Well, there's no free agents. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3564.6200000000003s)]
*  But there's who's giving him 31 million. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3566.92s)]
*  But you're doing sign and trade stuff, I think, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3570.08s)]
*  at this point. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3572.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just talking if he's just totally, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3573.92s)]
*  I mean, all this stuff would be figured out ahead of time. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3577.92s)]
*  I like your spurs. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3581.44s)]
*  I like your spurs kind of like, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3583.0s)]
*  hey, this is way cheaper, we keep the number two. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3584.32s)]
*  You're probably gonna fall in love with the guy. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3586.9s)]
*  You give up Vasell, right? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3587.7400000000002s)]
*  Vasell has to be in the trade. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3588.56s)]
*  I think it's Vasell and Barnes with a future first, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3590.48s)]
*  and you call it a day. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3594.4s)]
*  Durant's got a year left in his contract, he's 37. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3595.52s)]
*  You're not getting a shitload from him at this point. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3598.28s)]
*  It's something like that. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3601.8s)]
*  You bring in Sohan and be like, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3602.64s)]
*  annoy Beal so he retires. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3603.46s)]
*  It's a big Sohan. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3605.32s)]
*  You signed Thanasis as a free agent, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3609.94s)]
*  and you just have Thanasis just bulldozing [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3611.96s)]
*  into Beal during the practices. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3614.44s)]
*  But you just, your whole job this year, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3617.78s)]
*  you're not gonna get a lot of minutes, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3619.68s)]
*  but we want Lou Dort. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3620.72s)]
*  You're gonna be Lou Dort against Beal [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3623.14s)]
*  every practice all season long, even in the layup line. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3625.04s)]
*  40 years ago, I remember reading [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3629.56s)]
*  the Sports Illustrated story. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3631.0s)]
*  I think it was Chicago. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3632.2799999999997s)]
*  They didn't like Reggie Theis. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3634.24s)]
*  He was the star of the team, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3636.3599999999997s)]
*  and they just basically benched him and stopped playing him [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3637.48s)]
*  as a way to humiliate him. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3640.3799999999997s)]
*  And there was an article about it. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3642.0s)]
*  I barely remember the details. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3643.16s)]
*  Then they ended up trading him, I think, to Sacramento. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3644.44s)]
*  But it got so contentious, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3646.7599999999998s)]
*  they just basically took his playing time away [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3648.08s)]
*  as a way to be vindictive. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3650.96s)]
*  And I wonder, is that the only move left for Phoenix? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3653.52s)]
*  Beal just doesn't play. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3656.48s)]
*  He just sits on the bench. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3658.72s)]
*  Phase one was this year. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3660.36s)]
*  Ways to wait for two years. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3661.2s)]
*  But I'm saying you just don't play him. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3662.52s)]
*  Feel like we expect you to show up on time, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3664.48s)]
*  suit up, and you just never play. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3668.08s)]
*  And maybe you bring him in when it's a 40-point game. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3670.08s)]
*  You bring him in for the last two minutes. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3672.92s)]
*  He has to stretch and come out. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3675.08s)]
*  It's all about basically getting to break him [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3676.76s)]
*  so he waves the no trade clause. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3679.32s)]
*  It sounds like the makings of an FX series. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3681.6400000000003s)]
*  Breaking Beal. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3684.84s)]
*  From the mind that brought you. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3688.82s)]
*  Parker Lewis can't lose. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3690.7200000000003s)]
*  John Landgraf's really high on it. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3691.92s)]
*  He loves this idea. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3693.48s)]
*  There'll be something there. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3697.0400000000004s)]
*  Obviously, it'd be like- [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3698.0400000000004s)]
*  Jordan Peele's an EP, and Jordan Poole. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3699.6000000000004s)]
*  Jordan Poole and Jordan Peele are EPs. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3702.0200000000004s)]
*  Sounds like somebody's working on an outline. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3704.2s)]
*  You know how any place, anyone listening to this, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3708.0s)]
*  you know who this person is because you've experienced it. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3711.3199999999997s)]
*  But in the times where you have an issue [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3714.2s)]
*  with something at work and you're like, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3716.64s)]
*  okay, but why am I having to do this, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3718.24s)]
*  but this guy gets to do this? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3721.56s)]
*  And then the person will just straight up look at you [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3723.68s)]
*  and go, because that guy's a huge pain in the ass. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3725.56s)]
*  And if we don't do this, he's gonna be like, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3728.16s)]
*  and so you're just sitting there going, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3731.48s)]
*  so you're telling me the lesson in this [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3733.16s)]
*  is that I need to be way more of a pain in the ass. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3735.3599999999997s)]
*  I have to be so like, you have to dread me being upset [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3738.2799999999997s)]
*  about something so much that I then end up getting my way. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3742.0s)]
*  And that's not really the way it works. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3745.74s)]
*  With Beale, man, I don't know if there's anybody [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3748.12s)]
*  that's more comfortable being like, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3750.44s)]
*  you think you're gonna get to me? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3751.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3753.48s)]
*  Do whatever you want. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3755.24s)]

*  It's just not breaking. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3770.04s)]

*  Yanis stays on the Bucks was one of mine, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3828.92s)]

*  You don't think, I felt like you were hot on the Knicks thing. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3836.0s)]
*  The Bucks would, I think, here's how it happens. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3841.7200000000003s)]
*  Yanis goes to them and says, I've thought about it. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3845.44s)]
*  I want to be traded to the Knicks. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3848.4399999999996s)]
*  You owe this to me. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3850.8799999999997s)]
*  I won you the title in 2021. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3851.72s)]
*  I've been a great Buc. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3856.12s)]
*  I've been a great credit to the city. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3857.04s)]
*  I've done everything I can do here. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3859.6s)]
*  I would like to go to New York. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3861.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's how it happens. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3863.9199999999996s)]
*  And then it's like towns, bridges, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3865.3199999999997s)]
*  three team trades and picks. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3867.64s)]
*  And the Bucks can basically salvage, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3870.24s)]
*  I don't know, 80 cents of the dollar. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3872.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that's the course. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3874.48s)]
*  But I think Yanis would have to do that. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3875.8799999999997s)]
*  And I just don't think he's gonna do it. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3877.16s)]
*  I don't think he's wired to do that. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3878.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't see him. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3880.44s)]
*  I just don't see it. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3883.72s)]
*  We followed that guy since 2013. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3885.72s)]
*  I feel like I have a pretty good hand on him. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3888.68s)]
*  I just don't see it. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3892.56s)]
*  I think he's more of a batting his eyelashes. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3893.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe, but I don't see him demanding a trade. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3896.3599999999997s)]
*  And I don't think they're gonna trade him unless, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3898.6s)]
*  A, somebody makes some crazy fucking offer, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3900.52s)]
*  or B, he goes in and says, it's time. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3902.7999999999997s)]
*  You gotta trade him into Golden State. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3905.92s)]
*  You gotta trade him into the Knicks. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3907.08s)]
*  But they're gonna trade him the team he wants to get, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3908.6400000000003s)]
*  he wants to get traded to, I think would be my one bet. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3910.32s)]
*  So I think they would do right by him. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3913.52s)]
*  And he'll be smart enough to be like, yeah, I'm not, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3915.04s)]
*  you don't have to give me away, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3919.28s)]
*  but send me to the right team. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3920.2000000000003s)]
*  Here's one I have for you. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3921.48s)]
*  And it's heated up in the last week. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3924.8s)]
*  So I'm probably like two weeks late on this [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3926.4s)]
*  because I felt this way for a while. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3928.1600000000003s)]
*  That I feel like Garland's gonna be in play. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3931.28s)]
*  And I think a lot of people in the league feel this way. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3934.16s)]
*  And now in the last week, there's been some media people [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3935.88s)]
*  and there's been some buzz about it. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3938.88s)]
*  There's a couple pieces to this, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3941.3599999999997s)]
*  which is Cleveland, the second apron, the tax, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3943.2799999999997s)]
*  like they have some real money stuff. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3946.64s)]
*  So if they trade Garland, they have to go down a little bit. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3948.2s)]
*  I was looking at Brooklyn for him. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3952.52s)]
*  And that's gonna be my, I wouldn't be surprised [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3955.3199999999997s)]
*  if dot dot dot team with Brooklyn. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3957.56s)]
*  If it was Garland and Acoro, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3960.52s)]
*  and Cam Johnson coming back to the Cavs [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3963.6s)]
*  with the number seven pick and some other asset [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3966.68s)]
*  because I think he's worth more than that. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3970.68s)]
*  But there's something there. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3973.72s)]
*  And then if you're Brooklyn, you're like, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3974.72s)]
*  we finally have our guy. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3975.92s)]
*  This is one of the best 25 guys in the league. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3977.56s)]
*  He's young, he's gonna be his own team. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3979.96s)]
*  He can be our Halliburton. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3982.36s)]
*  We're gonna build an entire roster around everything [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3984.68s)]
*  that he's good at. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3986.92s)]
*  And we're gonna try to basically do the Halliburton [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3988.2799999999997s)]
*  in Indiana and this is our guy. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3990.0s)]
*  And then if you're Cleveland, it's like, all right, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3992.7999999999997s)]
*  we looked at that Mitchell Garland thing for a while. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3994.72s)]
*  We can't pay Mitchell, Garland, and Mobley. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=3997.72s)]
*  We gotta pay two of the three. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4002.52s)]
*  We get to retail, we get another shooter, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4003.8399999999997s)]
*  we get a draft pick. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4005.72s)]
*  And I don't know, there's something about that trade [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4006.64s)]
*  that makes sense to me. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4008.16s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4009.48s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense and at least Brooklyn feeling [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4012.72s)]
*  like it has something. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4015.7999999999997s)]
*  Although, it felt like they had something with Wakeham. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4017.2s)]
*  Thomas came out the beginning of this year. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4020.8s)]
*  I mean, he was lightening it up, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4022.6800000000003s)]
*  even though he hasn't always been my favorite in the past. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4025.7200000000003s)]
*  I just thought this version of him was better. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4027.92s)]
*  I don't know, does Cam long-term make you think [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4032.36s)]
*  they wouldn't be like, hey, let's add a smaller [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4036.28s)]
*  non-defensive guard next to him? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4039.48s)]
*  Well, you get the seventh pick too, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4043.5600000000004s)]
*  which I think could be a really good player in this draft. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4044.96s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the Nets. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4048.6800000000003s)]
*  Like your backcourt's Garland and Cam Thomas. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4051.16s)]
*  Is Cam Thomas on the perfect team as six man [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4054.2s)]
*  or am I crazy? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4056.56s)]
*  I don't think he would agree with you. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4059.36s)]
*  It's the Colin Sexton problem, right? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4062.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, right. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4065.0s)]
*  It's like if you're a six man, we're doing great. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4065.84s)]
*  Yeah, Sexton can get you buckets. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4067.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4069.56s)]
*  But you just go on and take it. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4070.4s)]
*  Come on in, 23 minutes a game. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4071.2400000000002s)]
*  Score some points for us. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4072.48s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4075.96s)]
*  I know what you're saying here. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4077.52s)]
*  It's like, okay, well, Garland isn't perfect. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4078.56s)]
*  Well then who, I mean, he's young, he can shoot, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4080.72s)]
*  he can handle, we're talking about somebody [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4083.28s)]
*  who's gonna be flirting with a lot of all-star appearances [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4084.8s)]
*  throughout his career, although that's even probably [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4087.32s)]
*  wouldn't be very good, so maybe doesn't make the team [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4089.08s)]
*  because the team isn't good. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4091.44s)]
*  But there's not a lot of homes for him [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4092.72s)]
*  because so many teams are already all in [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4095.48s)]
*  with whoever their point guard is. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4097.52s)]
*  I was going through all the teams [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4099.24s)]
*  because I was like, man, if Garland's available, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4100.6s)]
*  there'd be a fucking line. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4103.12s)]
*  And then you go through all the teams [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4104.24s)]
*  and teams that could actually trade [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4105.68s)]
*  and the list starts to shorten a little faster [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4108.0s)]
*  than you thought. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4111.04s)]
*  Houston would be another one, right? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4111.88s)]
*  Houston could, but then that doesn't really help Cleveland [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4114.679999999999s)]
*  from a salary cap standpoint [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4118.0s)]
*  because part of the deal would have to be, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4121.639999999999s)]
*  they'd have to cut salary in the trade, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4123.679999999999s)]
*  which is why Brooklyn's one of the only teams [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4125.5199999999995s)]
*  that can do that. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4127.04s)]
*  So I don't hate where you're coming up with at all. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4128.76s)]
*  So I'm not doing this where you bring up something [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4131.5599999999995s)]
*  and then I go, oh, there's all the reasons why it doesn't [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4134.2s)]
*  work because it's way easier to do it that way. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4136.32s)]
*  But it's kind of like a face of the franchise thing, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4138.2s)]
*  a team that thought that they had it figured out [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4141.639999999999s)]
*  to now having a roster that I'll have nights with them [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4143.759999999999s)]
*  where I'm like, who the fuck is that? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4146.88s)]
*  And at least you would have a guy you think you can kind of. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4149.32s)]
*  You can mold a team around him, I feel like. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4154.4s)]
*  I don't know how good that team would be, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4157.08s)]
*  but I think conceivably you could do it. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4158.36s)]
*  Do you have another one? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4159.92s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't see how the Sixers [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4162.36s)]
*  take, use that draft pick. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4165.52s)]
*  I think it's a pretty obvious one. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4169.200000000001s)]
*  It's not based on anything. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4171.360000000001s)]
*  It's just, other than just common sense. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4172.64s)]
*  Maybe that front office goes, hey, look, with this team, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4177.0s)]
*  we're never gonna draft this high. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4180.040000000001s)]
*  And then if you fall in love with somebody, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4181.320000000001s)]
*  but I think from a development standpoint, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4183.72s)]
*  unless you're just so good at doing the development stuff [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4186.72s)]
*  when you're not playing in the games, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4189.76s)]
*  although with the way the injury history of that team, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4191.68s)]
*  maybe there's more minutes available [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4193.8s)]
*  than I'm admitting to here. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4195.88s)]
*  But like an ace Bailey, just never playing. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4198.72s)]
*  Does that make a ton of sense? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4204.400000000001s)]
*  Do you think there's any chance he goes third? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4207.240000000001s)]
*  I, no, not necessarily. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4211.68s)]
*  I don't think he goes third. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4215.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really understand. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4217.360000000001s)]
*  Are you saying? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4218.4800000000005s)]
*  I think if Philly keeps that pick, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4220.320000000001s)]
*  I just think they would take Edgecombe. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4222.68s)]
*  Cause he fits the model of the kind of guy [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4225.400000000001s)]
*  that Darrell has been picking for 20 years. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4227.52s)]
*  I just think he would take him. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4229.360000000001s)]
*  Maybe Trey Johnson would be the other one. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4232.76s)]
*  I gotta say, just as you know, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4234.6s)]
*  I dive in slowly and I do the YouTube thing [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4236.400000000001s)]
*  and then I have all process. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4239.4400000000005s)]
*  And by the time we get to the draft, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4240.6s)]
*  I've done my whole YouTube deep dives and everybody. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4242.72s)]
*  Trey Johnson gives great YouTube. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4245.280000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4248.04s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4249.200000000001s)]
*  First initial foray into the Trey Johnson [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4250.72s)]
*  YouTube universe, I was like, whoa. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4253.280000000001s)]
*  Have you done fears yet? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4256.200000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4257.88s)]
*  Good, good YouTube? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4259.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4260.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4262.52s)]
*  It's like when he's at his best [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4263.68s)]
*  and the fact that he like flag reclassified. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4265.84s)]
*  So he's like year younger than he should be [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4269.96s)]
*  with this stuff. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4272.56s)]
*  When he's at his best with his ability to drive [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4274.72s)]
*  and just, you can't stay in front of him. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4277.16s)]
*  Like, I just don't think there's actually [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4278.6s)]
*  as many people that we say like, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4280.0s)]
*  hey, you can't stay in front of this guy. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4281.12s)]
*  Can't stay in front of this guy. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4282.32s)]
*  But then there's also people like, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4283.68s)]
*  if there's no help defense, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4284.68s)]
*  it's not necessarily that hard to get around defenders. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4285.64s)]
*  And then there's fears on this level of [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4288.24s)]
*  like when he gets the angle on you, it's over. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4291.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a good quality to center in on [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4296.0s)]
*  in the NBA and with football receivers. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4298.04s)]
*  Like football receivers are just always wide open [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4301.6s)]
*  because they just get wide open all the time. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4304.24s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they're gonna work in the NFL. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4306.6s)]
*  For some reason, the Patriots decided not to take any [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4309.72s)]
*  of them for 15 years. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4311.84s)]
*  Do you wanna hear something funny about Ace Bailey? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4314.28s)]
*  This has nothing to do with him necessarily, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4318.28s)]
*  but what we were talking about before, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4319.639999999999s)]
*  Michael Porter Jr., Andrew Wiggins on ESPN [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4321.5599999999995s)]
*  for their draft coverage. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4324.84s)]
*  Let me double check, cause it's Jeremy Wu. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4326.639999999999s)]
*  They did a high end and a low end for Ace Bailey. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4330.0s)]
*  And the high end is Michael Porter Jr. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4334.5599999999995s)]
*  The low end is Andrew Wiggins. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4337.28s)]
*  Who had a better career than Michael Porter Jr. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4342.0s)]
*  Andrew Wiggins is gonna have 20,000 points. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4346.12s)]
*  And he was the second best player to finals team. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4349.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I was surprised like Andrew Wiggins is the low end [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4354.12s)]
*  to Michael Porter Jr.'s high end. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4361.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would have flipped that. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4362.36s)]
*  Or is it because Michael Porter Jr., [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4363.96s)]
*  although there's an argument to be made [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4367.4400000000005s)]
*  that both guys are so dynamic athletically, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4368.28s)]
*  and yet you were like, what? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4370.72s)]
*  Should they have said Michael Porter Jr. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4371.56s)]
*  on the right night? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4373.52s)]
*  What if the ceiling? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4375.36s)]
*  Did you need more Michael Porter Jr. information? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4376.2s)]
*  What if the ceiling was Aaron Wiggins? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4378.28s)]
*  Aaron Wiggins on the right night? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4382.16s)]
*  Or Michael Porter Jr.? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4383.8s)]
*  Low end, yeah, Michael Porter Jr. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4384.64s)]
*  Do you have any more I wouldn't be surprised [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4387.04s)]
*  or should we take a break? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4388.52s)]
*  No, we can take a break. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4390.08s)]
*  All right, we'll take a break for the pod. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4391.12s)]
*  Keep going on YouTube. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4392.36s)]
*  All right, quick NBA draft then. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4395.32s)]
*  Because we're getting close now. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4397.76s)]
*  We're not far away. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4398.6s)]
*  I'm gonna give you the top eight. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4399.72s)]
*  Dallas, San Antonio, Philly, Charlotte, Utah, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4401.400000000001s)]
*  Washington, New Orleans, Brooklyn. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4403.92s)]
*  So if I told you one of those teams is trading their pick, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4407.52s)]
*  you would say Philly? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4410.84s)]
*  If you had to bet your money, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4412.92s)]
*  one of those eight teams will trade their pick. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4415.28s)]
*  Dallas, San Antonio, Philly, Charlotte, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4419.72s)]
*  Utah, Washington, New Orleans, Brooklyn. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4421.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if I had to bet, I would bet on Philly. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4424.68s)]
*  I don't know what Utah's gonna do [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4429.0s)]
*  because they probably don't want another guard, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4430.56s)]
*  but what are they supposed to do? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4434.2s)]
*  Like pass on the better guard for a better positional fit [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4436.280000000001s)]
*  for a team that isn't any good right now anyway? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4439.4800000000005s)]
*  I mentioned this to Zach the other night, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4442.16s)]
*  but it was late and he was groggy. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4443.72s)]
*  I'm on high alert with Utah. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4446.280000000001s)]
*  Austin took that job. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4449.92s)]
*  He had a quote in the press conference that I thought, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4451.04s)]
*  kind of gave me one of those where he was just like, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4454.72s)]
*  yeah, we're not tanking anymore. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4457.8s)]
*  He just said it matter of factly. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4459.08s)]
*  I was like, all right. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4461.88s)]
*  And around the league, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4463.52s)]
*  people seem to feel like marketing isn't not available. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4464.4800000000005s)]
*  I would not be surprised if they got aggressive and said, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4472.16s)]
*  okay, let's start coming up with something here. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4475.0s)]
*  Like let's figure out how to piece two for one. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4477.16s)]
*  And if the one isn't a star, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4480.8s)]
*  at least it's somebody who raises, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4482.44s)]
*  who are the five guys that are getting the minutes [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4484.44s)]
*  closing basketball game? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4487.08s)]
*  We have all these little pieces, cool. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4488.44s)]
*  But they're kind of like in that spike. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4491.36s)]
*  Remember Orlando felt like they were always [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4493.28s)]
*  just the one pick behind in the lottery [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4495.16s)]
*  from getting the guy that happened a bunch of years there. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4497.879999999999s)]
*  It was God's way of getting back at them [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4500.96s)]
*  after the early nineties. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4502.96s)]
*  Yeah, it just felt like Utah for a few years now. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4504.879999999999s)]
*  It's just like, oh, cool. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4509.8s)]
*  We're picking here. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4511.280000000001s)]
*  I like that fifth pick for them now. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4512.4800000000005s)]
*  They're gonna get somebody good with that pick. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4513.88s)]
*  It's like this NBA draft every year. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4517.16s)]
*  They might end up with the best guy in the entire draft [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4519.280000000001s)]
*  other than flag with the fifth pick. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4521.4400000000005s)]
*  You just never know. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4523.08s)]
*  I'm gonna give you a list. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4525.24s)]
*  I made this in descending order. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4526.68s)]
*  So highest quality guide down of possibly available guys. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4529.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm gonna read you the list that I've not sent to you. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4534.0s)]
*  It's just hit the buzzer if it's somebody [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4537.12s)]
*  that you did not think is even possibly available. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4540.4400000000005s)]
*  All right. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4543.04s)]
*  Janice. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4544.92s)]
*  Jalen Brown, Garland Towns, next level. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4548.6s)]
*  Jalen Brown, did it make you blink? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4555.280000000001s)]
*  Saying not available? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4558.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm saying possibly available. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4561.4400000000005s)]
*  I think I would qualify Jalen Brown as much as I hate it [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4563.96s)]
*  and I hope they don't trade him. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4566.879999999999s)]
*  I don't think he's untouchable with the situation [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4569.16s)]
*  that team's in right now, do you? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4572.16s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4573.719999999999s)]
*  So was I supposed to hit the buzzer then? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4574.5599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4576.32s)]
*  Okay, that's why I was laying out. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4577.16s)]
*  I don't have a buzzer just for the... [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4578.879999999999s)]
*  Durant, Markanen, that's the next level. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4580.719999999999s)]
*  Both of those guys we think are available. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4583.24s)]
*  Okay, next group. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4584.839999999999s)]
*  Austin Reeves, Trey Murphy, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4588.04s)]
*  I don't know why Trey Murphy would be available. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4594.44s)]
*  Because if you're New Orleans, you're in no man's land, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4598.839999999999s)]
*  you have, are you keeping Zion? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4602.36s)]
*  I guess you are. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4604.36s)]
*  You have the seventh pick, it's not in the top five. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4605.32s)]
*  Could you use Trey Murphy in the seventh pick [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4608.96s)]
*  to get somebody awesome? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4612.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4614.5199999999995s)]
*  Could you try to do your version [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4616.5599999999995s)]
*  of the Mikhail Bridges trade with Trey Murphy? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4617.839999999999s)]
*  And just get a shitload of stuff? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4621.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4622.68s)]
*  I just, I have them written down and it... [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4623.52s)]
*  So you're hitting the buzzer on him. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4625.64s)]
*  I thought he took that step that you're always like hoping [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4629.320000000001s)]
*  for with a bunch of these guys. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4633.080000000001s)]
*  You'd be like, man, he has all the game. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4634.360000000001s)]
*  He has more handle than he's allowed to show. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4636.160000000001s)]
*  They had to run so much more of the offense through him. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4638.400000000001s)]
*  He showed us that he has these skills [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4640.92s)]
*  and I'd wanna see where this goes with him. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4643.64s)]
*  I thought he was really like taking a big step this year. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4647.92s)]
*  So I wouldn't be in a hurry to be moving on from him. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4651.72s)]
*  I'm gonna take you a step further. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4654.24s)]
*  That's the guy I think the Spurs should get. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4656.12s)]
*  Over Durant or Yannis? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4658.96s)]
*  If I was Spurs conciliary over Durant. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4659.8s)]
*  Be like, are we getting Durant? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4662.44s)]
*  He's 37. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4663.92s)]
*  Let's give up some of the same stuff [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4665.76s)]
*  we're gonna give up for Durant. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4667.36s)]
*  Throw some more picks in it [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4668.599999999999s)]
*  and actually try to get Murphy who's hitting his mid-20s [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4669.88s)]
*  and try to get somebody who's actually more on our timeline [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4674.28s)]
*  who's gonna give us a lot of the stuff [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4676.96s)]
*  we would've wanted anyway. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4678.32s)]
*  And I also think last year, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4679.84s)]
*  I think his value is lower than it should be [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4681.24s)]
*  because he didn't work out all last year [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4683.16s)]
*  because he didn't know if he was getting [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4685.400000000001s)]
*  the extension or not. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4686.320000000001s)]
*  Then he immediately gets started the season. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4687.52s)]
*  Didn't start to look like himself [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4689.64s)]
*  until the last part of the year. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4691.2s)]
*  So you're kind of buying low weirdly [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4693.360000000001s)]
*  even though you and I both know he's good. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4695.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4697.4400000000005s)]
*  To me, that would be the Bridges guy this year. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4698.360000000001s)]
*  Be like, whoa, they gave up X first round picks for Murphy? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4700.6s)]
*  It was like, yeah, that's what they did. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4704.4800000000005s)]
*  Anyway, Jared Allen, Herb Jones I have on that list. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4706.12s)]
*  LaMelo? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4713.08s)]
*  Is he possibly available? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4719.92s)]
*  He has to be possibly available, doesn't he? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4722.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4728.64s)]
*  It's same thing with Atlanta with Trey Young [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4730.78s)]
*  where they're always like, he's not available. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4732.4s)]
*  Yeah, but wasn't he available? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4735.24s)]
*  Was he? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4737.04s)]
*  Was he ever available? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4737.88s)]
*  Did anybody ever come close to getting Trey Young? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4738.88s)]
*  No, but wasn't that like the Dejante thing? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4741.76s)]
*  It's like, hey, let's see what the market is [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4743.68s)]
*  for either one of these guys. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4745.24s)]
*  And I'm doing the Dejante deal to try to salvage that deal [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4746.72s)]
*  that did not work out. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4751.0s)]
*  Zion? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4753.6s)]
*  He should be available. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4756.96s)]
*  I don't know what to make of the latest round stuff [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4759.32s)]
*  that his name is caught up with here. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4761.5199999999995s)]
*  Me neither. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4763.28s)]
*  So I just never know what to do with it [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4765.12s)]
*  other than not have a definitive answer. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4766.5199999999995s)]
*  Speculating is something I don't know anything about [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4769.16s)]
*  other than what I've read, whatever else is read. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4770.6s)]
*  However, having said that, I think they're scared to death [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4772.2s)]
*  that he's gonna be like healthy in a star somewhere else. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4775.44s)]
*  And I think the Anthony Davis thing with the Lakers, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4778.76s)]
*  I think Chris Paul leaving there, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4781.8s)]
*  I think there's even like a Baron Davis thing. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4784.16s)]
*  It's like, as soon as we move on from the guy, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4787.16s)]
*  I don't think it's a smart way to do business [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4790.76s)]
*  because I just would not wanna do another season [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4792.68s)]
*  where I have to figure out like, hey, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4794.44s)]
*  Zion's healthy all year, he's really good. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4796.36s)]
*  It makes it the second round of the playoffs [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4798.0s)]
*  and has like comeback player of the year and all this shit. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4799.32s)]
*  Good for him. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4801.2s)]
*  We've done it multiple years here. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4802.16s)]
*  We are held hostage by this guy [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4804.0s)]
*  because everything's in a holding pattern. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4807.44s)]
*  And it's not like it feels like, you know, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4809.719999999999s)]
*  every year everybody comes out and they say the right stuff. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4813.16s)]
*  He's like, oh, he's doing this. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4815.839999999999s)]
*  And it's way more about core now, which he understands. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4817.08s)]
*  And it's like, oh, she has a chef. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4819.879999999999s)]
*  And you're like, shut the fuck up. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4822.92s)]
*  It's similar to C-Web in Washington in the nineties [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4825.36s)]
*  where you kept talking yourself into them year after year. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4830.400000000001s)]
*  And then finally they were like, fuck it. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4833.68s)]
*  West unsold just came in and it's like, fuck it. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4835.16s)]
*  We're trading them for Mitch Richmond. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4836.88s)]
*  I can't take it anymore. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4838.04s)]
*  But if, and if he ends up turning into the guy [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4839.8s)]
*  we think he is, it's just not gonna be here. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4842.56s)]
*  And then of course he goes to Sacramento [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4844.24s)]
*  and immediately becomes awesome. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4845.8s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4850.2s)]
*  I mean, the Weber career is still [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4851.16s)]
*  one of the strangest things ever. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4853.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, to be taken, taken number one overall. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4855.44s)]
*  He could have been, he could have just played next to Shaq [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4859.4s)]
*  in Orlando for 10 years and it would have been fascinating [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4862.0s)]
*  and it never happens. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4865.04s)]
*  And then he ends up on that awesome Golden State team [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4866.5599999999995s)]
*  and he's only there for a year and bulldozes his way out [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4869.68s)]
*  cause it's like Don Nelson. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4871.76s)]
*  Then ends up on this crap Washington team for years. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4872.96s)]
*  And I don't think he acquitted himself that great [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4878.28s)]
*  in a bunch of different ways either. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4881.52s)]
*  But then he goes to Sacramento [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4882.360000000001s)]
*  and finally finds the right team. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4883.6s)]
*  Took nine years from the eight years [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4885.76s)]
*  from the final right team. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4888.6s)]
*  I can't remember how many years. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4889.52s)]
*  All right, all the other guys. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4893.360000000001s)]
*  It's funny though, when you lay out [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4894.4800000000005s)]
*  all the possibly available guys [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4895.72s)]
*  and you get to like, you know, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4899.2s)]
*  Cam Johnson, Norm Powell, Pertle, Drew Holiday, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4902.6s)]
*  Porzingis, Daniel Gafford, Vucevich, DeRozan, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4906.12s)]
*  DeAndre Hunter, RJ Barrett. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4911.44s)]
*  Like there's a lot of guys at like reasonable contracts. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4913.16s)]
*  So maybe that's the case for it being [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4917.28s)]
*  like the craziest summer ever. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4919.04s)]
*  There's a lot of guys in that like 20 to 25 million range [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4920.28s)]
*  that you could just see, you know, become a musical chairs. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4923.92s)]
*  Because I saw one of the Toronto things [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4928.88s)]
*  and you know, I don't know, it feels a little overstated. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4931.96s)]
*  It's like, oh, Masai really likes Giannis. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4935.36s)]
*  I'm like, oh, he's the GM that likes Giannis? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4937.16s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, no shit. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4938.759999999999s)]
*  He's always liked him. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4940.04s)]
*  Wanted to draft him. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4941.04s)]
*  He's always liked him. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4942.759999999999s)]
*  2013, really wanted him. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4943.92s)]
*  I love it when it's a guy who's had the belt. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4946.28s)]
*  At one point it was understood [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4948.28s)]
*  he's the best player in the world. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4949.599999999999s)]
*  And then you hear this thing, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4950.719999999999s)]
*  he's like, that GM's always liked that guy. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4951.5599999999995s)]
*  He's like, holy shit, no wonder he got that job. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4953.2s)]
*  He's got a real eye for the special ones. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4955.5199999999995s)]
*  And then I saw the proposal and it's like, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4958.679999999999s)]
*  so now the Bucks are just the Toronto Raptors. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4959.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4962.5599999999995s)]
*  What's the fucking point of that? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4964.28s)]
*  There is no point. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4966.639999999999s)]
*  There isn't. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4967.639999999999s)]
*  Although those Raptors, man, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4968.48s)]
*  they tried to tank and they were, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4972.04s)]
*  their spirit was too fierce. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4974.08s)]
*  That team, look at how they close the regular season. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4976.879999999999s)]
*  That team played hard. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4980.799999999999s)]
*  You were really focused on it. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4982.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because I desperately wanted to go under [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4984.5199999999995s)]
*  because Raptors fans were so fucking annoying, shocker, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4987.24s)]
*  when you and I did the preview about them in the summer. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4991.92s)]
*  They did. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4994.76s)]
*  Right, and we were like, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4995.6s)]
*  wait, you guys think they're gonna be good? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4996.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4998.36s)]
*  And then they went over by like a half a game [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=4999.2s)]
*  because at one point it was like a lock under. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5001.6s)]
*  Really trying for two straight butts. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5003.72s)]
*  Right, and then they got over [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5005.76s)]
*  because they kind of, they played much better. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5007.76s)]
*  Like whenever you went into Face Toronto, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5010.32s)]
*  it's like they're actually gonna play better than you are [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5012.2s)]
*  because they're just responding [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5014.88s)]
*  and these young dudes are out there ballin' the whole time. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5016.4s)]
*  So then it was like this big victory lap. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5018.68s)]
*  People that get mad about the over under, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5021.400000000001s)]
*  unless we see like a number 50 and we go, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5023.76s)]
*  hey, I think they have a 35-win team, it's about the number. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5025.92s)]
*  And on top of everything else, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5029.4800000000005s)]
*  everything we said about the Raptors [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5031.320000000001s)]
*  and our lack of thinking that this team [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5032.68s)]
*  was gonna figure this whole thing out this year [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5034.4800000000005s)]
*  and be like a competitive team in the East, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5036.160000000001s)]
*  which is what some of the arguments that we were seeing, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5037.72s)]
*  it's like forget over under 28, 27 and a half, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5040.52s)]
*  whatever it was, you think they're gonna be good? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5044.4800000000005s)]
*  So. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5048.360000000001s)]
*  Wasn't great. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5049.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's expensive, it's an expensive team. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5051.12s)]
*  Yeah, some of the fun stuff for this summer, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5053.8s)]
*  like how does Phoenix get out of this giant 20-foot hole [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5057.639999999999s)]
*  they dug for themselves? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5060.96s)]
*  I don't think they'll be able to, but they're gonna try. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5062.04s)]
*  Can the Lakers either get a center [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5066.84s)]
*  or turn Reeves into a center, right? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5069.4s)]
*  If they feel like. They'll get a center, but. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5072.24s)]
*  Is it gonna be a center that you could play in a game [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5074.599999999999s)]
*  like with the speed and pace that we saw today? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5076.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's gonna be funny, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5081.08s)]
*  because whoever they get, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5083.24s)]
*  everybody's gonna be like awesome. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5085.679999999999s)]
*  Here, in LA. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5088.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like it doesn't matter. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5090.44s)]
*  There's a center right now. 57 win ceiling right now. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5091.36s)]
*  There's a center right now that Lakers fans can't stand [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5094.44s)]
*  or have never seen him play that much. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5097.08s)]
*  And as soon as he's a Laker, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5099.04s)]
*  I'm gonna be like, fucking look out, dude, look out. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5100.88s)]
*  We got Nick Richards? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5104.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5106.08s)]
*  New Orleans, one way or the other, I think is gonna be. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5108.92s)]
*  That's the team where I'm like, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5111.84s)]
*  you could tell me any direction and I'd believe it. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5113.2s)]
*  Well, I don't know if it's different now post-Griff, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5117.08s)]
*  but Griff was about as straightforward as ever [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5118.88s)]
*  at the close of last season. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5124.32s)]
*  So not this one we just finished up. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5125.68s)]
*  But remember. Oh, when he was talking about [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5127.16s)]
*  we gotta blow it up. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5128.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5129.36s)]
*  He basically is sitting there going, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5130.2s)]
*  we can't come back like this. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5131.6s)]
*  And it's like, all right, well, you know, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5133.32s)]
*  I guess you made the Dejante deal, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5136.72s)]
*  but that wasn't really what we were thinking about. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5139.04s)]
*  You know what? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5141.68s)]
*  He shouldn't have said that. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5142.52s)]
*  That'd be like sitting at a poker table and going, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5144.32s)]
*  I have to go in on a hand soon [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5147.32s)]
*  because I've been sitting here too long, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5149.12s)]
*  not going in on any hands. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5151.24s)]
*  The table's like, okay, good to know. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5153.36s)]
*  But that might be ownership though. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5155.32s)]
*  That very well could be the ownership thing [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5156.68s)]
*  that we always need to factor in. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5158.28s)]
*  It's like, okay, cool. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5159.52s)]
*  You're in charge of all this, but you're not. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5160.84s)]
*  So you can say whatever you want [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5163.52s)]
*  and take trade calls and all this stuff. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5165.36s)]
*  But like, if Zion still feels like he's too important [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5167.08s)]
*  to that team and there's this fear [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5171.76s)]
*  of him being somewhere else, I don't know. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5173.76s)]
*  Maybe they run it back again, but geez. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5175.08s)]
*  Is Cleveland gonna toss away last year and say, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5178.4s)]
*  let's run it back or are they actually gonna do something? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5181.88s)]
*  I'm watching that. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5184.08s)]
*  What's San Antonio doing with their number two? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5185.2s)]
*  What's Boston gonna do to shed payroll? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5188.12s)]
*  And then the only other one we didn't talk about, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5190.92s)]
*  and I don't really know the answer, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5192.68s)]
*  is there any way for Denver to get better? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5195.72s)]
*  Is there a move for them? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5199.12s)]
*  And I'm not sure there is. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5202.04s)]
*  Say that again. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5207.12s)]
*  Is there a way for Denver to go up a level? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5210.320000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5212.92s)]
*  Keeping Yocage, Murray, Gordon, and Brown. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5213.740000000001s)]
*  They're kind of handicapped with the picks they can trade. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5219.240000000001s)]
*  They kind of have to hope somebody gets excited [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5222.320000000001s)]
*  about Michael Porter Jr., but now you're taking [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5224.92s)]
*  somebody else's problem back, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5226.36s)]
*  or you're trying to split Porter into two guys. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5229.04s)]
*  Other than that, not a lot of moves that are possible [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5232.759999999999s)]
*  with the way the salary cap works, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5235.759999999999s)]
*  and I don't know how they get better. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5237.28s)]
*  Is this the best you felt about the Nuggets [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5238.639999999999s)]
*  at any point in the season today? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5240.759999999999s)]
*  Right now with the season over? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5242.639999999999s)]
*  It might be. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5244.16s)]
*  It might be. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5246.08s)]
*  I think they have to hope somebody gets excited [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5247.5199999999995s)]
*  about Porter with two years left on his deal. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5249.599999999999s)]
*  That's the only thing I can think of. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5252.2s)]
*  Yeah, because I had made the mistake [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5254.92s)]
*  of talking about Porter Jr. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5256.28s)]
*  and going, why is ownership so enamored with this guy [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5258.96s)]
*  just because of where he played in school? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5261.68s)]
*  And then the reality is he had spent more time [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5264.400000000001s)]
*  with the connection of Missouri. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5268.52s)]
*  So that was a mistake by me, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5270.12s)]
*  but then when I thought about it more, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5271.76s)]
*  it's like, okay, now explain to me why though [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5273.320000000001s)]
*  you would be like, we can't trade that guy. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5275.72s)]
*  We can't. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5277.88s)]
*  We've passed that point. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5278.72s)]
*  Passed that point. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5280.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5281.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5282.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know if he's... [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5283.4s)]
*  It feels like Porter, if you're trading him, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5286.679999999999s)]
*  it's not for this other piece. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5291.48s)]
*  It's like, holy shit. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5293.2s)]
*  I feel totally different now about Denver. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5294.44s)]
*  It's probably some other guy that has baggage. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5296.36s)]
*  I mean, this feels a bit like a Gilbert Arena's [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5298.36s)]
*  Richard Lewis thing. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5300.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5301.32s)]
*  I was just thinking that. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5302.16s)]
*  It's like a Kuzma and Pat Conaton [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5302.98s)]
*  for Michael Porter type of trade. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5304.92s)]
*  Where you're just going, what was that trade? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5307.639999999999s)]
*  Did they get two guys back? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5309.76s)]
*  Although there is the Jokic bump. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5311.68s)]
*  What does Kuzma look like running around next to Jokic? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5314.56s)]
*  Doc's always like Porter. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5320.320000000001s)]
*  Probably still expensive. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5321.52s)]
*  So not great, Bob. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5322.96s)]
*  Well, that's all stuff we have looking at. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5325.84s)]
*  Anything else you want to hit before we go? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5327.88s)]
*  Tires, season two? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5329.84s)]
*  Yeah, let's hit that. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5331.56s)]
*  So I didn't really like Tires season one. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5333.08s)]
*  Oh. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5335.200000000001s)]
*  Wasn't a huge fan. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5336.8s)]
*  I watched a couple episodes [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5338.4800000000005s)]
*  because our guy Shane was in it. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5340.84s)]
*  And it just felt like they didn't know what the show was. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5342.92s)]
*  And they didn't know how to use Shane. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5345.84s)]
*  And I just didn't totally work for me. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5348.6s)]
*  And then a couple of people in my life told me, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5351.6s)]
*  you got to check out Tires season two. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5353.4400000000005s)]
*  They figured it out. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5355.32s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5356.24s)]
*  They figured it out. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5358.04s)]
*  The show is excellent. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5359.92s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5362.72s)]
*  I love season two. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5363.88s)]
*  I did not like season one. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5364.88s)]
*  I love season two. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5365.88s)]
*  And you liked it too. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5366.8s)]
*  I love season two. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5368.6s)]
*  Because it really feels like the show's going for it [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5371.04s)]
*  in a way where I don't know. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5375.8s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's because Gillis is this much more [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5377.92s)]
*  famous a year later. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5380.0s)]
*  Or comfortable. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5381.72s)]
*  It seems like he's better on the show too. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5383.08s)]
*  They know how to use him now. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5385.2s)]
*  Correct. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5387.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think I like, well, his character's Will, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5388.0s)]
*  but it's Steve Gerben. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5392.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5393.84s)]
*  I don't know if they call him. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5394.16s)]
*  I was watching his thing with Seth Meyers. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5396.0s)]
*  So Shane is sitting next to Steve. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5399.2s)]
*  And Steve's doing all of these things, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5403.16s)]
*  but he's not trying to be funny. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5405.72s)]
*  They're just him being nervous. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5407.36s)]
*  And it makes it that much fucking funnier. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5408.92s)]
*  And he's stumbling through something. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5411.56s)]
*  And Seth Meyers is like, what's going on with you? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5413.84s)]
*  And he's like, oh, it's my first time. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5416.08s)]
*  And he's like, first time talking ever? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5417.32s)]
*  And then he sees the thing of water [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5419.84s)]
*  and didn't realize it was there. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5421.32s)]
*  And he got really excited. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5422.28s)]
*  And what's so funny about it? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5423.64s)]
*  I think whenever you're thinking about how [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5425.24s)]
*  a TV show fits together, it's like, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5427.0s)]
*  what's the chemistry going to be with all of these guys? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5428.4s)]
*  And the joy that Gillis seems to get out of watching Steve [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5431.08s)]
*  be in the show, whatever the background is [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5437.96s)]
*  with these two dudes, and I'll see this stuff [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5441.12s)]
*  with Gillis' podcast. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5444.84s)]
*  And they talk about Steve, whether he's there [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5446.28s)]
*  or he's not there. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5448.8s)]
*  And then they play these videos of him. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5449.639999999999s)]
*  It's like they're buddy that they just [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5451.56s)]
*  can't stop fucking laughing at. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5455.320000000001s)]
*  And they've captured that in a really great way on a TV show. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5457.160000000001s)]
*  Because there's so many people who would say that [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5460.360000000001s)]
*  their dynamic would be, oh, we're really funny. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5462.360000000001s)]
*  And it would just be like you and us hanging out. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5464.88s)]
*  They've pulled off the rare success [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5466.8s)]
*  of our workplace as a show. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5468.8s)]
*  Everybody's walking around thinking that, saying that. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5470.92s)]
*  Most everybody's wrong. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5473.280000000001s)]
*  And look, they're great writers. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5475.080000000001s)]
*  They're all pretty funny guys. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5477.64s)]
*  I think Gillis is, I've been in the tank for him now [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5479.76s)]
*  for a bunch of years. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5482.84s)]
*  But they have something here that I think [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5484.320000000001s)]
*  is very hard to execute. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5487.52s)]
*  And watching them do interviews together, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5489.200000000001s)]
*  especially the Seth Meyers stuff, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5491.88s)]
*  watching Gillis fucking dying laughing at his buddy [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5493.320000000001s)]
*  being late night TV. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5497.200000000001s)]
*  And he's not laughing because he's killing these one liners. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5498.88s)]
*  He's laughing because of who this dude is. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5501.6s)]
*  Right, he thoroughly enjoys them. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5504.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right, right. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5506.0s)]
*  So sometimes this will happen where they don't totally [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5507.48s)]
*  figure out the show and how everybody works together [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5510.0s)]
*  for a year. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5512.5199999999995s)]
*  Parks and Rec was one of the most famous examples of that. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5513.32s)]
*  They didn't really get the show going until season two. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5516.08s)]
*  This one just feels like they recalibrated how much [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5519.16s)]
*  Shane should be in it. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5522.5599999999995s)]
*  And they basically increased his usage rate. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5524.719999999999s)]
*  I think they looked at his stats from season one [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5528.0s)]
*  and they're like, wow, he had the fourth highest usage [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5530.48s)]
*  rate on our cast. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5534.759999999999s)]
*  We got to say, every five minutes, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5536.280000000001s)]
*  can just Shane do something? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5538.56s)]
*  And they've unleashed him. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5540.400000000001s)]
*  And some of it just feels like he's doing leftover bits [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5542.12s)]
*  from his stand up, but in a good way, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5545.280000000001s)]
*  where he's just doing these little jags [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5547.68s)]
*  or these little analogies that he used. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5550.8s)]
*  But yeah, I fucking loved it. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5552.76s)]
*  I was laughing my ass off. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5555.04s)]
*  And I never laugh when I watch stuff, very rarely, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5558.16s)]
*  to the point that my daughter was upstairs and kept like, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5561.0s)]
*  what are you laughing at? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5563.4800000000005s)]
*  What's going on down here? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5564.4400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know, this tires. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5565.88s)]
*  It's really good, making me laugh. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5567.4s)]
*  So anyway, kudos to them. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5569.4s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5571.679999999999s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5572.5199999999995s)]
*  And there's just, again, Gillis kind of has that way [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5573.36s)]
*  with me now that Chappelle had. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5575.44s)]
*  And some of the Will Ferrell stuff that was just funny [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5577.5599999999995s)]
*  is like he would find a way or a phrasing. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5580.48s)]
*  And then when they get their bonus checks at the beginning [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5582.96s)]
*  and Gillis is like, I'm gonna buy a gun. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5584.759999999999s)]
*  And it's just hilarious. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5586.88s)]
*  It's so fucking funny. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5589.2s)]
*  And I love that Thomas Hayden Church is his dad [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5591.88s)]
*  and he shows up and that first scene [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5595.96s)]
*  and he's trying to get Gillis to hit on the waitress [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5597.5599999999995s)]
*  and then she walks away and Thomas Hayden Church is like, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5599.68s)]
*  you look ripped. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5602.32s)]
*  Then he's like, she heard that. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5605.16s)]
*  He's like, of course she heard it. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5606.28s)]
*  You said it so loud. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5607.5599999999995s)]
*  He's like, do you think she's gonna forget what I look like [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5608.68s)]
*  just walking away? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5611.72s)]
*  So having Gillis' dad be this guy [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5613.04s)]
*  that's actually pretty successful, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5616.32s)]
*  there's just adding more and more layers to the whole thing. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5619.08s)]
*  Which is what- [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5621.5599999999995s)]
*  Good cameo, Vince Vaughn too is another one [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5622.38s)]
*  where they're just smartly bringing people [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5624.0s)]
*  into the universe quickly and then getting them out. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5626.0s)]
*  Right, Goose making an appearance. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5628.56s)]
*  I think it's really, really fucking funny. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5632.02s)]
*  And his love interest this season, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5634.52s)]
*  that was one that shouldn't have worked [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5637.24s)]
*  and they had great chemistry and it was super funny [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5638.72s)]
*  every time they were in a scene. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5641.08s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5642.84s)]
*  I was also surprised it was 12 episodes. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5643.96s)]
*  Because usually these things are like eight, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5647.24s)]
*  but they're like 12, 25 minute episodes. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5651.02s)]
*  Huge thumbs up from me. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5654.400000000001s)]
*  Also, we know Gillis is an athlete. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5656.280000000001s)]
*  I gotta be honest with you. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5661.740000000001s)]
*  When I saw him work in the post. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5663.52s)]
*  Oh, when they were playing the horse? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5667.08s)]
*  Yeah, but he had a little post move in there. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5669.0s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5671.64s)]
*  That's your 90s four. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5673.56s)]
*  You could just tell immediately. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5677.320000000001s)]
*  And I'm an evaluator of basketball as you are. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5678.92s)]
*  We've been doing this a long time. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5681.4400000000005s)]
*  And the way he sealed and turned to that strong shoulder, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5684.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, fucking A, this guy. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5686.96s)]
*  I wish we'd seen more. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5689.6s)]
*  That's my only critique of season two [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5690.6s)]
*  is I'd like to see more post game. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5692.200000000001s)]
*  Season three maybe, an intramural football game [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5694.04s)]
*  or some softball, some tire softball, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5697.84s)]
*  like a tires rabble, that would be good. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5700.56s)]
*  Yeah, because this character. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5702.360000000001s)]
*  The show's not gonna be out for a while. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5703.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because Shane's character, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5704.4400000000005s)]
*  that guy in real life is playing full on tackle football [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5705.9800000000005s)]
*  with no insurance on the weekends in some men's league. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5709.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it was a pleasant surprise. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5714.56s)]
*  I'm rarely pleasantly surprised anymore [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5716.0s)]
*  because sometimes I'll dive into these. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5718.6s)]
*  Like, and my expectations are fully where they should be. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5720.240000000001s)]
*  But in this case, it was like, oh, they figured it out. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5723.4800000000005s)]
*  This is great. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5726.68s)]
*  I'm so glad I clicked onto this. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5727.52s)]
*  Anything else before we go? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5730.280000000001s)]
*  You got Tuesday, Thursday this week for you? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5732.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we actually do have Bucci. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5734.240000000001s)]
*  So you're home for hockey. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5735.52s)]
*  Bucci's coming. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5738.68s)]
*  Just tell him to do his thing again about McDavid [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5739.4800000000005s)]
*  with the no rings thing. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5742.04s)]
*  Because it was really good. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5743.76s)]
*  I didn't do it justice. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5744.58s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you didn't do a great job with that. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5748.68s)]
*  I did like a B minus job. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5750.8s)]
*  No, I'm excited. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5756.92s)]
*  I really like Bucci, man. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5757.84s)]
*  So it's good to have him come on [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5759.6s)]
*  and I'll lay out quite a bit in that one. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5761.76s)]
*  Because I just, watching Kaepernick [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5764.4800000000005s)]
*  in those first two nights, I was like, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5766.68s)]
*  dude, is Kaepernick good? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5767.76s)]
*  And then I looked up his stats and I was like, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5769.28s)]
*  I know he's had a few stops. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5771.48s)]
*  Something about him I really like. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5772.96s)]
*  Did you see Murab last night? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5774.96s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5777.2s)]
*  Had a big dinner last night. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5779.4s)]
*  That's it for O'Malley. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5780.599999999999s)]
*  Another UFC superstar is coming, God. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5784.32s)]
*  So what, he had lost to the guy who kissed him [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5789.12s)]
*  on the back of the head, right? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5791.84s)]
*  Well, he lost to Murab twice. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5793.24s)]
*  Yeah, oh, that's Murab, yeah. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5794.84s)]
*  My bad. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5796.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not super locked into the UFC right now. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5797.26s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5798.96s)]
*  Maybe I'm less hostile. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5800.1s)]
*  You took the Pereira loss hard. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5801.5s)]
*  I did. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5803.620000000001s)]
*  You don't have a guy. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5804.9800000000005s)]
*  Maybe because I'm in it, you know? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5807.46s)]
*  Like, I'm training twice a week and it's like, I don't. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5809.26s)]
*  What are you doing, Muay Thai? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5813.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5814.620000000001s)]
*  So I can't, I can't like, maybe that's my, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5815.860000000001s)]
*  I remember there was this 311 documentary that I watched [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5819.660000000001s)]
*  and they interviewed this guy [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5823.1s)]
*  who may not have had a mailing address. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5824.34s)]
*  And they were like, what kind of music do you like? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5828.54s)]
*  He's like, and he had a guitar, I think. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5833.54s)]
*  And he was like, I don't like anyone. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5836.38s)]
*  Cause they were like, have you ever heard of 311? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5840.1s)]
*  He's like, no, I don't listen to music. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5841.54s)]
*  And they're like, you don't listen to music, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5842.94s)]
*  but you have a guitar. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5844.0199999999995s)]
*  Guitar. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5845.66s)]
*  Yeah, and he's like, I don't want anyone style [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5846.5s)]
*  to influence me. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5849.9s)]
*  I don't want anyone else. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5850.86s)]
*  I don't want to listen to anyone else [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5852.7s)]
*  cause then it's gonna change what I'm able to do. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5853.74s)]
*  So maybe that's why I'm not watching as much USC. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5856.94s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5858.98s)]
*  Muay Thai, like, how, what's the level? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5860.0599999999995s)]
*  Like where do you need to get to? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5864.0199999999995s)]
*  What are you learning? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5866.46s)]
*  How have you gotten better? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5867.58s)]
*  Dude. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5870.099999999999s)]
*  How many months have you been doing it? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5870.94s)]
*  Maybe two years. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5875.98s)]
*  Two years. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5877.259999999999s)]
*  I did it when I was really young, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5878.219999999999s)]
*  but it wasn't like, you know, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5880.86s)]
*  I'd get wrapped up like a fucking pretzel. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5882.179999999999s)]
*  I was a very big kid. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5884.339999999999s)]
*  Pretty skinny, Bill. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5885.78s)]
*  And then, you know, I started working with a coach. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5887.259999999999s)]
*  So it's usually like a few different coaches come down [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5892.259999999999s)]
*  and then, you know, you learn moves. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5895.099999999999s)]
*  You try to get your cardio going. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5897.099999999999s)]
*  I love learning moves. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5898.82s)]
*  I love new moves. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5899.98s)]
*  And then you spar. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5901.5s)]
*  And, you know, every one of the coaches could kill me [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5902.58s)]
*  in two seconds if he wanted to, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5905.3s)]
*  but it's sometimes harder sparring. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5907.139999999999s)]
*  Sometimes it's a lot of light sparring. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5908.66s)]
*  And then sometimes we'll see, like, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5910.86s)]
*  we had a big thing that we were working towards. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5912.38s)]
*  Like, let's see if I can last 10 rounds. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5914.3s)]
*  You know, I think we went three minute rounds. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5915.900000000001s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5918.54s)]
*  We went three minute rounds, one minute in between, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5919.38s)]
*  and I had no idea. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5921.62s)]
*  I was like, I don't know if I'm gonna make it. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5922.66s)]
*  And I did. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5924.18s)]
*  I probably wouldn't tell the story if I didn't. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5925.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, I probably would tell the story if I didn't. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5926.820000000001s)]
*  Because there was another time where he was like, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5928.42s)]
*  I'm just gonna punch you as many times as I can [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5929.860000000001s)]
*  to see if you quit. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5932.3s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm not gonna quit. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5933.34s)]
*  And then I quit in like two minutes. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5934.900000000001s)]
*  I just couldn't fucking get this guy off of me. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5936.7s)]
*  So it sucked. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5939.26s)]
*  Where did he punch you? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5940.1s)]
*  Everywhere. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5941.780000000001s)]
*  But not like, you know, he's not like taking full shots. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5943.06s)]
*  You're wearing the headgear thing, right? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5946.14s)]
*  I've got a mouthpiece in. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5946.9800000000005s)]
*  I've got headgear. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5947.9400000000005s)]
*  And you know, you've got the shin pads and stuff. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5948.820000000001s)]
*  And, you know, he wasn't like, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5951.660000000001s)]
*  he wasn't trying to kill me. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5956.540000000001s)]
*  He was trying to see if he could get me to like, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5958.540000000001s)]

*  That's what OKC was doing in Indiana today. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5965.1s)]
*  Perfect bookend. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5968.46s)]
*  But yeah, it's really just, it's a great exercise, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5970.5s)]

*  I have a torn at MCL. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5976.22s)]
*  The calf tear wasn't a fun day. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5977.66s)]
*  That hurt a lot. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5979.86s)]
*  And I'm not like getting clocked, clocked. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=5981.58s)]

*  It's pretty good. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6006.14s)]
*  Who's voting on these? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6006.98s)]
*  It's a pretty beloved movie. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6008.66s)]

*  plus YouTube, plus Pluto and 2B, all these things. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6044.06s)]
*  I don't understand how movies can disappear. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6047.78s)]
*  I should be able to queue up Eddie and the Cruisers [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6050.3s)]
*  or Kiss of Death. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6052.38s)]
*  And be able to do rewatchables. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6054.46s)]
*  Kiss of Death only came out 30 years ago. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6056.22s)]
*  It's got major stars in it. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6058.3s)]
*  How is it just gone? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6060.02s)]
*  You can't find Kiss of Death anywhere. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6061.46s)]
*  Gone. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6063.9400000000005s)]
*  How to watch Kiss of Death. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6065.46s)]
*  No, you're not gonna find it. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6066.9400000000005s)]
*  I do this once a week, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6069.06s)]
*  because I'm waiting for it to come back, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6070.22s)]
*  so CR and I can do Kiss of Death, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6071.46s)]
*  and it's just not available. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6074.700000000001s)]
*  There's some YouTube version of it where it's flipped, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6076.18s)]
*  and it's got weird subtitles, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6079.46s)]
*  and it's just the visuals are way off. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6081.26s)]
*  It's not available. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6083.18s)]
*  Nick Cage, one of his great movies, just gone. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6085.06s)]
*  Who knows what happens? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6088.26s)]
*  I had it on, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6089.620000000001s)]
*  because when I worked at the music shop [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6090.820000000001s)]
*  back in high school, [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6092.3s)]
*  upstairs was a video rental place. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6093.820000000001s)]
*  So they used to just be cleaning them out, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6096.1s)]
*  and every now and then they'd be like, do you want me? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6098.14s)]
*  You grabbed Kiss of Death. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6100.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I took a box of 40 movies back up to campus. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6101.820000000001s)]
*  I think it was my sophomore year, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6106.1s)]
*  because I would work over Christmas break or whatever. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6107.22s)]
*  Pick up some hours. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6109.38s)]
*  And I was the go-to guy, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6111.5s)]
*  but people were just shocked. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6113.7s)]
*  They were like, who the fuck would put together [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6114.86s)]
*  this kind of movie collection? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6116.5s)]
*  I was like, no one. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6117.58s)]
*  No one did it. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6118.82s)]
*  These were all free. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6119.66s)]
*  They were free, and dudes watch movies. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6120.5s)]
*  And so I had The Heir Up There, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6123.94s)]
*  which is probably not on their watch list, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6126.42s)]
*  with Kevin Bacon. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6128.139999999999s)]
*  And the number of times I watched that movie, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6129.26s)]
*  because you just throw it in to fall asleep. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6131.3s)]
*  I watched the first half of that movie, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6133.099999999999s)]
*  probably more than any single human on the face of the planet. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6135.179999999999s)]
*  You ever think- You mean like Kevin Bacon? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6138.26s)]
*  Definitely watch it more than him. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6139.94s)]
*  It's a bit like the movie Thai thing. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6141.22s)]
*  Honestly, you have to watch the UFC. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6142.42s)]
*  I mean, he's living it. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6143.66s)]
*  He knows what it was like on those shooting days. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6144.86s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6146.7s)]
*  I like to think about that, just as an aside, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6148.5s)]
*  what have I done more than any person in the world? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6150.82s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6157.74s)]
*  Do you got any- [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6158.58s)]
*  Like for you? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6159.38s)]
*  Well, for me, it could be watching The Heir Up There. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6162.02s)]
*  It's not great. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6166.9800000000005s)]
*  I'll admit it. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6167.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not like you wouldn't introduce me. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6168.82s)]
*  Hey, this is my buddy Ryan. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6170.7s)]
*  He's watched The Heir Up There, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6171.54s)]
*  or at least the first half more than any other person. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6172.38s)]
*  This would be a good podcast, the movie you've watched. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6173.98s)]
*  You feel like you've watched the most, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6176.94s)]
*  more than all other humans. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6179.7s)]
*  I think mine's 48 hours. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6181.86s)]
*  If it's on cable, I just get, I'm like fine. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6185.7s)]
*  We're about to hang out outside the garage overnight [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6190.1s)]
*  and he's gonna take a nap in the back seat. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6192.94s)]
*  I'm in for another half hour here. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6194.94s)]
*  Do you think anyone's written more words [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6196.78s)]
*  about 90210 than you? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6198.3s)]
*  Probably, yeah. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6202.42s)]
*  Probably like, recappers. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6203.26s)]
*  I think I wrote, I think I did [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6206.62s)]
*  probably the most Karate Kid stuff. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6209.06s)]
*  I feel like I had that corner. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6212.7s)]
*  No, who's talked about Heat more than you? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6214.14s)]
*  Well, CR isn't on that too, though. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6217.38s)]
*  Did the studio- [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6219.74s)]
*  The two of us together. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6220.58s)]
*  Sure, okay, but do you think the studio [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6221.42s)]
*  spent more time discussing the movie Heat, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6222.74s)]
*  whether it was to buy the script, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6225.14s)]
*  then during production, casting, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6226.74s)]
*  all the stuff that goes into it? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6228.34s)]
*  Then CR and I have spent talking about it? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6229.86s)]
*  I don't think that's close. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6231.54s)]
*  I think you beat the studio. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6232.74s)]
*  So who else is there? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6234.5s)]
*  There's another movie that we've spent [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6235.9s)]
*  a lot of time talking about [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6237.9s)]
*  that we've done on the rewatchables already, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6239.46s)]
*  but I actually like it more, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6241.86s)]
*  even than when we did it on the rewatchables, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6243.86s)]
*  is the Miami Vice 2006 movie with Colin Farrell. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6245.58s)]
*  That's like its own fan club at this point. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6248.98s)]
*  Because that movie gets better every single year, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6252.74s)]
*  and I have no idea why. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6254.94s)]
*  It's one of the few movies that has [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6256.66s)]
*  improved in quality each year. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6259.66s)]
*  Now, 2025, I think it's the best I've ever felt about it. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6263.42s)]
*  I mean, you can't say that about a lot of movies, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6266.82s)]
*  where each year that passes, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6268.62s)]
*  you feel better about the movie. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6271.3s)]
*  I think that's number one for me. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6272.9s)]
*  I don't know if you watched it recently. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6275.42s)]
*  I haven't, I was trying to figure out- [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6278.94s)]
*  You kind of know-selling me. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6279.9s)]
*  I know, I'm sorry. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6281.62s)]
*  I wanted to look up the Rotten Tomatoes [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6282.74s)]
*  for the air up there, so I wasn't- [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6284.099999999999s)]
*  What was it? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6286.18s)]
*  I know, but I wasn't being a very good co-host. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6287.02s)]
*  That's on, I blame myself. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6288.9800000000005s)]
*  I knew you were looking up something. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6289.820000000001s)]
*  You hate when I look up stuff on the pod. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6291.860000000001s)]
*  Every now and then, when you start throwing around [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6293.900000000001s)]
*  second apron shit, I'm like, let me make sure. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6295.34s)]
*  But it's lost cause, and then I get a text from Bobby Marks [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6297.9800000000005s)]
*  like the next day going, here's why that wouldn't work. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6300.1s)]
*  I'm like, damn it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6302.02s)]
*  Yeah, Bobby Marks, I think he's just made it [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6302.860000000001s)]
*  less fun for the rest of us, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6306.1s)]
*  because he's so on it in every single aspect of the cap. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6307.620000000001s)]
*  We can't compete. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6310.700000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6313.42s)]
*  No, it's made me think about getting back [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6314.26s)]
*  to understanding all of it again, because- [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6316.34s)]
*  But even if you tried to do it, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6318.82s)]
*  you would never be close to the level he's already at. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6320.42s)]
*  No, no. It's daunting. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6322.94s)]
*  No, no, it is very daunting. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6324.34s)]
*  And I think the problem is we could always default [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6326.0199999999995s)]
*  to third teaming it. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6328.259999999999s)]
*  That was my favorite move. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6329.82s)]
*  I know you loved it too. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6330.98s)]
*  But does that work? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6332.46s)]
*  You'd be like, hey, third team it, dude. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6333.5s)]
*  There's somebody there, and now it's like, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6335.139999999999s)]
*  you guys can't third team it the way you used to, buddy. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6337.0199999999995s)]
*  Bobby Marks just comes in like Will Hunting. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6340.139999999999s)]
*  And we're like the professor, and he's just like, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6343.58s)]
*  you know how fucking easy this is for me? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6345.26s)]
*  It's a fucking joke. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NDsvAYcjU&t=6348.34s)]
