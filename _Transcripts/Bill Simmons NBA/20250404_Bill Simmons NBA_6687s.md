# Lakers-Warriors Takeaways, ‘White Lotus’, Half-Baked Ideas and More! | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI)
*  I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=0.0s)]
*  record this a little before 10 o'clock Pacific time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=24.0s)]
*  Rob Mahoney is here from the prestige TV podcast. Oh wait, you do basketball too. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=26.8s)]
*  I forgot. Occasionally. Yeah. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=31.8s)]
*  Uh, so we watched some basketball just now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=33.8s)]
*  Warriors Lakers, a game that they used to kind of shove down our throats and we [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=35.8s)]
*  used to like it cause Stefan LeBron were playing, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=40.8s)]
*  but they were two ultimately harmless teams and now they're actual contenders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=42.8s)]
*  And it was a fascinating enough matchup with a lot at stake. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=46.8s)]
*  And we decided to wait until afterwards to do a little pot about it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=50.8s)]
*  So what'd you learn? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=53.8s)]
*  What was your number one thing you learned? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=54.8s)]
*  Uh, this game was sick. Really enjoyed it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=55.8s)]
*  Everybody, everybody involved has still got it to the extent that they needed to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=58.8s)]
*  prove that they still got it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=62.8s)]
*  And I mean, uh, the game of Brandon Pajemski is life. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=63.8s)]
*  One of the games of Austin Reeves is life. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=66.8s)]
*  I was, this game was weird, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=68.8s)]
*  but I think representative of both teams in that it was half absolute slog. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=70.8s)]
*  Like the, the middle part of this game I thought was really slow. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=74.8s)]
*  The rhythm of the game felt really disjointed and yet the shot making was at [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=78.8s)]
*  such a high level and overall like the veteran execution was at such a high [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=82.8s)]
*  level by both teams and spots by obviously by the warriors in greater numbers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=85.8s)]
*  I, uh, I wanted to figure out one thing to overreact to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=90.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=95.8s)]
*  That's what we do on these Thursday night pods after I'm a little groggy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=96.8s)]
*  I don't know if the Lakers can rebound and defend at the level you need to be to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=101.8s)]
*  actually win four straight playoff rounds for nine straight weeks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=105.8s)]
*  And that was in the back of my head this whole time that these guys were so [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=109.8s)]
*  talented, the three guys together that maybe it would have matter. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=113.8s)]
*  And then you watch a game like this when they're getting, you know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=116.8s)]
*  how many the words had 14 offensive rebounds. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=119.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=124.8s)]
*  You know, they, they were, I wouldn't say hunting different matchups, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=125.8s)]
*  but they certainly got a lot of threes that they liked. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=129.8s)]
*  They ended up going 19 for 42 from three. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=131.8s)]
*  Um, and defensively they basically was small ball against small ball. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=134.8s)]
*  Which the lawyers are like delighted to do that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=138.8s)]
*  Um, so if I'm the Lakers, I'm not too upset cause Luke didn't play well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=140.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=145.8s)]
*  Um, on the other hand, I didn't get anything from my bench and I really have [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=146.8s)]
*  an issue at center. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=151.8s)]
*  I don't have, I have Hayes and that's about it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=153.8s)]
*  And I'm playing Rui and I have this oversized. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=156.8s)]
*  I have some size, but it goes back to that Mark Williams trade, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=158.8s)]
*  which is still, you know, could be a sliding doors, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=161.8s)]
*  whatever for the, for the season for them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=166.8s)]
*  But if he came into the game today, if what we saw from him after the trade [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=168.8s)]
*  deadline, that's at least changing what the warriors have to do a little bit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=172.8s)]
*  Now they're like, oh shit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=176.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=177.8s)]
*  I guess we've got to play looney for a couple of minutes here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=178.8s)]
*  I think small ball gets small by just like the word is chances more. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=180.8s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=183.8s)]
*  They're just, I mean, they're better practice that at Jimmy Butler included. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=184.8s)]
*  Like you just playing this way in Miami for a long time too, in stretches, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=186.8s)]
*  uh, especially as like a small ball four. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=189.8s)]
*  But when you think about the Mark Williams element or the Jackson Hayes shadow [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=192.8s)]
*  element, however you want to define it, uh, they're guarding Steph so aggressively [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=196.8s)]
*  that he's having to cut and he's having to drive against that kind of top [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=200.8s)]
*  locking. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=203.8s)]
*  And so if you have a rim protector there, all those Steph drives don't look so [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=204.8s)]
*  cute anymore. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=207.8s)]
*  Now all those are, that's a really complicated premise to have to navigate [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=208.8s)]
*  for Curry, especially when he has a pelvic contusion or whatever it was coming [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=211.8s)]
*  back from not words I like in conjunction with one another. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=215.8s)]
*  Uh, but he, he played really well and he was able to play really well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=218.8s)]
*  Because ultimately the Lakers are, they are small ball. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=221.8s)]
*  They also have a certain kind of beef in size in terms of a lot of small forward [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=225.8s)]
*  and power forward shaped guys. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=230.8s)]
*  But I just have constant questions as to whether that size is real or not. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=232.8s)]
*  Is that tangible in a way that's going to impact games? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=236.8s)]
*  Cause they are not by rule, like an offensive rebounding jug or not. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=238.8s)]
*  They are not a team that really pushes people around. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=242.8s)]
*  Like they can create advantages offensively with that size, but if they're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=245.8s)]
*  not leveraging on a defense, how are they going to survive against some of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=248.8s)]
*  these higher leverage matchups? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=252.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're not tall, but they're big. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=253.8s)]
*  They're big. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=256.8s)]
*  But then in games like this, where it's just, you see the other team that has, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=258.8s)]
*  that could move the ball around and get to the rim that has a bunch of different [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=262.8s)]
*  options that has bench scoring that can exploit their bench against the Lakers [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=267.8s)]
*  bench. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=271.8s)]
*  And you start to get a little nervous. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=272.8s)]
*  I mean, Curry finished with 37, 10 for 21 is starting to play his way towards [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=274.8s)]
*  second team. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=279.8s)]
*  I feel like mine already because it does seem like Brunson's coming back in time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=280.8s)]
*  And I, do you believe in legacy stuff at all with this? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=286.8s)]
*  Like, do you feel like, uh, almost like in boxing where you got to actually beat [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=290.8s)]
*  the champ to take the title? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=294.8s)]
*  Like if it's he's on the bubble, second team or third team, same for LeBron. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=295.8s)]
*  It's like, ah, I'm going to edge you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=300.8s)]
*  I'm going to edge you towards second team for the pedigree. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=303.8s)]
*  I don't, maybe that's not the right way to think about it, but I, for both of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=306.8s)]
*  those guys, that's what I'm probably going to end up doing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=309.8s)]
*  Cause the pedigree, it's very generous of you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=311.8s)]
*  And if you're going to be generous towards somebody and make it the all time [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=313.8s)]
*  legends who are in our midst. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=316.8s)]
*  So I can't really argue with it too much for me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=317.8s)]
*  It's more like if you are LeBron, if you are Steph and I see you sliding towards [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=320.8s)]
*  a team that feels not representative of who you are for your career, maybe I give [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=324.8s)]
*  it like another look. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=328.8s)]
*  It's like, okay, that doesn't feel quite right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=329.8s)]
*  Let's make sure I'm picking Jaren Jackson Jr. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=331.8s)]
*  Over LeBron James. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=334.8s)]
*  And I feel okay about that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=335.8s)]
*  No disrespect to Jaren Jackson Jr. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=336.8s)]
*  Is amazing, but he's not LeBron. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=338.8s)]
*  So they do deserve that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=339.8s)]
*  If nothing else, a little courtesy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=341.8s)]
*  Well, the Warriors are 20 and four since that Butler trade in the game. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=343.8s)]
*  So he's actually played. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=346.8s)]
*  He was quiet today for the most part, but also wasn't quiet. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=348.8s)]
*  I felt like he was president in the game. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=351.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=353.8s)]
*  And then there was a couple of spots where he took over and he would get to the, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=354.8s)]
*  he just, he has a sense for when they meet. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=357.8s)]
*  I really liked the way this team plays together. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=359.8s)]
*  The cominga piece was the question for me trying to shoehorn him in and you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=361.8s)]
*  could have, like, I even looked at his props today heading into the game and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=366.8s)]
*  like his over under for points was 13 and a half. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=370.8s)]
*  And I was thinking like, that feels way too high to me, but I also wouldn't be [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=372.8s)]
*  surprised if that's way too low. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=377.8s)]
*  It was one of those. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=378.8s)]
*  And then, you know, he was out there for big stretches and lunchtime. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=379.8s)]
*  They're playing him and Draymond, Pudzemsky, Curry and Butler. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=383.8s)]
*  And that was their five. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=386.8s)]
*  And it was, it's interesting because I don't know, I don't know if we've seen [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=387.8s)]
*  those five guys together in a big situation like that before they had size. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=390.8s)]
*  They comingo was doing the thing where he's kind of floating around the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=395.8s)]
*  baseline and doing these weird little back cuts. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=399.8s)]
*  They could switch a little bit on defense with all that, but it also helps [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=401.8s)]
*  that Pudzemsky had, you know, as you said, one of the best games of his career. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=405.8s)]
*  But the cominga thing, would you see, would you notice? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=409.8s)]
*  I think this was the first time I've ever seen a team like this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=411.8s)]
*  What would you say? Would you notice? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=414.8s)]
*  I think this was the best that he and Butler in particular have played together. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=415.8s)]
*  And they haven't had, it's like nine or 10 games maybe that they've been able [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=419.8s)]
*  to actually be out there at the same time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=422.8s)]
*  And it's one of those things where Butler is such like an intuitive player in [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=424.8s)]
*  terms of the flow of the game. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=428.8s)]
*  You put him out there with Draymond and Steph, like he gets how to move. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=429.8s)]
*  He gets how to connect and make the right passes and find the flow. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=432.8s)]
*  I would not say Jonathan Kuminga is a terribly intuitive player. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=435.8s)]
*  It took him like three years to figure out how to play with Steph Curry. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=439.8s)]
*  The idea that he's just going to jump in and now Jimmy Butler, another kind of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=442.8s)]
*  like iffy spacer, a funky player to have to find your way with. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=445.8s)]
*  Jimmy Butler makes spacers and bigs better. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=449.8s)]
*  Does he make players like him better traditionally? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=451.8s)]
*  It's a little bit more of a mixed bag. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=454.8s)]
*  And so the data with them two on the floor coming into this game was mostly terrible. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=456.8s)]
*  Those minutes just had not worked. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=461.8s)]
*  This felt like some real signs of life for a combination that if the Warriors are [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=463.8s)]
*  going to make any kind of run, actually does need to work. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=467.8s)]
*  What was funny about what you said about the Lakers of like, if that they may not [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=470.8s)]
*  have enough to string together consecutive series with their defense, I feel the exact [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=474.8s)]
*  opposite way about the Warriors where it's like they need to prove they can string [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=479.8s)]
*  it together offensively to not just beat anyone in a series, but to beat four [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=482.8s)]
*  anyones in a row. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=486.8s)]
*  Like that's, that's a lot to ask. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=487.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=489.8s)]
*  Well, the Kuminga, the on-off numbers with him were pretty, pretty rough, even [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=490.8s)]
*  though it was a limited sample size. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=495.8s)]
*  They were really good with Santos, kind of strangely good with Post too. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=497.8s)]
*  And Post was out there today doing the whole, I'm not afraid of anybody. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=501.8s)]
*  I'm not afraid of you LeBron. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=505.8s)]
*  Talking shit LeBron was like, what's going on with this guy? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=507.8s)]
*  But Kuminga against the Lakers has always been interesting because athletically, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=510.8s)]
*  size-wise, physicality-wise, he can kind of battle and bounce with those dudes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=516.8s)]
*  And I always feel like Kerr likes throwing him out there against the Lakers because [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=521.8s)]
*  you know, Kuminga, the best thing about him is he's like, oh, LeBron, James and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=525.8s)]
*  I are equals. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=529.8s)]
*  You guys didn't realize we're in the same plane in the NBA pyramid. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=530.8s)]
*  Well, sometimes that works out. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=535.8s)]
*  Like they're very close to the season where Brandon Pajemski thought he was the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=536.8s)]
*  player Austin Reeves is right now. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=539.8s)]
*  And that's now paying off. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=541.8s)]
*  Like he's now figuring out his way into the lineup and it's, it's really working [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=543.8s)]
*  this new starting group for Golden State. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=546.8s)]
*  So I think I'm a little higher on the Warriors than you, it sounds like. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=548.8s)]
*  From a ceiling standpoint. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=551.8s)]
*  I actually really like where they are. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=554.8s)]
*  What are your hesitations? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=556.8s)]
*  I think it's just stringing it all together. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=558.8s)]
*  And I think the toll it takes on anybody to play small. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=560.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=563.8s)]
*  Like you see this with the Lakers too. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=564.8s)]
*  Like I'm still trying to figure out are the Lakers the elite defense that they were [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=565.8s)]
*  for like the first month after the Luka trade or the garbage defense we've seen [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=569.8s)]
*  over the last month or so. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=573.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=574.8s)]
*  Golden State isn't that polar, but there are going to be matchups that are tough for [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=575.8s)]
*  them. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=578.8s)]
*  There's going to be matchups that just require a ton of Draymond Green in particular, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=579.8s)]
*  a ton of Jimmy Butler in particular. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=582.8s)]
*  And then you're playing multiple small guards in a lot of these looks. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=584.8s)]
*  And so all of a sudden the toll of that for three series in a row, I think might [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=587.8s)]
*  just be a little bit too much. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=592.8s)]
*  And so it's the kind of thing where I would, I think they can beat, they can [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=593.8s)]
*  upset anyone in the first round. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=597.8s)]
*  I think they have that in them. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=598.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=600.8s)]
*  But chaining those series together against really formidable Western [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=601.8s)]
*  conference opponents where everyone's kind of in the same relative class. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=604.8s)]
*  I think that might just be a lot. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=607.8s)]
*  Well, they interviewed JJ before the fourth quarter with Ali Laforce and he was [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=609.8s)]
*  friendly and Kurt, I mean, unfriendly and Kurt. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=614.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=617.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=618.8s)]
*  He just was like, you could tell he was just really pissed off about how the game [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=619.8s)]
*  was going. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=623.8s)]
*  And I was trying to figure out what pissed them off, whether it was like, I can't [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=624.8s)]
*  believe Pudzemsky really he's going to make all those shots or I don't like [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=628.8s)]
*  something we're doing defensively. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=632.8s)]
*  Maybe it was a bunch of stuff. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=634.8s)]
*  The thing that was pretty weird about this game, again, try not to overreact. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=636.8s)]
*  But I thought we were trying to overreact. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=641.8s)]
*  Well, I'm trying not to now because it's Luka Donchich and he's one of the best [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=644.8s)]
*  players in the world. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=648.8s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=649.8s)]
*  It was a pretty uninspiring performance by him tonight. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=650.8s)]
*  I'm not really sure what was going on with him. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=654.8s)]
*  He seemed out of it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=657.8s)]
*  He wasn't even like really bitching at the refs as much as he used it as he [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=658.8s)]
*  didn't seem upset at anyone on the Warriors. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=662.8s)]
*  And just in general, it was a strange performance for him. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=664.8s)]
*  He was the third best guy in his own team and arguably the fourth best guy [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=668.8s)]
*  because he was really good tonight, too. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=672.8s)]
*  And that's the one I thought the Warriors were going to have so much trouble [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=674.8s)]
*  matching up with him, but they seem like they matched up really well with him. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=678.8s)]
*  He was still doing some good kick out passes. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=681.8s)]
*  He was starting to size around, but it just was not your typical Luka game. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=683.8s)]
*  And LeBron, who started out slow, I think sensed it pretty early and he really [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=687.8s)]
*  came on and was just able to flip this switch and ended up with over 30. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=691.8s)]
*  But I don't know what to make of the Luka thing. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=696.8s)]
*  I think the Luka Laker experience has been pretty weird. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=698.8s)]
*  There's been like flashes of just all time crazy brilliance. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=702.8s)]
*  He'll be amazing and not that great in the same game and up and down. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=706.8s)]
*  And it seems like he's in better shape than he was defensively. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=711.8s)]
*  It's still not good. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=714.8s)]
*  He was really rough tonight. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=715.8s)]
*  And I'm going to say work in progress, but we've had this is two plus months now. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=718.8s)]
*  For sure. I just like work in progress. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=723.8s)]
*  Luka, though, is still pretty damn good. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=725.8s)]
*  Yes. He's still creating opportunities that basically no other players on the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=727.8s)]
*  floor can create. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=731.8s)]
*  I thought he did a good job of at least of not stopping short on drives and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=732.8s)]
*  especially in transition where he can tend to slow things down and want to [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=737.8s)]
*  reset the offense. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=740.8s)]
*  And he was going all the way to the rim, whether to set himself up, whether to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=741.8s)]
*  set up threes, whether to set up lobs. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=744.8s)]
*  Really continuing to push himself a little bit. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=746.8s)]
*  And any time that he and LeBron and Reeves get involved in the same like [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=749.8s)]
*  triangulated action, it's fucking terrifying. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=753.8s)]
*  You can see the bones of something that is really, really scary. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=756.8s)]
*  It's just to your point, not there every single play with Luka. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=759.8s)]
*  The burst isn't there every single play. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=762.8s)]
*  The touch kind of comes and goes depending on the game, especially if you're [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=764.8s)]
*  setting the step back threes. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=767.8s)]
*  That's always been a huge variable for him. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=769.8s)]
*  But he's still good enough. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=771.8s)]
*  And ultimately it's not a real concern for the Lakers relative to the fact that [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=773.8s)]
*  they have this completely turned over team that is not going to make sense [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=778.8s)]
*  until they have a chance to go into an off season and build a Luka style [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=782.8s)]
*  roster around him. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=785.8s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=787.8s)]
*  One of the things I noticed with them, and I'm wondering if the Warriors [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=789.8s)]
*  unlocked it a little bit. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=792.8s)]
*  Because JJ, this team is such a weird team to coach that I think he was doing [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=794.8s)]
*  some math formula stuff with them almost where it's like Luka's going to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=798.8s)]
*  take over the first eight minutes of the game. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=802.8s)]
*  I'm going to play Luka by himself and LeBron and Reeves together. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=805.8s)]
*  And I'm basically turning the game into like nine, 10 different segments. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=809.8s)]
*  And the segments are going to go like this. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=815.8s)]
*  And then in the fourth quarter we'll do this. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=818.8s)]
*  And it felt like the Warriors were kind of ready for all the segments. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=820.8s)]
*  It's like, oh, we know what you're going to do in the first eight minutes. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=824.8s)]
*  You're going to get Luka going. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=826.8s)]
*  Well, we're not going to let him go. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=828.8s)]
*  Get going. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=829.8s)]
*  And just on and on it kind of went. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=830.8s)]
*  And the one variable they couldn't really prepare for is LeBron just all of a [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=832.8s)]
*  sudden was just playing great. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=836.8s)]
*  Yeah, just turning it up. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=838.8s)]
*  But I do feel like it's just a little bit gimmicky still with the Lakers, as [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=839.8s)]
*  talented as they are. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=843.8s)]
*  Because to not have room protection, to play those three guys at the same time. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=845.8s)]
*  And LeBron has been so much better on defense. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=850.8s)]
*  I don't know how sustainable that is when we're playing every other day in the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=852.8s)]
*  playoffs. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=855.8s)]
*  But Luka and Reeves out there at the same time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=856.8s)]
*  It's just it's really tough when you're playing a slash and kick team like the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=858.8s)]
*  one today. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=861.8s)]
*  Plus Butler, there was a couple of times he was like, oh, you're putting this [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=862.8s)]
*  guy on me. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=865.8s)]
*  And he would just go right to the basket. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=866.8s)]
*  So it's a weird team. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=867.8s)]
*  I'm still afraid of them. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=869.8s)]
*  If you talk, I've talked to a couple of former famous players who are all the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=870.8s)]
*  famous players who used to play are really high in this Lakers team, I think [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=876.8s)]
*  except Barkley, just because they see like the talent and the potential. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=880.8s)]
*  But I wonder, could that end up being this team's legacy? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=884.8s)]
*  Are we seeing things that maybe aren't quite there, but we're projecting what we [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=887.8s)]
*  think is there? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=893.8s)]
*  Or is this just a team that can't really rebound or defend anybody? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=894.8s)]
*  I think the defense, it does come and go. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=897.8s)]
*  And I think the room protection thing is really instructive here because they [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=901.8s)]
*  don't have by not having a traditional defensive anchor. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=904.8s)]
*  The only way they play elite defense is flying around, playing with incredible [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=907.8s)]
*  effort and focus all the time. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=911.8s)]
*  And so it's not a huge surprise that they can't do that every single game. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=913.8s)]
*  It's not a huge surprise. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=917.8s)]
*  They can't chain it together for five games at a time. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=918.8s)]
*  Sometimes it's just going to be a little bit more of a, you know, a peaks and [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=921.8s)]
*  valleys kind of experience for them on that end. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=925.8s)]
*  I think ultimately you're banking on the playmaking. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=927.8s)]
*  And this is where I can kind of see the logic in the segmenting the game that [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=930.8s)]
*  you're talking about. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=933.8s)]
*  It's like, if you have two of the most creative people in the sport, the idea [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=934.8s)]
*  of, oh, I'm going to put these very orderly boxes in place and I'm going to [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=937.8s)]
*  trust these geniuses to navigate it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=941.8s)]
*  That's a pretty good premise as far as I'm concerned. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=944.8s)]
*  Yeah, I watched the Indiana Laker game with my dad last week. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=947.8s)]
*  And the one thing I don't think this Lakers team is going to be and the Pacers [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=951.8s)]
*  wouldn't do it all the time. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=954.8s)]
*  We were going nuts because we're just rooting against the Lakers. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=955.8s)]
*  We're just like spread them out. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=958.8s)]
*  Go to the basket, spread them out. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=959.8s)]
*  Go to the basket, spread them out. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=960.8s)]
*  Go to the basket. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=961.8s)]
*  And then sometimes Indiana would just settle for at least 26 footers like, dude, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=962.8s)]
*  just go to the basket. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=967.8s)]
*  You're going to get to the basket. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=968.8s)]
*  And I think more and more teams are starting to realize this. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=970.8s)]
*  Just go to the basket. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=973.8s)]
*  There's going to be nobody waiting for you. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=974.8s)]
*  We're going to get there on the on the Lakers side. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=976.8s)]
*  I just think LeBron's playing unbelievable. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=979.8s)]
*  So good. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=982.8s)]
*  I just I don't really understand it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=983.8s)]
*  From an all around standpoint, it's probably this is the most he's looked like [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=986.8s)]
*  2013 range LeBron. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=992.8s)]
*  Like he was 10 for 15 tonight. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=995.8s)]
*  He's like he's taking a shitload of shots and has the ball all the time. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=997.8s)]
*  He's like picking his spots, the defense. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1001.8s)]
*  He's trying to rebound. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1003.8s)]
*  He didn't really rebound tonight as much as he usually has. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1004.8s)]
*  But the all around stuff's been really great. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1007.8s)]
*  I don't know if that's sustainable. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1010.8s)]
*  When we get to mid April going every other day. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1013.8s)]
*  Big picture. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1016.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1017.8s)]
*  Neither of these teams wants that playing game. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1018.8s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1020.8s)]
*  That's just extra miles on the car. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1021.8s)]
*  I'm like, oh, we're going to go all the way cross-country that way. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1023.8s)]
*  But on the way, we're going to go this way and stop at the Grand Canyon. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1026.8s)]
*  Like they don't want to stop at the Grand Canyon. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1029.8s)]
*  It's just like we want this trip to be straight as possible. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1031.8s)]
*  Lakers are four. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1034.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1035.8s)]
*  Golden State is five. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1036.8s)]
*  Normally that sounds great. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1037.8s)]
*  But the T Wolves are seven, one behind the Warriors in the last column. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1038.8s)]
*  And then the Lakers are two over them and the Grizzlies who won an amazing game tonight against Miami. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1042.8s)]
*  It was like I was one of I watched it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1050.8s)]
*  It was one of those. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1052.8s)]
*  I don't know who's winning this game. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1053.8s)]
*  And then Jah once again comes through at the end. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1054.8s)]
*  Crazy shot. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1056.8s)]
*  Right when it seemed like Memphis was just going to free fall into the eighth seed. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1057.8s)]
*  And it was like, oh, shit. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1061.8s)]
*  OK, Memphis, we have our NBA TV series. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1063.8s)]
*  I don't need to watch one second of this. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1065.8s)]
*  We're going for a sweep. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1067.8s)]
*  But Memphis wins. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1068.8s)]
*  And now this is a mess. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1069.8s)]
*  And I don't I don't know how much you want to do on Western Conference playoff roulette. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1070.8s)]
*  But the only thing I can think is I would just much rather be in that two, three area so I don't have to see OKC for a little while. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1075.8s)]
*  And I wonder as we get into the final week, who starts getting a little chicanerous. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1086.8s)]
*  Just made up that word to try to nudge their way. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1094.8s)]
*  Like I have my eye on Denver. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1098.8s)]
*  Well, they certainly don't seem to care about the standings too much. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1100.8s)]
*  Plus that Minnesota game, I think I think they're like, whatever. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1103.8s)]
*  We made the chips fall where they may. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1106.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1108.8s)]
*  If I'm the Lakers, I don't want to see OKC until round three because that's the one team I don't think the Lakers can beat. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1110.8s)]
*  And they do think I'm crazy. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1116.8s)]
*  I just don't like that matchup for them in any way, shape or form. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1117.8s)]
*  If you are any basketball team, you don't want to see OKC until round three or the NBA Finals. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1120.8s)]
*  Like those are the only options that you would prefer. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1125.8s)]
*  So but as far as the chicanery goes, that's a real fine line you're trying to walk. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1127.8s)]
*  To basically get to six and lock in at six is the ideal spot if you're going to be in the four, five, six range. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1132.8s)]
*  Because four and five, yeah, you're going to be potentially roadkill for the Thunder who look just increasingly incredible, to be honest with you. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1138.8s)]
*  And I want no part of that team. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1145.8s)]
*  64-12 plus 13.4. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1147.8s)]
*  I mean, I think they beat everybody. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1153.8s)]
*  They're so good. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1155.8s)]
*  And Yoko just having the best year of his career and with six games left, I don't think I'm going to vote for him for MVP. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1156.8s)]
*  Oh, you're sealed up. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1164.8s)]
*  I'm not sealed up, but I'm like 98 percent there. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1165.8s)]
*  OK. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1168.8s)]
*  I just feel like we're going to be in the high 60s with the OKC team. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1169.8s)]
*  And it's not you can't do the thing where. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1173.8s)]
*  Wow, you know, you can put anybody in that top spot. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1175.8s)]
*  That team's still really good because every game I've watched and all the games I've seen OKC in person, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1179.8s)]
*  nobody can guard Shay Gildes Alexander. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1184.8s)]
*  No, nobody in the league. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1186.8s)]
*  I haven't. I saw that against the Clippers game I went to last week. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1188.8s)]
*  He had a bad shooting game, but he all the shots were good. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1191.8s)]
*  They just didn't go in. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1194.8s)]
*  And that's a team with, I would say, three all defense caliber players on its rosters. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1195.8s)]
*  They made him work for everything. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1200.8s)]
*  He still got all the shots he wanted. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1201.8s)]
*  And he's like shaking his head because he's like, I can't believe this isn't going in tonight. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1203.8s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1207.8s)]
*  With that said, I don't think Minnesota would be afraid of them at all. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1208.8s)]
*  I'm not defending it, but I just don't think that team has fear of any matchup. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1213.8s)]
*  And I think they would waltz into that series and be like, yeah, sure, let's beat them. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1218.8s)]
*  And that's the team they could see. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1223.8s)]
*  And I think the Clippers know they can play with them because they've had really good games against them. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1224.8s)]
*  Yeah. Whether they can beat them, I don't know, but they're not going to be afraid of them. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1228.8s)]
*  So I would say, OK, see, those are the two I wouldn't be like super pumped about. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1230.8s)]
*  The Clippers are no fun to play against for anybody. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1235.8s)]
*  And frankly, when Kawhi Leonard plays, they just do not lose. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1239.8s)]
*  Except I think they lost randomly to the Pelicans one time. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1242.8s)]
*  We don't have to talk about that. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1245.8s)]
*  Other than that, really just have turned into an offensive buzzsaw in a way that should be terrifying because they were already such a great defense. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1246.8s)]
*  The Wolves, I am really becoming a believer. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1253.8s)]
*  Oh, make the case. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1258.8s)]
*  This was a team that I was I was really down on come December or so. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1259.8s)]
*  I just thought the energy with the team was so off. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1264.8s)]
*  I thought the defense was so underwhelming. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1266.8s)]
*  I didn't really see the vision in the Randall thing at all. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1268.8s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, everything's starting to click. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1271.8s)]
*  Like all the everyone who was hurt is suddenly back and playing well. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1273.8s)]
*  Then the new additions, both Randall and Devin Chenzo in particular, both really hitting at this point. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1277.8s)]
*  Randall's playing, I think, some of the best basketball of his career. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1282.8s)]
*  Frankly, I don't know how to feel about the kind of person who is telling you and many people on a podcast. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1284.8s)]
*  They should believe in Julius Randall, playoff performer. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1289.8s)]
*  That's a that's a big ask of anybody. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1292.8s)]
*  But I find myself as we're kind of charting the Western Conference landscape and I'm looking at teams like Golden State and the Lakers teams that could win around, but maybe not two or three. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1294.8s)]
*  I'm seeing teams like Houston that I think can win with the right matchup, but otherwise might be out on their luck if they hold the wrong one. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1305.8s)]
*  Teams like Denver that frankly, not only do they not care about seeding, they don't seem to be terribly interested in playing defense in a lot of games. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1312.8s)]
*  And I expect the playoffs will be different, but even still, the personnel is what it is. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1319.8s)]
*  And I just find my way back to the Wolfs. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1323.8s)]
*  I'm thinking they have the high end talent. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1325.8s)]
*  They have the depth. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1327.8s)]
*  They have the defense. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1328.8s)]
*  They have the bodies. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1329.8s)]
*  They have versatility to actually roll with the punches of a playoff series. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1330.8s)]
*  And frankly, we've seen all this stuff in action in a slightly different form with Kat versus Randall and you know, no Devin Chenzo. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1334.8s)]
*  I just I really like what they're putting together. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1341.8s)]
*  I think they're playing great basketball right now. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1344.8s)]
*  Yeah, and all the advanced stats back it up and they can shoot and I'm with you. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1346.8s)]
*  I'm never going to love Randall, but there's a physicality with them. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1351.8s)]
*  If we're all being honest. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1355.8s)]
*  But there's a physicality with them lately that I think there's a little bit more of an identity to the team as a whole when you watch them where they've got size identity and and is just there's no there's no player on any other team that he doesn't think he's better than for better and worse. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1357.8s)]
*  And that's just the way it goes. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1371.8s)]
*  I thought Denver, Minnesota. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1373.8s)]
*  I thought that other night I had already put my pot up with Zach on Tuesday before those two games and to watch Curry and Yocage do that back to back. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1375.8s)]
*  I know you guys talked about it in your pod, but just that five hours of two of the great offensive players in the history of the league really, really having a night. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1383.8s)]
*  And it just was all in a row. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1393.8s)]
*  And it got to the point with the Nuggets and it seemed like so many different times they had that game or they were going to lose that game. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1395.8s)]
*  And then it really seemed like they had it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1401.8s)]
*  And then Russ, who is just wandering around with a fucking pitchfork ready to just stab somebody with it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1403.8s)]
*  Just hit me. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1412.8s)]
*  Crunch times. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1413.8s)]
*  You're just terrified. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1414.8s)]
*  He's the Texas Chainsaw Massacre guy. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1415.8s)]
*  If you're rooting for Denver, but he's not even doing that. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1417.8s)]
*  He's stabbing himself. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1419.8s)]
*  He's like falling on his own rake over and over. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1420.8s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1423.8s)]
*  He was already horrible in the crunch time overtime section where there was eight times. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1424.8s)]
*  We're like, just just take them out. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1430.8s)]
*  You're better off just not having them out there. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1432.8s)]
*  He just didn't have it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1433.8s)]
*  And then he has that stretch in the last 10 seconds. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1435.8s)]
*  And it was one of those games where you're like, when we get to game 82 and Sunday and we're trying to figure out the playoff matchups, I feel like we're going to go back to that game and be like, remember that stupid game when Russ screwed up the Denver game. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1437.8s)]
*  And now now Denver's in the in the four spot playing the Lakers in the four or five and then the loser or the winner plays OKC and they could have been three and played Houston around to just felt like one of those. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1450.8s)]
*  And conversely, Minnesota, who if they can get to the even if they're in the seven eight and they can get that seven. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1463.8s)]
*  But I just want to play Houston. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1471.8s)]
*  That's where I've landed with all these things. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1473.8s)]
*  I want to play Houston. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1475.8s)]
*  I want to play Memphis. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1476.8s)]
*  Those are the two teams that I just think are a level below all these other ones. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1477.8s)]
*  I think the exception to that would be if Denver slides and ends up somehow in the play in which is not incomprehensible. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1480.8s)]
*  These teams are really bunched up. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1488.8s)]
*  Yes, they'd have to drop two more. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1490.8s)]
*  It looks like they have to drop a couple of spots. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1492.8s)]
*  I think the Rockets could give the Nuggets a real run. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1494.8s)]
*  I think that's a tough matchup for them. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1496.8s)]
*  And I say this knowing the like the Rockets just blew a game against Denver with no Nikola Jokic. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1498.8s)]
*  I'm acknowledging it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1504.8s)]
*  It happened. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1505.8s)]
*  I don't think it's representative of the matchup. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1506.8s)]
*  I think if you give these perimeter demons a chance to make Jamal Murray's life a living hell for seven games, I think they will do it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1508.8s)]
*  I think they have enough size to really dump things up. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1515.8s)]
*  I think they're so physical. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1517.8s)]
*  And that's really the question with Houston is what teams would really be bothered by high end athleticism and high end physicality. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1519.8s)]
*  I think Denver might be one of those teams, despite the fact that their lineups are quite big themselves. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1526.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1530.8s)]
*  The other thing that really helps Houston is their half court in the last six, seven, eight minutes is pretty brutal. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1531.8s)]
*  It can be. But against Denver's defense, then you have some doesn't have to be that brutal. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1537.8s)]
*  Not going to play the worst turnovers working in your favor. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1541.8s)]
*  You know, you got three opportunities on the board. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1544.8s)]
*  Well, those guys hit every they're going to have their team. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1546.8s)]
*  Hopefully in this last week, Russ, I just can't imagine he sees crunch time again. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1549.8s)]
*  You can't do it. It's too risky. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1554.8s)]
*  Probably the Warriors on Friday night. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1556.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1558.8s)]
*  And the season with the Rockets, which could be an all time. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1559.8s)]
*  Wait, what are these two teams up to? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1563.8s)]
*  We're just guys. One team's just scratching multiple starters right before right before we go. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1565.8s)]
*  Are we still doing the the last day of the season like all the games are basically happening at the same time to prevent this sort of chicanery? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1571.8s)]
*  Is that still is that still going on? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1578.8s)]
*  Did that work? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1580.8s)]
*  But then they do like they eat. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1582.8s)]
*  They did the non games and then the important games. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1583.8s)]
*  Then they stagger them in some way. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1585.8s)]
*  I mean, all you're really doing is forcing an assistant coach to sit on the back row with an iPad. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1587.8s)]
*  You know, like they're still going to be watching. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1591.8s)]
*  Well, so then the other piece is this Dallas, Sacramento, Phoenix factory of sadness and Portland somehow still alive, even though they they're just like, can we just get Cooper flag? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1594.8s)]
*  Oh, no, we want to get Dallas at 38, 39 Sacramento, 36 and 40 and Phoenix at 35 and 41. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1607.8s)]
*  I mean, I've gotten to the point where I'm rooting against Phoenix because I don't want to see them in the play in. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1615.8s)]
*  But I don't want to see Sacramento in the playing either. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1620.8s)]
*  And I don't I don't want to watch Dallas at all. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1623.8s)]
*  Yeah, Dallas might host a playing game where the crowd is chanting fire. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1626.8s)]
*  Nico, but they've got a manager as the playoff as the playing games going. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1629.8s)]
*  So I just kind of want to get to the final eight and see where it goes. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1633.8s)]
*  The Clippers thing. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1637.8s)]
*  The Clippers thing is the most interesting where they land, because if that's that's just a just a horrible one eight draw for a team that goes 69 and 13. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1639.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1647.8s)]
*  Here's your reward. The Clippers. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1648.8s)]
*  They're healthy. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1649.8s)]
*  Well, they're healthy. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1650.8s)]
*  They're healthy for now. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1651.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're healthy for. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1653.8s)]
*  Yeah, I guess today. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1654.8s)]
*  Wait, before you go, Draymond Green, defensive player of the year. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1656.8s)]
*  I'm sure that helped today. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1660.8s)]
*  He had a nice big awesome stop. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1662.8s)]
*  Nationally televised game was all over the place. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1665.8s)]
*  I thought that was the most. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1667.8s)]
*  It's the Lakers. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1668.8s)]
*  He's always a little weird because I think especially when it was against LeBron and A.D. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1669.8s)]
*  And you always felt like he was kind of a tempered Draymond because those were his friends and he wasn't doing like usual Draymond shit tonight. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1673.8s)]
*  He was not tempered. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1680.8s)]
*  I thought he was very alpha and looked like the Draymond that we've become accustomed to. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1681.8s)]
*  Defensive player of the year. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1687.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's going to win. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1689.8s)]
*  Is he the defensive player of the year for you? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1691.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1694.8s)]
*  I mean, look, he's Draymond Green. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1695.8s)]
*  He deserves a he deserves consideration, probably deserves a place on the ballot at the end of the day. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1697.8s)]
*  I'm more of an Evan Mobley voter at this point. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1702.8s)]
*  Just the utility of what he brings to that defense. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1707.8s)]
*  How many how many people he's like constantly bailing out on every defensive possession. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1709.8s)]
*  Yeah, the flexibility between the four or five is not dissimilar from Draymond. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1714.8s)]
*  I just think he is an absolute monster on that. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1717.8s)]
*  And Draymond, if Draymond had been playing defensively the way he's played the last, I would say, 15 to 20 games all season, we're having a very different conversation. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1721.8s)]
*  I don't think the first part of the season, especially the first half, he was quite at this this like peak elite level. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1730.8s)]
*  This is still really high level defensive play. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1737.8s)]
*  I'm not disparaging Draymond Green. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1739.8s)]
*  He's incredible, particularly on that end of the court. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1741.8s)]
*  I just don't think he's put together the total body of work for it. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1743.8s)]
*  And it's a great point because the other one I was looking at was Lou Dohert. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1747.8s)]
*  I talked about that with Zach. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1750.8s)]
*  Just separating everything. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1753.8s)]
*  He's the best defensive player I've seen this year, but they're so afraid to give the perimeter guys that award. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1755.8s)]
*  But I just he's done the most interesting stuff on defense for me. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1761.8s)]
*  Do you take any responsibility for the perimeter gun shyness after the Marcus Smart debacle? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1765.8s)]
*  Do you think that's what what radicalized all of us? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1770.8s)]
*  It might have. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1772.8s)]
*  But that was a little bit like this year. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1774.8s)]
*  This year, I mean, the problem with this year is Wemby should win defensive player of the year every year. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1776.8s)]
*  And he got knocked out. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1780.8s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's just almost like a like a political convention where the candidate everybody thought was going to win is out. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1782.8s)]
*  And now it's all sudden there's 10 people arguing on stage. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1789.8s)]
*  I just I don't feel like any of these are like the greatest possible candidates. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1792.8s)]
*  Same thing with Rookie of the Year where it's like, all right, we got to vote for somebody. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1799.8s)]
*  There's like 50 people deserving of all defense consideration. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1804.8s)]
*  And I don't feel great about any of them necessarily as like the definitive defensive player of the year. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1807.8s)]
*  You're right. Like it's without Wemby, there is a vacuum. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1812.8s)]
*  It's unavoidable. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1815.8s)]
*  It's the most fun award subplot since it looks like MVP is a wrap. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1817.8s)]
*  Coach of the year is just like just do a shot and do a whip it and then just pick one of six guys. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1823.8s)]
*  I don't is there a wrong coach of the year choice? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1830.8s)]
*  Like I'm leaning toward Dagnaut right now and he's definitely not going to win. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1832.8s)]
*  But it's like if they win 70 games, I'm probably going to vote for him. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1836.8s)]
*  Atkinson's good. Bickerstaff's good. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1840.8s)]
*  You just pick five guys. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1843.8s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1845.8s)]
*  I feel like the Thunder like Shay, I agree, is the favorite to win MVP. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1846.8s)]
*  Probably will win MVP. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1850.8s)]
*  Otherwise, they suffer from that problem where their team is so good and there's credit going in so many different directions that Mark Dagnaut probably isn't going to get the credit he deserves. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1852.8s)]
*  Lou Dort probably isn't going to get the credit he deserves. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1861.8s)]
*  They have so many good players who are probably going to be under the threshold for games played and so they won't get consideration for various teams and things. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1863.8s)]
*  But holy shit, like there's so many places to assign credit for what OKC has done. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1870.8s)]
*  And I think if you want to talk about the reason why they won as many games as they did, it's the professionalism and the intensity they play with every single fucking game. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1875.8s)]
*  And that either comes from Mark Dagnaut or it comes from Shay or both. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1883.8s)]
*  And if you want to credit either of those guys for that, I think it's more than deserved. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1887.8s)]
*  I'll throw in this too. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1892.8s)]
*  Caruso 50 games. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1894.8s)]
*  Hartenstein 54. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1896.8s)]
*  Chet 28. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1898.8s)]
*  Jaden Williams 65. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1900.8s)]
*  It's not like this team's been a healthy juggernaut all year. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1902.8s)]
*  Like they hit the first two months of the year. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1905.8s)]
*  They didn't have a center for like one of those months. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1908.8s)]
*  None of it mattered. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1911.8s)]
*  Jalen Williams. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1912.8s)]
*  He was their center for a fucking month. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1913.8s)]
*  None of it mattered. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1915.8s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1916.8s)]
*  There you go. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1917.8s)]
*  Well, for the listeners, you could skip forward from right here if you're not watching White Lotus because I have to talk White Lotus with Rob for one minute. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1918.8s)]
*  So if you don't care about that, just skip forward ahead to Kevin Wilde's because we're going to keep going. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1925.8s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about White Lotus. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1930.8s)]
*  Stick around because I'm going to ask you about White Lotus. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1931.8s)]
*  90 minute season finale. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1933.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1935.8s)]
*  They won't send us screeners. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1936.8s)]
*  Joanna Robinson, Mallory Rubin and I are going to be downtown LA watching it live, going live right after on YouTube. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1937.8s)]
*  Have no idea what's going to happen. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1944.8s)]
*  Is this going to be crazier than we expected or is it going to be like weirdly disappointing and more like thoughtful, existential, Buddhist? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1946.8s)]
*  Like we're going to have like almost like a philosophical religious experience or is there just going to be bodies everywhere? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1958.8s)]
*  It is going to be a religious experience. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1964.8s)]
*  Also, first of all, thank you for inviting me on now the third White Lotus splinter potty. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1966.8s)]
*  We've had every permutation of host possible. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1970.8s)]
*  This is the only one left. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1972.8s)]
*  This is the only one left for the finale. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1974.8s)]
*  I will say, I don't know if this is great PR and marketing by them, but all the little quotes that are coming out from the cast hinting at the ominous results of the finale had me a little spooked. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1976.8s)]
*  And again, maybe I'm just being played. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1987.8s)]
*  I think I think the body count or the philosophical fallout is going to be pretty significant. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1989.8s)]
*  I don't I don't quite know which one yet. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1995.8s)]
*  I went back and watched the first step. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1997.8s)]
*  The first scene. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=1999.8s)]
*  Gunshot. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2001.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2002.8s)]
*  Gunshot. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2003.8s)]
*  Pause. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2005.8s)]
*  Gunshot. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2007.8s)]
*  Gunshots. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2008.8s)]
*  So did you see any monkeys holding a gun? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2009.8s)]
*  Did you see any monkeys? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2011.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2013.8s)]
*  They're going Tarantino where three different groups of people are all shooting at each other. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2015.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2020.8s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2021.8s)]
*  But in the trailer, which came out for the last episode, they really play up the poisonous fruit in the first 20 seconds, which we had talked about in our pod. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2022.8s)]
*  And you talked about on the deep dive pod about the fruit, the blender. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2032.8s)]
*  They just kept coming back to it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2037.8s)]
*  How annoying the blender is. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2038.8s)]
*  But now they put that in the trailer. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2040.8s)]
*  And now I don't know. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2042.8s)]
*  Is that a red herring or what? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2043.8s)]
*  I know, especially because I think we still have one Tim Ratliff vision yet of him wiping out his entire family at one time. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2044.8s)]
*  And maybe that is where the blender or the fruit come in is like the visualization of this terrible thing, but not actually happening. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2053.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2059.8s)]
*  He's not a good place. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2060.8s)]
*  He's just been walking around for days, stoned out of his mind, ready, ready to do something to somebody. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2061.8s)]
*  I got to say his usage rates probably been a little too high. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2067.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2070.8s)]
*  I think he's been in the corner more just for spacing. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2071.8s)]
*  Just been actually run plays for him. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2073.8s)]
*  I think he can run some plays, but like when Shay's out, you know, like make him Aaron Wiggins and then we're all going to be fine. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2075.8s)]
*  Was this the right number of episodes for you or was this six episodes stretched to seven so far? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2081.8s)]
*  I think it was a little too many. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2086.8s)]
*  I like the it's not really a pacing problem so much as when people are off screen or kind of set to the side, they just idle in place for an indefinite period of time. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2087.8s)]
*  And so that eventually I think starts to wear out. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2096.8s)]
*  It's welcome. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2099.8s)]
*  I think it should have been seven episodes just in general. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2100.8s)]
*  I think I thought first season was too short. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2103.8s)]
*  The middle season was the right length. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2106.8s)]
*  This feels a whiff long and you probably could have gotten away with sixty five minute episodes and had six of them instead of seven. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2108.8s)]
*  But just a classic Goldilocks scenario. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2116.8s)]
*  With all that said, I love the show. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2118.8s)]
*  I've been defending it to people who have, you know, year three people start to get used to the format. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2121.8s)]
*  They start pitching and complain about certain things. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2126.8s)]
*  I'm just like, this shows great. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2128.8s)]
*  I love the show. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2130.8s)]
*  I love being on vacation in some weird place. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2131.8s)]
*  I love the characters. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2133.8s)]
*  I love the mystery. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2134.8s)]
*  It's always keeping you on your toes and I'm glad it exists. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2135.8s)]
*  Extremely glad it exists. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2139.8s)]
*  I think too. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2141.8s)]
*  I think this finale is going to win some people over. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2142.8s)]
*  I think the calamity has been bottled up for this 90 minutes and maybe that's just the wrong read, but I kind of feel it in the air. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2143.8s)]
*  Who is your favorite character this season? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2150.8s)]
*  I love I mean, I love Carrie Coon. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2152.8s)]
*  So I am Lori Pilt and everything chaotic happening around her right now is just the joy to watch. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2155.8s)]
*  I can't be mad about any of it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2161.8s)]
*  Lori is also my she's my second. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2163.8s)]
*  Nah, she's my top three. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2166.8s)]
*  I'm not going to pick a favorite, but my top three are Chelsea. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2168.8s)]
*  Wait, you literally just asked me to pick a favorite. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2171.8s)]
*  You have to pick a favorite. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2174.8s)]
*  It's my podcast. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2175.8s)]
*  No, no. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2176.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2177.8s)]
*  I'll pick my favorite. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2178.8s)]
*  Chelsea's my favorite. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2179.8s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2180.8s)]
*  Lori second, Saxon third. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2181.8s)]
*  Saxon's coming up the power rankings. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2184.8s)]
*  Watching Joanna do a 180 on Saxon was was my highlight of 2025 so far. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2186.8s)]
*  One of the great joys. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2191.8s)]
*  Saxon's bringing people together as as his enlightenment processes within his tiny little brain. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2193.8s)]
*  He's just he's just bringing people together in a really a celebration of everything that he's all about. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2199.8s)]
*  So do you think Lockie? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2205.8s)]
*  Do you think he actually took the drugs? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2208.8s)]
*  Or rather than that night before the threesome? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2211.8s)]
*  Do you think he was actually drugged up? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2214.8s)]
*  You know, I some sort of weird power play with him. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2216.8s)]
*  I thought I had escaped the wake of talking about brothers jerking each other off. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2218.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2223.8s)]
*  But we get dragged back into these things. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2224.8s)]
*  I I think he did take the drugs. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2226.8s)]
*  I think I think it's maybe like paying a little too close attention to think that he spat them out. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2228.8s)]
*  But I don't know why Lotus is a show that cares about the details. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2234.8s)]
*  Maybe it's not impossible. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2237.8s)]
*  You know, I ask because my daughter, who not only watches the show, but is intently following the tick tock conversation around it and always tells me this is a big thing on tick tock right now with some dumb aspect of the show. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2238.8s)]
*  She claimed there's a tick tock where it doesn't seem like he took the drugs. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2250.8s)]
*  It definitively proves that Lockie did not take the drugs. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2254.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2257.8s)]
*  Because tick tock would never lie to us. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2258.8s)]
*  And there's no there's no devices to twist any footage around in anything. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2260.8s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2264.8s)]
*  So I can't wait. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2265.8s)]
*  White Lotus. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2267.8s)]
*  So we're doing the live one and then you're doing the deep dive a couple days later with with Joanna. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2268.8s)]
*  And then we go right to the playoffs. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2273.8s)]
*  I know rolling right into it. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2275.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2277.8s)]

*  Great time of year. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2415.8s)]
*  Is April the best take month? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2416.8s)]
*  Is this the most going on? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2418.8s)]
*  NFL draft. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2420.8s)]
*  Nobody really knows what they're talking about, but we all feel like we have to have takes on that. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2421.8s)]
*  NBA playoffs are coming up. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2425.8s)]
*  There's already NBA trade stuff happening. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2427.8s)]
*  First month of baseball season. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2429.8s)]
*  Got some baseball takes. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2431.8s)]
*  March Madness takes. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2432.8s)]
*  There's some events. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2433.8s)]
*  Some March Madness is still in there. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2434.8s)]
*  Masters is coming up. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2436.8s)]
*  I think it's the best month for talking out of your ass when you don't really know what's going on. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2437.8s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2441.8s)]
*  It's either if April is your first draft pick for takes, I would say week one NFL season that Monday or that Tuesday once the Monday night season. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2442.8s)]
*  Overreaction Monday? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2455.8s)]
*  Oh, the first overreaction Monday. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2456.8s)]
*  Yeah, just magnificent. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2458.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is a good one. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2460.8s)]
*  Overreaction Monday. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2462.8s)]
*  It's just percolating that whole day of the first first games back. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2464.8s)]
*  Everyone's just ready to go nuts. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2468.8s)]
*  Great ones off. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2471.8s)]
*  Oh, the Eagles could lose by one point like I don't know. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2472.8s)]
*  They probably peaked last year in the Super Bowl weren't ready. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2477.8s)]
*  Just great. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2479.8s)]
*  I'm proudest of myself for the NFL draft because I watch maybe one or two college football games a week if that and have no idea what I'm talking about. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2481.8s)]
*  But then I read all the mock drafts and I watch YouTube clips and then decide I'm an expert. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2489.8s)]
*  Who do you want the Patriots to take? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2495.8s)]
*  Because I've convinced myself I'm happy with four guys. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2499.8s)]
*  Four guys? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2503.8s)]
*  So I'm at Hunter. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2505.8s)]
*  Yeah, Travis Hunter, Abdul Carter, trade down. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2507.8s)]
*  Those are my three options. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2510.8s)]
*  I'm happy with Will Campbell and I'm happy with I don't really want TMAC. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2512.8s)]
*  But I kind of if we go offensive, I'm okay with that. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2517.8s)]
*  I mean, TMAC now this is one of the draft takes that's emerged is are we sure he's the best receiver in the draft? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2520.8s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2527.8s)]
*  Matthew Golden buzz. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2528.8s)]
*  McShea is pro Matthew Golden on the newsletter and the podcast he's doing. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2530.8s)]
*  He has Golden as the best receiver. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2534.8s)]
*  It's really fun when you have quarterbacks because it seems like Canmore is definitely going to Tennessee. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2536.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2541.8s)]
*  But when you have this quarterback situation with the two teams that desperately need a quarterback, Cleveland and the Giants, but then nobody really seems to think Shadr or Sanders is a top eight pick. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2542.8s)]
*  And just how desperate it is. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2553.8s)]
*  It's the age old philosophy. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2555.8s)]
*  Something's changed. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2556.8s)]
*  Sports changes. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2557.8s)]
*  Basketball. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2558.8s)]
*  We're shooting more threes than ever. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2559.8s)]
*  Baseball. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2561.8s)]
*  We get a torpedo bat. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2562.8s)]
*  You know, everything evolves in every sport. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2563.8s)]
*  And then in football, should we take this quarterback this high, even though we're not positive he's a good prospect is like the eternal question forever. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2565.8s)]
*  I'm almost positive Shadr is good. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2574.8s)]
*  I think Shadr if both teams pass on Shadr and he has the Shadr slide, I think that would be insane. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2576.8s)]
*  If he ends up on the Steelers, I think it'd be great for the Steelers. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2585.8s)]
*  But the Giants cannot pass on them. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2588.8s)]
*  That would be bonkers. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2590.8s)]
*  Well, the one thing that happens is if the first couple teams pass and the guy falls out of the range, sometimes then the guy almost has a little bit of a stink on him. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2592.8s)]
*  And then the fall starts and it's like, and then I mean Rogers is the most famous example of this, but this has happened in other years where it's like, oh, all of a sudden the guy's going to go to 17. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2602.8s)]
*  I don't have it in front of me. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2611.8s)]
*  But then after the Giants, there's a run of teams that don't need quarter starting with us. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2612.8s)]
*  We don't need a quarterback. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2617.8s)]
*  There's a run of teams. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2618.8s)]
*  And I guess you get to now with Gino's deal, the Raiders are out. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2619.8s)]
*  Then it's the Saints. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2623.8s)]
*  Well, you could say the Jets, but then they just paid all this money to Fields. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2624.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2628.8s)]
*  Yeah, the Jets would be interesting. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2629.8s)]
*  I can't imagine he'd go by the Saints because the Saints are so handicapped by the cap that I don't understand how they would not pass up a chance to get somebody. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2631.8s)]
*  But you'd have to really think he's going to be not good. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2640.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2642.8s)]
*  You know. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2643.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2644.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2645.8s)]
*  You read like pocket presence, tough as nails. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2646.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2651.8s)]
*  Read stuff fast. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2652.8s)]
*  He's been in the spotlight for a few years. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2653.8s)]
*  There's all this intangible stuff with him. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2655.8s)]
*  Then other people are like, he's just not a good enough quarterback. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2657.8s)]
*  So yeah, the drafts fun. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2659.8s)]
*  You get to argue about arm length, basketball. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2661.8s)]
*  We're talking about a playoff picture that just changes every day. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2663.8s)]
*  It's ridiculous where you're like coming up is good. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2666.8s)]
*  What happens if Denver plays the Lakers? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2670.8s)]
*  It's like they just might never play the Lakers. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2672.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2674.8s)]
*  Coming up. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2675.8s)]
*  Are the Rockets the second best team in the West, which they are, or they just a first round fodder. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2676.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2680.8s)]
*  Ready to go home. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2681.8s)]
*  Hey, should the other Grizzlies dangerous playoff team or should they blow the team up? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2682.8s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2687.8s)]
*  Never know. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2689.8s)]
*  I was thinking with LeBron. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2690.8s)]
*  If anyone's generated more takes than him and it has to be Will Chamberlain has to be the answer. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2692.8s)]
*  But I don't think the take infrastructure was in place at that point. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2698.8s)]
*  Great. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2702.8s)]
*  The take infrastructure is so good. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2703.8s)]
*  The take infrastructure was not there. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2705.8s)]
*  We just had newspapers and we had like local networks and some magazines like Sport and Sports Illustrated. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2707.8s)]
*  And then just people arguing in bars. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2715.8s)]
*  But I still feel like he's the most polarizing NBA star of all time. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2717.8s)]
*  He's still polarizing now. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2721.8s)]
*  Wilt? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2723.8s)]
*  You think Wilt or LeBron? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2724.8s)]
*  I think Wilt. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2726.8s)]
*  I think it's a hundred percent Wilt. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2727.8s)]
*  Do you count the take infrastructure? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2729.8s)]
*  If two guys are arguing in a bar, it's a little bit if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2732.8s)]
*  Does anyone hear the take? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2738.8s)]
*  Does the take still count? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2740.8s)]
*  Or does it have to be recorded on someone's podcast that you know, a lightly listened to podcast that two buddies are doing from a local bar? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2742.8s)]
*  That counts for the two guys in the 60s take doesn't count? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2751.8s)]
*  Well, what's crazy about the 60s? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2755.8s)]
*  And this is how I ended up deciding to write a Chamberlain Russell chapter when I did my book. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2757.8s)]
*  When I was doing all the research, so many people weighed in on Wilt and it was players. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2762.8s)]
*  It was stuff that never happens now. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2766.8s)]
*  Like long paragraphs from like Bill Bradley saying, here's why Wilt's a loser. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2768.8s)]
*  Just laying out like in the book that he wrote. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2773.8s)]
*  And you're just like, holy shit. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2776.8s)]
*  Like people could just never decide who this guy was, whether he won or went. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2778.8s)]
*  Even Russell was pretty critical of him. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2782.8s)]
*  I'm ready for the the Wilt the Wilt Renaissance. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2785.8s)]
*  It's already happening. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2790.8s)]
*  You think so? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2792.8s)]
*  They has a he has a lightly managed YouTube presence where every once in a while the algorithm will serve me up. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2793.8s)]
*  Like, here's Wilt blocking one from the top of the backboard. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2801.8s)]
*  What? Here's Wilt jumping over a guy. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2805.8s)]
*  Here's Wilt hitting a four hook shot corner threes for fun. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2808.8s)]
*  Like, oh, I'm ready for the take of you know, was the best player actually of all time. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2813.8s)]
*  It was Wilt. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2818.8s)]
*  That's that's going to come back because we're in the so and so was a problem era of social media where it's this is how I was thinking about Wilt last week. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2820.8s)]
*  Because one of those accounts fed me Game six bucks Lakers 1972 bucks are defending champs. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2828.8s)]
*  They have Kareem Kareem's like just killing everybody. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2836.8s)]
*  Will in the seven in the last game. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2839.8s)]
*  Is it the blocks he he's blocking Kareem Skyhook. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2841.8s)]
*  This was fed to me. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2845.8s)]
*  Yeah, this was fed to me. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2846.8s)]
*  It was riveting. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2848.8s)]
*  I saw one position. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2849.8s)]
*  It was riveting. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2850.8s)]
*  Yeah, I watched it. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2851.8s)]
*  I was like, oh, and then it was like Wilt had 22 points, 24 rebounds and 10 blocks. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2852.8s)]
*  I was like, he did. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2857.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2858.8s)]
*  Why are we being fed the same stuff? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2859.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2861.8s)]
*  So it was the for you. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2862.8s)]
*  It's a for you tab. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2864.8s)]
*  They know we like basketball. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2865.8s)]
*  So this sent me on some deep dive rabbit hole. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2866.8s)]
*  I went to basketball reference when I did my book. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2869.8s)]
*  They didn't have the box scores passed like 1986. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2871.8s)]
*  So into basketball reference. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2874.8s)]
*  And I was like, I got to find out more about this series. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2876.8s)]
*  It was Oscar Robertson and Kareem on one side and West and Will Chamberlain on the other. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2879.8s)]
*  So it's for the best 12 players ever in a series. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2883.8s)]
*  That seems like a big deal. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2886.8s)]
*  The Lakers won 33 games that year. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2887.8s)]
*  Milwaukee had won the title the year before. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2890.8s)]
*  Kareem's killing everybody. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2892.8s)]
*  So I went and looked at the stats and it made me even more confused. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2893.8s)]
*  Wilt shooting like three times a game, four times a game, like for real. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2897.8s)]
*  You can go in the box scores even in this last game when he was awesome. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2901.8s)]
*  He was like seven for 10. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2905.8s)]
*  It was like, why did Wilt stop shooting? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2906.8s)]
*  He scored a hundred points in a game. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2909.8s)]
*  That's odd. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2911.8s)]
*  Why did he just turn into a rebound block shot guy? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2912.8s)]
*  And then Kareem was like 35 and 20 the entire series. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2914.8s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2917.8s)]
*  1972. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2918.8s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2919.8s)]
*  So the 70. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2920.8s)]
*  The set. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2921.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2922.8s)]
*  The 71, 72 Lakers. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2923.8s)]
*  We just did a thing about the Thunder. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2925.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2927.8s)]
*  How good they are. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2928.8s)]
*  Winning percentage. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2929.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2930.8s)]
*  And it was the Warriors team, obviously. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2931.8s)]
*  Then it was Jordan Bulls. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2935.8s)]
*  Thunder in the middle. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2937.8s)]
*  Then that Lakers squad was like Jerry West was on it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2939.8s)]
*  And then I guess Elgin had a cup of coffee. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2943.8s)]
*  I was looking at the thing. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2945.8s)]
*  Got hurt. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2946.8s)]
*  You were tired. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2947.8s)]
*  And who else was there? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2948.8s)]
*  The guy that no one talks about. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2949.8s)]
*  Gail Goodrich. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2951.8s)]
*  Gail Goodrich. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2952.8s)]
*  I'm a blank slate when it comes to Gail Goodrich. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2953.8s)]
*  But Gail Goodrich averaged like 26 points in the playoffs. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2956.8s)]
*  Well, I read every Sports Illustrated story about it. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2959.8s)]
*  And it was 2-2 after four games. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2962.8s)]
*  And then the Lakers won the last two. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2964.8s)]
*  And one of the keys to the series was Jim McMillan, who struggled with weight during the first part of his career. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2966.8s)]
*  His teammates called him Pudgeball. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2972.8s)]
*  But then he lit it up in the series. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2974.8s)]
*  And I was like, imagine this now. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2976.8s)]
*  This would be like two days of Jim McMillan. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2979.8s)]
*  Jim McMillan's arguments. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2982.8s)]
*  I was doing head and head of... [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2984.8s)]
*  Jim got rid of the donuts and he's aimed to play. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2986.8s)]
*  But the league back then, like they just, you know, it was a pretty... [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2989.8s)]
*  It was doing okay. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2994.8s)]
*  But you have this series that really, if it happened now, would be this incredible series. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=2996.8s)]
*  Where you have like some of the greatest players of all time battling like real stakes back to back versus a 33 game winning streak. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3000.8s)]
*  I didn't know anything about it. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3006.8s)]
*  So yeah, Wilt. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3008.8s)]
*  I have no idea why he stopped shooting. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3009.8s)]
*  I would watch like a 15 episode Will Chamberlain if it was done correctly. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3011.8s)]
*  Start working on it. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3016.8s)]
*  Because then he did... [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3017.8s)]
*  Then he did... [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3019.8s)]
*  He just quit and started playing volleyball. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3021.8s)]
*  Like he had that whole stretch. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3023.8s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3025.8s)]
*  Was he playing professional volleyball? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3026.8s)]
*  Yeah, played professional volleyball. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3028.8s)]
*  Could you imagine lining up like... [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3031.8s)]
*  Seeing Wilt Chamberlain come in for the first day. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3033.8s)]
*  The first day where it's like, you know, there's no social media. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3036.8s)]
*  You don't even know who's going to show up. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3039.8s)]
*  And all of a sudden it's like, is that Wilt Chamberlain? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3041.8s)]
*  Right. That is him, right? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3044.8s)]
*  That's Wilt Chamberlain, right? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3046.8s)]
*  Yeah. There was another thing that got fed to me with... [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3048.8s)]
*  It was Wilt Chamberlain when he was 16 playing with pros. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3051.8s)]
*  And he's the same Wilt Chamberlain body, but he's super skinny. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3055.8s)]
*  And just like completely dominating everybody. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3059.8s)]
*  I think Wilt's underrated as a Twitter. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3062.8s)]
*  Because sometimes Young Shaq will have a moment on social media too. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3065.8s)]
*  Where he's just like going full court and dunking over guys. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3068.8s)]
*  And they're like, oh Jesus. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3071.8s)]
*  You know what the Young Shaq moment that gets a lot of play on social media? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3073.8s)]
*  All-star warm-ups. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3077.8s)]
*  Is Jordan guarding him, I think? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3079.8s)]
*  It's just they're like joking around. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3081.8s)]
*  And he has like some sort of crossover. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3084.8s)]
*  He looks like Stan Van Gundy. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3087.8s)]
*  Like a crossover spin layup on Jordan. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3089.8s)]
*  Like, yep, that will work. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3091.8s)]
*  Like yes, Young Shaq. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3093.8s)]
*  Yeah, because I'll go to Twitter. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3095.8s)]
*  And now it defaults to the For You page. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3097.8s)]
*  But the For You page is getting better. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3099.8s)]
*  And it's just serving me basketball now, constantly. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3101.8s)]
*  So like the other day I went on and it was Kobe against Rip Hamilton. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3104.8s)]
*  In a 1996 McDonald's All-America practice. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3109.8s)]
*  And I was like watch Kobe light up Rip Hamilton. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3113.8s)]
*  I'm like absolutely. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3116.8s)]
*  How many minutes is this? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3118.8s)]
*  Can I watch this? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3120.8s)]
*  This is great. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3122.8s)]
*  This is great content. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3123.8s)]
*  Shout out to the algorithm. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3125.8s)]
*  The algorithm is starting to work. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3126.8s)]
*  Yeah, Instagram is definitely a little gameier with the stuff they push. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3128.8s)]
*  It's a little seedier. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3133.8s)]
*  It's like two in the morning kind of wandering around New York City kind of seedy. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3135.8s)]
*  Twitter, they'll push you mostly to sports and then something horrible that you don't have any interest in. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3140.8s)]
*  Like some sort of hardcore political or whatever. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3147.8s)]
*  But I like the basketball stuff. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3149.8s)]
*  What sports story line right now are you the most fascinated in? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3151.8s)]
*  What is it? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3156.8s)]
*  Is it NBA related? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3157.8s)]
*  Well, I'm a little bit obsessed with Will Campbell's arm length. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3159.8s)]
*  But I'm going to put that aside. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3164.8s)]
*  That weight probably crested for me. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3166.8s)]
*  How about that there were two different measurements? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3168.8s)]
*  One was 32 and a half and then the other was 33 and he's like I'm actually a 33. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3170.8s)]
*  Yeah, and his wingspan got... [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3174.8s)]
*  The longer his arms got, the shorter his wingspan got. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3176.8s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't get that. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3180.8s)]
*  It's just absurd. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3181.8s)]
*  I talked to Jeff Schwartz about it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3182.8s)]
*  He's like it's nothing. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3183.8s)]
*  He'll just be able to go like that and he'll be fine. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3184.8s)]
*  I guess it's... [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3187.8s)]
*  I guess it's the... [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3189.8s)]
*  It's not... [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3190.8s)]
*  I want to be positive. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3191.8s)]
*  I guess the number one story, it's not super like out of the box, is can the Luca LeBron experiment, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3193.8s)]
*  if you want to call it that, gel fast enough to get a championship? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3202.8s)]
*  I still think that's the number one story. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3209.8s)]
*  Yeah, and there's no answer so you could just talk about it in circles forever and nobody [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3211.8s)]
*  knows until we see the playoff. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3214.8s)]
*  The fact that they were the number one defense for a good stretch, how did that happen? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3216.8s)]
*  Was that just a string of luck and hustle? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3221.8s)]
*  And is that going to come down? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3225.8s)]
*  And then I guess the other thing that we're trying to figure out is the thing about the [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3228.8s)]
*  thunder that I just mentioned and if they are truly like on paper, a historic team, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3233.8s)]
*  if they don't win, did they underachieve? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3241.8s)]
*  No one seems to be saying like, yeah, they don't win the finals, they underachieved. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3246.8s)]
*  That's the 2016 Warriors, right? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3250.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3252.8s)]
*  Yeah, but they ran into a... [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3253.8s)]
*  They lost because they ran into a legendary performer. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3255.8s)]
*  So are they going to... [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3258.8s)]
*  That's not what they lost. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3259.8s)]
*  They lost because they suspended Draymond for game five. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3262.8s)]
*  No, that's fair. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3265.8s)]
*  It's a tough suspension. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3268.8s)]
*  It's funny because Adam Sover has been in the circles recently because there's this [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3270.8s)]
*  growing conspiracy thing that I don't know how this would be true, but it's been a fun [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3276.8s)]
*  one to monitor that the league pushed for the Luka trade to the Lakers. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3281.8s)]
*  I mean... [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3286.8s)]
*  It's a great one though. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3287.8s)]
*  It's turning into this generation's version of the frozen envelope with the Ewing lottery. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3288.8s)]
*  I just can't... [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3293.8s)]
*  It's because there's no other explanation for the trade. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3294.8s)]
*  So now the conspiracy people have nudged that way to that one. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3297.8s)]
*  I can't wait to get aggregated incorrectly for it. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3302.8s)]
*  Did the conspiracy community already move off of they were trying to purposely sour [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3304.8s)]
*  the fan base to move the team to Las Vegas? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3311.8s)]
*  I thought that was the first conspiracy out of the box. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3314.8s)]
*  Listen, did I hop on that tricycle and take it around for a little spin in my living [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3317.8s)]
*  room? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3322.8s)]
*  I did. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3323.8s)]
*  I did. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3324.8s)]
*  I tested it out. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3325.8s)]
*  It's pretty ludicrous. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3326.8s)]
*  I like the league brokering a trade. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3327.8s)]
*  It's pretty funny, especially because they killed the Chris Paul trade to the Lakers [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3331.8s)]
*  15 years ago. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3336.8s)]
*  So it's... [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3337.8s)]
*  No conspiracies, mate. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3338.8s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3339.8s)]
*  When there's no explanation for something, that's when conspiracies start. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3340.8s)]
*  When it's just like, this is the dumbest trade ever. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3342.8s)]
*  There has to be a reason this happened. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3344.8s)]
*  And none of the reasons fit. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3346.8s)]
*  That's when you have conspiracies. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3347.8s)]
*  Just bad call. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3350.8s)]
*  Just bad decision. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3351.8s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3352.8s)]
*  I was going to do a thing on... [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3353.8s)]
*  It took me a long time because everybody had their own look-a-take. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3354.8s)]
*  And I'm like, what's my angle on this? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3365.8s)]
*  It's such a bad decision. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3367.8s)]
*  And I came up with it. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3368.8s)]
*  It's a little story. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3369.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3370.8s)]
*  One day, I was working on... [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3372.8s)]
*  We were doing commercial maintenance and painting and stuff. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3375.8s)]
*  We take care of parking lots and stuff. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3378.8s)]
*  And my boss got a job power washing. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3380.8s)]
*  We were power washing, ironically, a car wash, the outside of a car wash. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3386.8s)]
*  And the first day I went, I had sneakers on and socks. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3391.8s)]
*  And they're getting soaked. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3394.8s)]
*  It's a real... [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3396.8s)]
*  It's not even a power wash. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3397.8s)]
*  We were stripping the cinder block with this high-powered pressure washer. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3398.8s)]
*  And I had socks on and wet shoes. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3402.8s)]
*  And it was the worst. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3405.8s)]
*  I'm stomping around. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3407.8s)]
*  I had trench foot. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3409.8s)]
*  Next day, I said, I can't do this again. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3411.8s)]
*  I'm going to wear sandals because we're going to do a two-day project. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3413.8s)]
*  Next day, I wear sandals. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3416.8s)]
*  Pressure washing, pressure washing. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3418.8s)]
*  The only thing worse than having trench foot is having all these little paint chips get [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3420.8s)]
*  in between my toes and I'm stepping and they're sharp. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3425.8s)]
*  And it's bothering me and annoying me so much. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3428.8s)]
*  I have this pressure washer and I look down at my foot. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3431.8s)]
*  I said, ooh, this would feel so good if I take this pressure washer. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3434.8s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3439.8s)]
*  And I just looked at it and I just did it. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3440.8s)]
*  And there was no conspiracy to it. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3445.8s)]
*  There was no like maybe Wilds wanted to get off of work and maybe he was upset with the job. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3449.8s)]
*  And maybe he wanted to go back and work on a different project. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3454.8s)]
*  No. You know what it was? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3459.8s)]
*  Just an absolutely horrible decision on my part to blast my own foot and some skin off. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3460.8s)]
*  Oh, you like some skin off? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3467.8s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3469.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3470.8s)]
*  It's a blast in my own foot. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3471.8s)]
*  That is the Luca trade. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3473.8s)]
*  There's it's just a really bad decision that I think immediately you recognize. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3475.8s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3481.8s)]
*  Bad call on my skin's hanging off. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3482.8s)]
*  Nico Harrison's body, right? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3485.8s)]
*  Is the trades being called in? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3487.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3489.8s)]
*  I didn't realize that I did realize that I think about if I could go back, I would I would not do that again. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3490.8s)]
*  That was the only only idea. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3497.8s)]
*  The only move for him is just to resign because at some point you only have one life. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3500.8s)]
*  We think. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3507.8s)]
*  And if your life just for the next two years is you've you've committed this reviled transaction and the whole point of like being a GM or whatever for a team other than running the team, picking the players. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3508.8s)]
*  But you also want to go to the games and be like, yeah, that's my team. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3519.8s)]
*  And now that's been I just don't understand what the win is for him at this point. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3524.8s)]
*  No, he's pot committed. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3528.8s)]
*  He's he's all this. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3530.8s)]
*  He has to be all in. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3531.8s)]
*  You can't resign. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3533.8s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you get Cooper flag and someone else is like, man, we did it. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3534.8s)]
*  So wait until after the draft. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3540.8s)]
*  Make sure you get you have to be like you have to come out with some messaging like, look, defense wins championships. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3542.8s)]
*  I'll never waver from that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3550.8s)]
*  I'm a result. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3551.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3552.8s)]
*  Tell me I'm wrong. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3553.8s)]
*  Like, when this next time this franchise wins a championship, it will be because of defense. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3555.8s)]
*  Anthony Davis. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3561.8s)]
*  This is good. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3562.8s)]
*  So the best case scenario for him is the Lakers suck in the playoffs. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3563.8s)]
*  They underachieve in some way or it doesn't work out. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3568.8s)]
*  And there's more questions about Luca, even though there shouldn't be questions. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3571.8s)]
*  But a little like after the finals last year, like he wasn't that good in the finals. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3574.8s)]
*  And the Celtics really attacked him on defense. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3579.8s)]
*  Yeah, like, oh, we're down a little bit. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3581.8s)]
*  Maybe maybe this could be a James Harden of this generation kind of guy. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3583.8s)]
*  You'd have that and then you would have whoever wins the title. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3587.8s)]
*  It's like, man, like, OK, see, wins the title. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3591.8s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3593.8s)]
*  Their defense. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3594.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3595.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3596.8s)]
*  Defense wins championships. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3597.8s)]
*  Then Nico's like, see what I mean? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3598.8s)]
*  I'm trying to tell you guys. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3599.8s)]
*  We're just, you know, a little bit unlucky with Kyrie. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3600.8s)]
*  One draft pick. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3604.8s)]
*  He can't he can't move. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3607.8s)]
*  He has to he has to give it a shot. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3608.8s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3611.8s)]
*  I have a I have probably a hot take off the trade. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3612.8s)]
*  If they had gotten Reeves in it with how good Reeves is. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3615.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3619.8s)]
*  And it was Reeves and Anthony Davis and two firsts like we're in the ballpark of like I can now I can start to see it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3620.8s)]
*  You can at least talk me into it after two drinks. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3628.8s)]
*  That's the other part of it. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3630.8s)]
*  That's bad. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3632.8s)]
*  It was just also trading. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3633.8s)]
*  I can't talk about this. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3635.8s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3636.8s)]
*  On its face is bad. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3637.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3638.8s)]
*  But then you still didn't get enough. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3639.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's not getting enough is the is to me. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3641.8s)]
*  If we're doing a seesaw, it's 70 percent you didn't get enough. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3644.8s)]
*  And then 30 percent. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3648.8s)]
*  I can't believe you traded Luka Doncic. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3650.8s)]
*  But it's still the 70 percent of you just didn't get enough. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3651.8s)]
*  Mikhail Bridges got was it five first round picks? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3654.8s)]
*  Yeah, two of them are kind of. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3658.8s)]
*  But yeah, it's still Davis is Davis is like a top 12 guy, but he's a little injury prone. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3660.8s)]
*  But yeah, it's I don't know what you do because you've you've hurt the sport in a city in a way that we've kind of time out. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3667.8s)]
*  Never never seen it. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3675.8s)]
*  Just a bookmark. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3677.8s)]
*  It just did not to book it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3678.8s)]
*  Just a book and conspiracy bill didn't hurt the sport. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3679.8s)]
*  Did not hurt. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3683.8s)]
*  Well, that's what I mean. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3684.8s)]
*  It's really important in one city, but it helped in the other cities. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3685.8s)]
*  Yeah, it really helped the sport. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3689.8s)]
*  The idea I'm not going to really help the sport, but did hurt the team. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3693.8s)]
*  Also, not ruling out Anthony Davis. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3697.8s)]
*  Pelicans Anthony Davis, can he come back? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3700.8s)]
*  And Anthony Davis, like when we were having real conversations like his PR numbers are Wilt Chamberlain s. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3703.8s)]
*  It's like remember that it was I don't know how long ago that was, but he was having those killer seasons and then kind of flame out in the playoffs. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3711.8s)]
*  But man, I don't know. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3718.8s)]
*  I kind of believe in Anthony Davis. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3719.8s)]
*  I have an announcement for you. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3721.8s)]
*  I have an announcement. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3723.8s)]
*  They traded Mookie Betts, I think February 2020. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3727.8s)]
*  It's like a couple weeks for COVID. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3731.8s)]
*  I saw this tweet. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3733.8s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3734.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to do the tweet, but then I'm going to dive into a little more. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3735.8s)]
*  Love it. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3738.8s)]
*  The Red Sox were never the same for me after that trade. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3739.8s)]
*  They'd won four titles. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3742.8s)]
*  Baseball was changing. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3744.8s)]
*  My basketball, football fascinations were growing every year. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3746.8s)]
*  All these different reasons for it. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3750.8s)]
*  It just was not life and death for me like it used to be, but it was really about the trade and not having. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3752.8s)]
*  Was that the beginning of the end or the final straw that broke the camel's back? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3757.8s)]
*  I think it was like five straws that broke the camel's back because I love Mookie Betts. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3766.8s)]
*  The whole point of sports is to want Tom Brady for 20 years. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3772.8s)]
*  You want Jason Tatum for 20 years. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3776.8s)]
*  You get one of these guys. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3778.8s)]
*  It's like Dallas with Mookie. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3780.8s)]
*  You get one of these guys. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3781.8s)]
*  This is like one fourth or one fifth of your life potentially that you're disguised on your team. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3782.8s)]
*  Mookie was like everything I wanted from a good player. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3788.8s)]
*  They trade them. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3791.8s)]
*  I'm never the same. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3792.8s)]
*  It really made me. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3793.8s)]
*  But now with this with the Red Sox, with Christian Campbell and with Roman Anthony Gummink and hopefully Mayor, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3795.8s)]
*  but especially how much fun it's been to watch Christian Campbell these first few games. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3801.8s)]
*  And it's very similar to Mookie's rookie season where he just like he's swinging from the heels on everything, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3806.8s)]
*  but his bats hitting everything and you just you don't want to miss is that bats the way he cares himself. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3812.8s)]
*  He had this thing the other day. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3818.8s)]
*  The other day, Cora talked about where he said he doesn't call his teammates teammates. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3819.8s)]
*  Did you hear this? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3825.8s)]
*  No, he doesn't say teammate. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3826.8s)]
*  He says friend. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3828.8s)]
*  Love it. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3829.8s)]
*  He's like, these are my friends. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3830.8s)]
*  My friend Raphael Devers. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3832.8s)]
*  He doesn't use the word teammate. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3833.8s)]
*  I was like, this guy's at a central castings 22. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3835.8s)]
*  He's the most exciting rookie they've had since Mookie Betts. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3838.8s)]
*  But then Roman Anthony, who's coming at some point this year, who's the best prospect in baseball. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3842.8s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3847.8s)]
*  I'm like I was on the Castaway Island with Tom Hanks. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3848.8s)]
*  You're back. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3851.8s)]
*  Yeah, I was, you know, I was doing some spearfishing. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3852.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3855.8s)]
*  Sleeping in a cave talking to a volleyball, but I think I'm back. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3856.8s)]
*  OK, welcome back. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3859.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3860.8s)]
*  I you guys start following the woo socks. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3861.8s)]
*  That's where I'm getting my like my Roman Anthony. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3864.8s)]
*  Roman Anthony. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3867.8s)]
*  Roman Anthony. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3868.8s)]
*  I'm like, oh, another home run. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3869.8s)]
*  I'm just seeing highlights. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3870.8s)]
*  I never see the guys strike out or ground out. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3871.8s)]
*  Everything looks great. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3873.8s)]
*  Well, this is the only sport where when somebody's playing, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3874.8s)]
*  when somebody's just an awesome prospect, it makes the most sense in baseball. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3877.8s)]
*  When you just see somebody, you're like, that guy's fucking awesome. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3882.8s)]
*  I guess that can happen in basketball, too, but not in the same way because they're a little younger and they're competing against like grown ass men in baseball. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3886.8s)]
*  Sometimes you have these dudes come in, you're like, wow, you see some of the Roman Anthony highlights. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3892.8s)]
*  You're like, wow. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3898.8s)]
*  Are you worried about Devers on the flip side? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3899.8s)]
*  My dad is some big conversation with my dad. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3902.8s)]
*  You got a hit. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3905.8s)]
*  He came in fat in camp. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3906.8s)]
*  It's his fault. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3908.8s)]
*  He was like, offset about it. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3909.8s)]
*  I like it. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3910.8s)]
*  I like all the stories. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3911.8s)]
*  It's like it's one part injury. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3912.8s)]
*  It's one part certain amount of that bats. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3914.8s)]
*  It's one party opened up his batting stance. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3916.8s)]
*  And then I forgot. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3918.8s)]
*  Was it Papelbon said it now? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3919.8s)]
*  Too many carbs. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3921.8s)]
*  Oh, too many carbs would actually be the best thing. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3922.8s)]
*  I think baseball has become the new David Stern NBA where every first month of the season, they have some sort of controversy now. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3926.8s)]
*  Like this year's torpedo bats. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3934.8s)]
*  I was all in. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3936.8s)]
*  I read every torpedo bat thing. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3937.8s)]
*  I've been watching the Yankees clips of them. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3938.8s)]
*  I was like, wow, this is why. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3941.8s)]
*  Why is this legal? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3943.8s)]
*  How are they doing this? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3944.8s)]
*  Why don't other things like it's really fascinating? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3945.8s)]
*  Loved it. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3947.8s)]
*  I'm surprised that I didn't even know that we didn't. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3948.8s)]
*  I didn't know that was a thing considering like if you have a kid in Little League and there's new bats coming out every three months. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3951.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3958.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's like it's a iPhone updates like new bat. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3959.8s)]
*  This bat's no good anymore. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3963.8s)]
*  This bat is hotter. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3965.8s)]
*  Oh, you need this bat. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3966.8s)]
*  This bat's out of hits. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3967.8s)]
*  We have to get a different bat. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3969.8s)]
*  There's three different about like the bat technology and youth baseball is out of control. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3971.8s)]
*  So it's about time it caught up with Major League Baseball. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3974.8s)]
*  You kind of graduated out of baseball bat parenting. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3977.8s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3981.8s)]
*  I look I look back at some of the kids sports that I had to sit through. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3982.8s)]
*  And baseball is way up there is the worst. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3988.8s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3990.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3991.8s)]
*  Like what was he any good? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3992.8s)]
*  No, no, it wasn't about whether he was actually good. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3994.8s)]
*  And I think that COVID thing kind of ended the baseball. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=3998.8s)]
*  But it was just it's it's the seeding like the worst possible seeding situations, the long drives everywhere, the games. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4000.8s)]
*  Nobody has control over the pitches over the mound. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4011.8s)]
*  The ball's going everywhere. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4015.8s)]
*  Kids are crying. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4017.8s)]
*  Like if you go 10, that sweet spot with the boys between 8 and 11, anyone's a candidate start crying during the game. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4018.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4024.8s)]
*  Everyone's like it's just a roller coaster ride. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4025.8s)]
*  But the sports I missed, thank God, gymnastics. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4027.8s)]
*  That sounds horrific. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4032.8s)]
*  Swimming sounds awful. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4034.8s)]
*  Just from the parent standpoint. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4036.8s)]
*  And then track and field. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4038.8s)]
*  Those are the big three of the ones you don't want your kid to do. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4039.8s)]
*  Baseball. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4041.8s)]
*  I'm a baseball guy. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4042.8s)]
*  I like being a baseball. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4044.8s)]
*  Good to be outside at least. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4045.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4046.8s)]
*  Well, the other thing is, I think you're a little spoiled in Southern California, which is right. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4047.8s)]
*  We can't appreciate it. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4053.8s)]
*  I also just like sitting outside for two hours. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4054.8s)]
*  I won't do it in my backyard, but I'm happy to just sit outside in the sunshine like, oh, this is delightful. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4058.8s)]
*  Also, nowhere to hide in baseball, which is nice. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4065.8s)]
*  Play a lot of sports like soccer. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4068.8s)]
*  Hey, how's the soccer game go? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4071.8s)]
*  Oh, it's this person did this and this person like, no, dude, like you're at that. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4073.8s)]
*  You have to hit the ball. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4077.8s)]
*  You know, it was part of the baseball thing for me. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4079.8s)]
*  I thought the parents were especially annoying. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4081.8s)]
*  It's a tough parent crowd, but the guy who has to go right behind on plate videotape all his kids pitches and he's blocking everybody. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4083.8s)]
*  And then the two parents who get a little chirpy with kids on the other team, you're like, dude, these kids are 10. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4091.8s)]

*  I don't like to hear. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4145.8s)]
*  It's funny you mention this because when Ben was playing third base, I would sit in left field and I really enjoyed it because nobody was out there. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4146.8s)]
*  I was still close enough to see what was going on with him. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4153.8s)]

*  Call the wolf. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4468.8s)]
*  Here's what else I feel like that can't be the only job for the for the animal wolf. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4472.8s)]
*  It's got to be there's got to be a couple other things like bit by a rattlesnake. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4478.8s)]
*  He knows what to do with that. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4481.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he can do all. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4482.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's got like five specialties. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4483.8s)]
*  Yes, that's sure. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4485.8s)]
*  But I really enjoy I would just like to call him. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4487.8s)]
*  Take care of the skunk smell. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4490.8s)]
*  But also, if you also coincidentally got bit by a rattlesnake, that would also work. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4492.8s)]
*  So then that goes into it. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4498.8s)]
*  So that's just a kind of that's a one that happened last night. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4499.8s)]
*  Here's the real one that I actually thought of tough one for the dog, man. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4501.8s)]
*  This getting sprayed close by a skunk. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4504.8s)]
*  It's a bad. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4507.8s)]
*  It's honestly a concussion. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4508.8s)]
*  He actually started to like it. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4510.8s)]
*  He liked the attention. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4512.8s)]
*  OK, it's getting court skunk. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4513.8s)]
*  OK, this one is called home odors association. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4516.8s)]
*  This is just a coincidence from the skunk thing. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4522.8s)]
*  OK, OK. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4524.8s)]
*  This is going to upend the real estate market. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4525.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4527.8s)]
*  Real estate is usually based on visuals, right? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4529.8s)]
*  Curb appeal of the home. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4535.8s)]
*  What type of view do you have? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4537.8s)]
*  You view the water view of the, you know, nice forest, perhaps. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4539.8s)]
*  And if it's so it's one part, visuals, probably the top dog. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4543.8s)]
*  Sometimes real estate is based on sounds. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4546.8s)]
*  Oh, it's a quiet neighborhood. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4548.8s)]
*  Or if you're too close to the highway, it's loud and that will hurt the value. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4550.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's never based on smells. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4554.8s)]
*  So I came home the other day. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4559.8s)]
*  Someone was having cooking up several cheeseburgers and I was like, wow, I was just walking home like this. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4561.8s)]
*  What a great spell. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4567.8s)]
*  Develop a property and maybe you got to figure out the wind patterns or, you know, you have a little pop up barbecue places. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4568.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4574.8s)]
*  And they don't have to make money because the money is within the smell. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4575.8s)]
*  So it's like a grilling a cheeseburger smell just a lot of the time. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4578.8s)]
*  A bakery. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4583.8s)]
*  We have a bakery in in Portchester. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4584.8s)]
*  There's a bakery. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4586.8s)]
*  It smells wonderful. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4587.8s)]
*  Ride my bike around like, wow, should I go get some fresh bread? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4589.8s)]
*  Was there another level of this where it's almost like you have a surround sound system in your house, but instead it's a surround smell system and you're like today I'm going to pass. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4593.8s)]
*  I'm going to pass out the smell of burgers being grilled and they just go through your house. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4602.8s)]
*  I love it. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4607.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4609.8s)]
*  I mean, that's just can't I come up with that? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4610.8s)]
*  I can do everything. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4612.8s)]
*  I is overrated. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4613.8s)]
*  Pizza. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4614.8s)]
*  Pizza burning on a grill. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4615.8s)]
*  I love it. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4616.8s)]
*  I love it. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4617.8s)]
*  I love it. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4618.8s)]
*  I is overrated. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4619.8s)]
*  Pizza. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4620.8s)]
*  Pizza burning on a wood grill smell. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4621.8s)]
*  Here's here's another one. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4624.8s)]
*  This is not this is not artificial. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4625.8s)]
*  I'm doing the real thing. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4627.8s)]
*  You know, not just like a fake. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4628.8s)]
*  I'm not a Yankee candle out here. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4630.8s)]
*  An old man with a pipe. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4633.8s)]
*  He comes to your house because I don't I don't want the nicotine. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4636.8s)]
*  I don't want, you know, the chance of diseases and I don't want the secondhand smoke. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4640.8s)]
*  But while you're at work, an old man with a pipe will come and sit down in a chair just for two hours. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4645.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4651.8s)]
*  And then leaves and then leaves. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4652.8s)]
*  But you go in there like, wow, smells like folk music here. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4653.8s)]
*  Smells great. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4657.8s)]
*  You made me think of L.A. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4659.8s)]
*  Live walk into where we both used to do TV and do TV shows and Grantland was there that there was that restaurant and would spew out the hot air from the air conditioning that smelled like food, like burgers and dogs. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4660.8s)]
*  But it was like this hot, humid, disgusting version of the smell. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4674.8s)]
*  And when you walk through it, you got hit by it every time and you always forget it was there. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4677.8s)]
*  You know, talk about that bad, bad smells like a cross from Suya hot heat, like kind of food that was already made. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4681.8s)]
*  Gross smell. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4690.8s)]
*  Oh, I got hit by it last week. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4691.8s)]
*  And you didn't like the garage. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4693.8s)]
*  Did not like it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4695.8s)]
*  Well, you're all of your odors sound much better. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4696.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4699.8s)]
*  It has to be positive orders. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4700.8s)]
*  That's what it's called. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4701.8s)]
*  One part Winston Wolf of skunks. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4702.8s)]
*  One part home odors association. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4705.8s)]
*  Really great. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4707.8s)]
*  Great start. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4708.8s)]
*  You want to go and have one another one? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4709.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4711.8s)]
*  Combine. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4714.8s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4715.8s)]
*  I'll start here. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4717.8s)]
*  One of the legendary pro days story. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4720.8s)]
*  Kobe's pro day where Jerry West brings in Michael Cooper. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4723.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4728.8s)]
*  And Michael Cooper was 40 years old. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4729.8s)]
*  Kobe cooked him up. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4731.8s)]
*  Jerry West realizes that Kobe is a superstar. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4732.8s)]
*  He knew it. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4736.8s)]
*  But that was a that is a legendary pro day story. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4737.8s)]
*  I'm seeing Cam Ward. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4742.8s)]
*  Nobody's there. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4744.8s)]
*  He's just throwing to no one. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4745.8s)]
*  There's no opposition. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4747.8s)]
*  Ashton Gentry. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4749.8s)]
*  We had his pro day. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4750.8s)]
*  He took a shirt off. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4751.8s)]
*  Looks great. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4752.8s)]
*  But he's running against literal garbage cans and jumping over little cones. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4753.8s)]
*  So here's the idea. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4757.8s)]
*  Remember Iron Mike Sharp? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4758.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4760.8s)]
*  That he would just come in and get beaten up and you're like, ah, it's entertaining. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4761.8s)]
*  Iron Mike Sharp. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4766.8s)]
*  You're talking about wrestling jobbers. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4768.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4770.8s)]
*  For your for your pro day. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4771.8s)]
*  Come in. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4774.8s)]
*  So football jobbers. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4775.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4776.8s)]
*  But stars like like Michael Cooper s like Aaron Donnell. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4777.8s)]
*  Look. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4782.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4783.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4784.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4785.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4786.8s)]
*  He's not working out lately. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4787.8s)]
*  Any interest in suiting up and trying to get past Will Campbell? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4788.8s)]
*  Like worst case scenario for Will Campbell, you hold your own against Aaron Donald. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4793.8s)]
*  And I know you're thinking the pushback is going to be push back to make Aaron Donald's [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4797.8s)]
*  been out of league like, oh, so what you tackled Barry Sanders. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4804.8s)]
*  He's 45. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4807.8s)]
*  I get it. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4808.8s)]
*  But. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4809.8s)]
*  But. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4810.8s)]
*  The I forget which Jake Paul, Jake Paul Tyson. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4811.8s)]
*  There is a glitch in sports fans minds. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4815.8s)]
*  And it's happening right now with Aaron Rodgers that sports fans and maybe this is because [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4821.8s)]
*  of Tom Brady's longevity and LeBron's longevity that the glitch is we cannot process. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4826.8s)]
*  Aging of our heroes, aging of superstars. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4835.8s)]
*  We just can't quite. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4839.8s)]
*  I talked about this two weeks ago. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4840.8s)]
*  Brady screwed it up in football. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4842.8s)]
*  Now we just assume Aaron Rodgers shouldn't be washed. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4843.8s)]
*  Of course he's going to be good. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4846.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4847.8s)]
*  Because Tom Brady was good. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4848.8s)]
*  We're not like, no, he was one of the only Brady and LeBron. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4849.8s)]
*  That's right. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4852.8s)]
*  They went to that made it into their forties and stayed good. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4853.8s)]
*  But if you are, you know, if you are a little bit younger than me, that was they were the [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4856.8s)]
*  main figures of your entire sports universe. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4863.8s)]
*  So, of course, the great players can go. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4867.8s)]
*  Same with Mike Tyson. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4870.8s)]
*  When I saw Mike, I'm like, oh, I don't know. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4871.8s)]
*  Mike Tyson's got a chance. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4872.8s)]
*  Even now. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4873.8s)]
*  It's like, no, Mike Tyson was pulling punches. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4874.8s)]
*  Mike Tyson is older than I. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4876.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4879.8s)]
*  Of course you can't absorb a punch. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4880.8s)]
*  So that's why. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4882.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4883.8s)]
*  Look at Travis Hunter tracking down. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4884.8s)]
*  Look at him lighting up the row. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4887.8s)]
*  Revis. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4889.8s)]
*  Be great. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4890.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4891.8s)]
*  Tacklin Barry Sanders. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4892.8s)]
*  Oh, get Calvin Johnson out there. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4893.8s)]
*  Can you lock up Calvin Johnson? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4895.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think it would be great. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4897.8s)]
*  So I also a good way for the old guys to stick around, make some money. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4899.8s)]
*  And next thing you know, like maybe you guys get enough a shot at it. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4903.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4906.8s)]
*  Yeah, like Terrell Owens trying to cook Will Johnson. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4907.8s)]
*  Yes, that would be tremendous. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4910.8s)]
*  You shut down. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4912.8s)]
*  Shut down to you. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4913.8s)]
*  That would work. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4915.8s)]
*  Do you want do you want my worst one, a decent one or one that I'm actually afraid to give [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4916.8s)]
*  out because I feel like it's an actual idea. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4921.8s)]
*  I like the one that you're afraid to give out. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4923.8s)]
*  Your worst ones are usually pretty bad. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4926.8s)]
*  OK. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4928.8s)]
*  Remember Masterclass when all the like Malcolm Gladwell teaches you how to write a book and [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4932.8s)]
*  is that still a Dave Chang? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4938.8s)]
*  I don't know if it's still a thing or not. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4939.8s)]
*  And you would watch these tutorials, but it was like they would just get all these awesome [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4941.8s)]
*  people. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4945.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4946.8s)]
*  What is the biggest question couples ask one another every week? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4947.8s)]
*  The number one thing couples who are married, who are somewhere between my age group and [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4951.8s)]
*  your age group, even though we're pretty close to each other, the number one question we [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4957.8s)]
*  ask week after week. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4962.8s)]
*  I mean, this sounds so lame, but like, what is our what is our schedule this week? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4965.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably I had that number two. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4971.8s)]
*  Number one. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4973.8s)]
*  Should we watch this? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4976.8s)]
*  It's like, hey, Netflix, we'll go check Netflix. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4977.8s)]
*  What's on there? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4980.8s)]
*  Temptation Allen. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4981.8s)]
*  Should we watch this one episode? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4984.8s)]
*  What's this new show? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4986.8s)]
*  Adolescence. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4987.8s)]
*  Celtic City on Max Sports documentary at a team. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4989.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4993.8s)]
*  Is this a good one? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4994.8s)]
*  Should we watch this? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4995.8s)]
*  This is the there's so much content. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4997.8s)]
*  It's like, oh, I'm going to watch this. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=4999.8s)]
*  I'm going to watch this. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5001.8s)]
*  I'm going to watch this. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5002.8s)]
*  I'm going to watch this. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5003.8s)]
*  I'm going to watch this. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5004.8s)]
*  There's so much content. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5005.8s)]
*  You never know what to watch, what not to watch, what's good, what's not good. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5006.8s)]
*  OK. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5010.8s)]
*  And then you end up like you're on Google. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5011.8s)]
*  You're looking out like, oh, did Vulture write a recap of this? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5013.8s)]
*  Did oh, wait, the ringer wrote a piece that said they said this was good. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5017.8s)]
*  Oh, I heard on the like there's this extra step. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5020.8s)]
*  Well, not with Master Critic. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5024.8s)]
*  OK, let's go ahead. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5026.8s)]
*  We're doing all A.I. for movies, TV, reality. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5028.8s)]
*  So reality, it's like. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5034.8s)]
*  Should I watch Temptation Island? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5036.8s)]
*  Dave Jacoby hasn't watched it either. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5038.8s)]
*  He's this are reality. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5040.8s)]
*  But we do have is A.I. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5041.8s)]
*  Dave Jacoby, who's taken all of his takes on reality ever. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5043.8s)]
*  And then take Temptation Island, the synopsis, what they've heard of the show, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5047.8s)]
*  synthesize and then you click A.I. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5052.8s)]
*  Dave Jacoby and A.I. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5055.8s)]
*  Dave Jacoby says, I think Temptation Island is going to be pretty good. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5056.8s)]
*  I was a big fan of the one in 03 and just talks to you like Dave Jacoby. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5059.8s)]
*  But it's A.I. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5063.8s)]
*  Same thing for A.I. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5064.8s)]
*  Roger Ebert. Roger Ebert is back. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5066.8s)]
*  He's reviewing movies again. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5068.8s)]
*  We're going we're calling. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5070.8s)]
*  And by the way, his estate gets a share of Master Class. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5072.8s)]
*  But we're calling 40 years of Roger Ebert reviews and A.I. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5075.8s)]
*  can figure out would he have liked the movie that's about to come out. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5079.8s)]
*  Me. There's a new heist movie. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5082.8s)]
*  A.I. Bill Simmons. I'm dead. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5084.8s)]
*  A.I. Bill Simmons. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5086.8s)]
*  You know, it's like maybe I could be alive. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5087.8s)]
*  Yeah, you don't need to be dead for this. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5090.8s)]
*  It's like, wait, it can be a time saving thing. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5091.8s)]
*  You don't need to wait. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5093.8s)]
*  So it's Chris Evans and Denzel Washington are in Argentina and they have to commit a heist. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5094.8s)]
*  And then I come in and I just say, yeah, you should watch this. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5102.8s)]
*  That's all I got. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5105.8s)]
*  Master critic. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5106.8s)]
*  All right. So this is it's all A.I. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5107.8s)]
*  This is a I hate to say because you've done this before in our history of half baked ideas. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5109.8s)]
*  You don't totally grasp the concept. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5115.8s)]
*  You think this is too fully baked. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5119.8s)]
*  That's just called a business idea that you should have saved for like some important meeting. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5121.8s)]
*  That's why I was hesitant to give it out. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5127.8s)]
*  That was that's what you call a real good idea. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5129.8s)]
*  A.I. Dave Jacoby. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5134.8s)]
*  Yeah, that that's a real. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5136.8s)]
*  What about dive bars with Kyle? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5138.8s)]
*  Like it's it's A.I. Kyle. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5140.8s)]
*  That's better. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5142.8s)]
*  Where it's just the A.I. can look at the dive bar and the sign and find out how many bars on tap and would Kyle go in there and spend four hours there? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5144.8s)]
*  See, that's I feel like master critic has has options for everybody. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5152.8s)]
*  So the A.I. can go and look at the background and figure out exactly what people like. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5157.8s)]
*  And then basically you reverse engineering like supposedly what Netflix was doing, like picking all of these characteristics. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5161.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then you're just reversing it. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5168.8s)]
*  The thing I do like that I think you stumbled upon with Roger Ebert, like sometimes there's Cisco and Ebert. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5170.8s)]
*  I will try to figure out if I want to watch something. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5178.8s)]
*  Let's read this review. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5181.8s)]
*  And it's this interesting review that the writer is writing all of these things like. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5182.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5188.8s)]
*  Here's what I like. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5190.8s)]
*  Old school. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5191.8s)]
*  Yeah. Thumbs up or thumbs down. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5192.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5194.8s)]
*  It's worth seeing or it's not. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5195.8s)]
*  That's it. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5198.8s)]
*  I don't I don't need any vagueness. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5199.8s)]
*  I'm not. Watch it. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5203.8s)]
*  Thumbs down. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5204.8s)]
*  Oh, it's rotten tomatoes. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5205.8s)]
*  You ever get like a 77 percent rotten tomatoes by the fans. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5206.8s)]
*  But the other one is 60 percent like, huh, am I supposed to what? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5210.8s)]
*  Thumbs up or thumbs down. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5215.8s)]
*  That's all I want. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5217.8s)]
*  I agree. Good. That's a real idea, though. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5219.8s)]
*  Thanks. Maybe I shouldn't give it away. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5221.8s)]
*  No, that was well, at least I got it on the record. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5223.8s)]
*  Now somebody has that now I have trademark. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5225.8s)]
*  Did I if I did this one already, Kyle edited out, but I don't think I have. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5229.8s)]
*  Did some caroling over the holidays. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5235.8s)]
*  I don't remember this one. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5238.8s)]
*  OK, good. I did some caroling. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5240.8s)]
*  Well, we haven't talked to you since the holidays, so we definitely haven't heard this. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5243.8s)]
*  This is this is fresh. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5246.8s)]
*  It'd be funny if you did do this and neither of us remembered it, though. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5250.8s)]
*  No, I do think I have one of those. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5253.8s)]
*  But yeah, I'll try. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5255.8s)]
*  This one's fresh. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5257.8s)]
*  So did some caroling exactly what you think. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5259.8s)]
*  Some strong eggnog. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5262.8s)]
*  We got some song books walking around in the freezing cold singing. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5263.8s)]
*  Loved it. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5269.8s)]
*  Loved it to the point where I stopped. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5271.8s)]
*  I said, you know what, Lib, we should carol like this should be our thing, too. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5274.8s)]
*  Maybe we go to their house to carol one week. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5279.8s)]
*  We go another week. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5281.8s)]
*  And I was upset that I was going to have to wait. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5283.8s)]
*  Three hundred and sixty five days to go caroling. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5286.8s)]
*  There's no law against. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5290.8s)]
*  Non Christmas caroling. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5293.8s)]
*  Just year round caroling. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5296.8s)]
*  Chavez day. Let's get out there. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5299.8s)]
*  Do some carols any day, any day, any day you want. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5301.8s)]
*  But it's what people talk about. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5305.8s)]
*  I don't golf, but I'm like, I don't know. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5307.8s)]
*  It's a golf like look, you're out here with your buddies. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5310.8s)]
*  It's a nice walk. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5313.8s)]
*  You're having some drinks. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5315.8s)]
*  You're spending some time together. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5316.8s)]
*  And, you know, it's a great time. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5318.8s)]
*  Just you want to call it mobile karaoke. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5322.8s)]
*  Sure. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5324.8s)]
*  Let's all get together. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5325.8s)]
*  What are we doing tonight? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5327.8s)]
*  Oh, we're going to have a few drinks. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5328.8s)]
*  And by the way, if you're singing, you're allowed to drink in public. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5329.8s)]
*  That's just a little carve out of the law. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5333.8s)]
*  I don't think like bring caroling back. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5336.8s)]
*  But I don't even know if it's caroling holiday specific or am I just a door to door? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5339.8s)]
*  I always felt it did. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5344.8s)]
*  I feel like there needs to be a specific reason for caroling. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5345.8s)]
*  Like in the holidays, it's because everybody's in cheerful mood and they're in the giving spirit. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5348.8s)]
*  But what does that mean? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5353.8s)]
*  But if I showed up on your doorstep on July 4th to sing the Star Spangled Banner, you wouldn't turn me away. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5354.8s)]
*  I got a cocktail. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5360.8s)]
*  That's why this is happening. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5362.8s)]
*  I'd probably be like, why is that guy at our door? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5365.8s)]
*  Lots of friends. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5368.8s)]
*  I give you a Budweiser. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5369.8s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5371.8s)]
*  We're just going down. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5372.8s)]
*  We're just singing patriotic songs. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5373.8s)]
*  It feels like this could be co-opted by bad people who would be like, let's do the thing where we pretend we're caroling and then we rob some houses. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5375.8s)]
*  Oh, gee whiz. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5382.8s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5383.8s)]
*  So could we do that lens. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5384.8s)]
*  The cynical guy. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5390.8s)]
*  My goodness. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5392.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5393.8s)]
*  This one is more based. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5394.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5396.8s)]
*  I'll do the other one that I think I don't think I've ever done the anti-scout. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5397.8s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5401.8s)]
*  This is a little bit like baseball because, you know, you sports right now. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5403.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5406.8s)]
*  Spending a lot of money, a lot of camps, traveling around multiple sports, people gunning for scholarships, a lot of pressure on the kids, a lot of pressure on the parents to keep up. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5407.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5420.8s)]
*  Oh, then you get to high school. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5421.8s)]
*  High school. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5423.8s)]
*  Oh, oh, there's a scout here. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5424.8s)]
*  Oh, oh my goodness. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5426.8s)]
*  Scout from college or a scout from the big leagues. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5428.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5432.8s)]
*  Guess what I got? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5434.8s)]
*  Anti-scout. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5436.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5437.8s)]
*  The parents get excited. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5438.8s)]
*  What a scout does, looking around for all the measurables, looking around to see if your kids got what it takes to make it at the next level. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5440.8s)]
*  The anti-scout comes to, you know, basically the parents have to hire the anti-scout. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5451.8s)]
*  Anti-scout goes, watches the games, does the same exact thing, then has a meeting with the parents, says, I want to tell you about a little Johnny. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5457.8s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5469.8s)]
*  He doesn't have what it takes. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5471.8s)]
*  You're like, yes, let's go. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5473.8s)]
*  We've saved 48,000 hours in expenses. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5476.8s)]
*  Good news. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5479.8s)]
*  Travel, camp. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5480.8s)]
*  Yeah, great news. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5481.8s)]
*  And he's got like an arsenal. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5482.8s)]
*  Like, you know, when there's ever like, like, it's always like Denzel Washington is always like out on, you know, Denzel Washington's trying to put his life back on the, you know, the straight and narrow. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5484.8s)]
*  But then he has to meet up with his old CIA partners like, I can't believe I have to do this. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5495.8s)]
*  And they have the one scene where he has all the guns and he's got to choose. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5499.8s)]
*  That's what the anti-scout has, like a table. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5503.8s)]
*  He's like, come on over here. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5506.8s)]
*  And he opens it up and it's just like a chess board. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5507.8s)]
*  There's like a clarinet there. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5510.8s)]
*  There's just like several books like engineering and coding and stuff like that. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5512.8s)]
*  The anti-scout, like you can, there's a recycling bin for all your baseball stuff, your cleats and stuff. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5518.8s)]
*  Like, oh, you're just out, you're out that day. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5525.8s)]
*  You can be out that day. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5527.8s)]
*  That's probably too aggressive. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5529.8s)]
*  That might, there might be a little more emotional. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5530.8s)]
*  So anti-scout comes in, he meets with Johnny's parents. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5533.8s)]
*  He's like, that's it. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5536.8s)]
*  And they're like, what do you think? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5538.8s)]
*  And he's like, honestly, I watched him run to first base when he hit that line drive single heavy legs. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5539.8s)]
*  And I don't think it ever changes. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5545.8s)]
*  He's slow, but he's not upset. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5547.8s)]
*  It's like, it's like, it's the way it is. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5549.8s)]
*  Yeah. No, you're happy about it. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5552.8s)]
*  It's like getting, it's like getting an offer. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5554.8s)]
*  Like you're getting thousands. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5556.8s)]
*  Like if you get a scholarship, you're saving thousands of dollars and everyone's thrilled. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5557.8s)]
*  If you get a positive review, which you're still saving, you're still saving the money, thousands of dollars. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5561.8s)]
*  You're like, I've got great news for you. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5567.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5569.8s)]
*  This guy should pick up. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5570.8s)]
*  You know, I think he's great with drum. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5572.8s)]
*  Maybe that's it. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5574.8s)]
*  Maybe we just headed somewhere else. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5575.8s)]
*  Like I think he's going to be a great windsurfer. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5577.8s)]
*  Like, really? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5580.8s)]
*  Like, yes. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5581.8s)]
*  When the anti-scout and parents like to text chains are always calling the anti-scout to come in. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5582.8s)]
*  You better play his best. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5588.8s)]
*  I love the anti-scout. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5590.8s)]
*  Also would be a fun sports movie. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5591.8s)]
*  That's a good take too. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5593.8s)]
*  I'll write that one up. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5595.8s)]
*  I got, all right. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5597.8s)]
*  I got another one for you. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5598.8s)]
*  This is probably my worst one, but I feel strongly bad. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5599.8s)]
*  This means it'll be the best. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5603.8s)]
*  Baby names. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5604.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5605.8s)]
*  When you're, when you're having a baby, we just had a couple of our friends have babies and it, there's like this whole thing where you don't really want to ask what, what they're thinking about a name. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5606.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5615.8s)]
*  Because they usually like some name. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5616.8s)]
*  And then if you weigh in and you're like, ah, then, you know, and you have some sort of take, it actually could get a little awkward. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5619.8s)]
*  So now we've hit this world where people kind of hoard the name and they're like, ah, we don't know. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5625.8s)]
*  But they always know. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5629.8s)]
*  You always know around month eight, you got like your three finalists. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5630.8s)]
*  But I'm always amazed by it. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5634.8s)]
*  And I just thought this because my dad just got a puppy because he's a psycho. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5636.8s)]
*  He's 77. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5640.8s)]
*  He just got a golden retriever puppy who, by the way, is a maniac. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5641.8s)]
*  But he was going to name the dog Sophie because they always have these IE names. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5644.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5649.8s)]
*  Good dogs. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5650.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5651.8s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5652.8s)]
*  They're, they're getting like this dog out of, they got the litter. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5654.8s)]
*  They got the first pick of the girls. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5657.8s)]
*  I was like, this dog is going to be a little bit alpha like, like Sophie sounds that and more importantly, there's a ton of Sophie's right now. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5659.8s)]
*  It's like there is. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5667.8s)]
*  It was like, yeah, don't do Sophie. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5668.8s)]
*  So, and we talked her in a name and the dog Ruby. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5670.8s)]
*  So we call her Rubes and you get all these nicknames out of it. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5672.8s)]
*  But it got me thinking he didn't realize that Sophie was such a popular name right now. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5675.8s)]
*  And what happens over and over again when people have the names, they don't do all the work to find out. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5682.8s)]
*  Like, oh, don't, don't name your kid Olivia. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5688.8s)]
*  There's like a million Olivia's right now. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5691.8s)]
*  You're just going to be like your kid's going to be Olivia W or Olivia S. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5693.8s)]
*  Because you're out of the mix. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5697.8s)]
*  If you're, if you don't. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5698.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5699.8s)]
*  So when we named our daughter Zoe, we were all excited about it because we didn't know any Zoe's, but we didn't realize is there had been a slow stealth Zoe Renaissance right before. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5700.8s)]
*  So Zoe gets into whatever she's in pre-k. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5711.8s)]
*  There's another Zoe, like one of her best friends right now is also named Zoe. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5714.8s)]
*  And there was like all of a sudden Zoe's, Olivia's, Emma's, Ava, they're all, you know. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5717.8s)]
*  So I looked up the top five names right now for girls are still Olivia, Amelia, Emma, Charlotte and Sophia. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5724.8s)]
*  And then there's Mia, Isabella, Ava, Evelyn, Luna. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5732.8s)]
*  Like you have two relatively young kids. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5735.8s)]
*  So you've seen a lot of these names in action. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5737.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5739.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5740.8s)]
*  The boys are Noah, Liam, Oliver, James and Elijah. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5741.8s)]
*  Oh, no Charlie. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5744.8s)]
*  Charlie. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5746.8s)]
*  We got a lot of Charlie's. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5747.8s)]
*  Charlie's a big one. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5748.8s)]
*  We got a lot of. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5750.8s)]
*  Liam's a big one. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5751.8s)]
*  Henry is in there. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5752.8s)]
*  Henry. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5753.8s)]
*  And nobody's zags the other way. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5756.8s)]
*  So that this is my half-baked idea. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5758.8s)]
*  Baby name consultant. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5760.8s)]
*  So you go in and does this exist? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5762.8s)]
*  I think it's straight up exists. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5765.8s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5767.8s)]
*  I think it's straight up exists. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5768.8s)]
*  Like it's like a service. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5770.8s)]
*  Yeah. I think there's people that do that. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5772.8s)]
*  Maybe I read about this that it was. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5775.8s)]
*  Oh, so Rudy says a hundred percent exists. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5777.8s)]
*  I have a half-baked idea that's I guess fully baked. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5779.8s)]
*  You have hit two fully baked ideas. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5783.8s)]
*  You're one away. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5788.8s)]
*  Well, I had a whole other thing where you could go into the baby name consultant and be like, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5789.8s)]
*  we're thinking of something in like a 1977. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5793.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think they do that. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5796.8s)]
*  And then they go back and they look. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5797.8s)]
*  And the biggest name in 1977 was Jennifer. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5798.8s)]
*  Followed by Melissa, Amy, Jessica, Heather and Angela. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5801.8s)]
*  By the way, names that no longer exist. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5804.8s)]
*  Those kids are not. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5806.8s)]
*  Oh, so really says it's in full infiltrated as I.G. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5808.8s)]
*  Algorithm. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5811.8s)]
*  Sure. He's about to have a kid. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5812.8s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5813.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5814.8s)]
*  Really? What's the name? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5815.8s)]
*  What's what? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5816.8s)]
*  Just come on the zoom. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5817.8s)]
*  So this hundred percent exists. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5818.8s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5820.8s)]
*  There's I'll get like three or four different women that come up and they basically like you email them like, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5821.8s)]
*  hey, I like Sophia, but I don't want Sophia. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5827.8s)]
*  And they'll give you like a list of names that are like kind of similar vibes come from the same origin. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5830.8s)]
*  Start with the same letter. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5835.8s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5836.8s)]
*  You know, it's very bougie. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5837.8s)]
*  I don't do that. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5838.8s)]
*  I just read lists all day. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5839.8s)]
*  We don't have this ever happen. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5840.8s)]
*  Half baked ideas where there's been a half baked idea. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5841.8s)]
*  Like, is this a sign that we're getting old? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5844.8s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5847.8s)]
*  No, I think that you just need you carve out your niche bill of like sports names. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5848.8s)]
*  Oh, that's the only that you like sports, a sports specific name, because I think I don't know if the baby consultants are huge sports fans. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5856.8s)]
*  So you could be like, hey, what about Gail Gail Goodrich Gail for a Gail Sayers? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5866.8s)]
*  No, Elgin. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5873.8s)]
*  Yeah, go all like 70s. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5874.8s)]
*  Yeah, like you could be like, like that. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5876.8s)]
*  I think works. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5879.8s)]
*  It's like how Jalen Rose Jalen's name took off. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5880.8s)]
*  Yeah, but now that you should be Jalen, Serenity, don't name your kid Jalen if you're having a boy. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5882.8s)]
*  But Jalen could be one of the founders of the new business. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5887.8s)]
*  It's like Jalen Rose. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5890.8s)]
*  Like, trust me, like I'm the godfather of all of this. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5891.8s)]
*  See, the reason I thought this was a half baked idea, because the move is just don't do anything that everybody else is doing in the last 10 years. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5895.8s)]
*  Go back like there's no Jennys anymore. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5902.8s)]
*  Jenny was the most popular name when we were growing up and there's like nobody wants to name their kid Jenny because all the adults all know people named Jenny and they want to zag. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5904.8s)]
*  But really, the move is to zag the other way and go with Jenny. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5913.8s)]
*  I know, but everyone is zagging. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5915.8s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5917.8s)]
*  Everyone's doing the opposite. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5919.8s)]
*  It feels like it's a big like grandma name phase right now, like names that were popular in like the 20s, 30s coming back. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5921.8s)]
*  He's going to mention this. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5926.8s)]
*  Yeah. If you go back to like Rachel, you know, just like a name from the 90s. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5927.8s)]
*  Kathleen. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5931.8s)]
*  Yeah, look, the trending names right now, Wilds, Arthur. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5932.8s)]
*  Rachel is in the Bible. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5935.8s)]
*  I don't know what the 90s were. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5936.8s)]
*  But like Rachel was a friend to the whole popularity thing. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5937.8s)]
*  I don't know any, do you know any babies named Rachel anymore? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5940.8s)]
*  No. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5943.8s)]
*  Well, the trending names right now, Arthur, Birdie, Celeste, Daphne and Dorothy. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5945.8s)]
*  So like the 1920s and 30s names are coming back. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5951.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5954.8s)]
*  We'll probably have a Marge and a Madge, all that stuff. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5955.8s)]
*  I like those. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5958.8s)]
*  So really, the thing you just, you just have to avoid having the name that your kid just has to have the last name initial next to their name for eight years. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5959.8s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds like Severance. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5968.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5970.8s)]
*  I was Zoe was in one class where there were three Zoe's and we were like, we thought like there were maybe we were just saying anyway, so really. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5971.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5980.8s)]
*  That one's fully big. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5981.8s)]
*  Thanks, Rudy. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5982.8s)]
*  Good job. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5983.8s)]
*  What's your next one? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5984.8s)]
*  Wiles. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5985.8s)]
*  Um, I've got moms know that one's no good. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5986.8s)]
*  I can't believe their baby name consultants that this is a job. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5991.8s)]
*  I'm just stunned by this. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5994.8s)]
*  This is a quick one. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5996.8s)]
*  I just get a quick take on it. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5997.8s)]
*  We went to Duke, Alabama. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=5999.8s)]
*  We sat on the baseline. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6001.8s)]
*  It was in New Jersey Prudential Center, I think. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6004.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6008.8s)]
*  And I hadn't been to a, I don't know, the last time I went to a, I went to the, I went to the Yukon game at the Garden. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6009.8s)]
*  But this was the first time I sat baseline and we were sitting near the Alabama band trombones the whole nine. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6015.8s)]
*  And it made me realize, and I mean, I think I'm, I think I'm right, but I, I hold out a chance that I'm just not, I'm misremembering it because the band was so we're next to the band. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6022.8s)]
*  That there was no music playing during the during the game. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6033.8s)]
*  Like there isn't an NBA game. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6039.8s)]
*  There was no like, oh yeah. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6041.8s)]
*  It was just in timeouts. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6044.8s)]
*  The band going crazy. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6046.8s)]
*  So I'm just putting it out there. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6048.8s)]
*  Bands at NBA games. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6051.8s)]
*  Bring them back. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6053.8s)]
*  Yeah, but you're Charlotte. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6055.8s)]
*  You're playing out the string. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6056.8s)]
*  Put a band in there and it's happier. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6058.8s)]
*  And it's great. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6059.8s)]
*  It's just livelier. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6060.8s)]
*  Like college games are like bands are underrated at this point. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6062.8s)]
*  I think the bands are underrated at weddings. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6067.8s)]
*  I think they're underrated at sporting events. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6069.8s)]
*  You're like, no, no, it's the DJ. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6072.8s)]
*  They can do like. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6074.8s)]
*  I know the DJ should be better, but just do the Pepsi challenge. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6075.8s)]
*  Have, you know, a DJ on a street corner playing a popular song and have a full on band. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6081.8s)]
*  The band is tremendous. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6090.8s)]
*  So an actual wedding band. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6093.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6095.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6096.8s)]
*  Full on kick ass brass band playing in timeouts, getting you fired up. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6097.8s)]
*  Symbols like it's just great. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6103.8s)]
*  It feels like you're there's something to it where, yeah, they're not hit songs, perhaps perhaps are just big symbol crashes. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6106.8s)]
*  But there's something about the liveness of it that like they're performing. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6114.8s)]
*  The game is happening. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6118.8s)]
*  There's something special that college sports captures with a band that gets lost in the NBA. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6120.8s)]
*  With a reliance on DJs and playing sound during the games, which I am not a fan of. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6127.8s)]
*  Nobody likes it. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6134.8s)]
*  And they do it because if you don't do it, it gets too quiet in the arena and then people can yell stuff and then people get upset. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6135.8s)]
*  The band thing, I would say one of the reasons is it's taking up space somewhere. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6141.8s)]
*  Oh, boo hoo. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6146.8s)]
*  Well, that's I'm just saying these guys are all greedy. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6148.8s)]
*  That's why we have 82 games instead of 70 because these guys are grabbing every dollar they can. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6150.8s)]
*  I mean, that does make sense. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6156.8s)]
*  Ballmer could have done it. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6158.8s)]
*  A lot of seats. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6159.8s)]
*  Yes, Ballmer could have done it. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6160.8s)]
*  Ballmer could have been like, I'm building the best arena ever. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6161.8s)]
*  And by the way, we're going to have a band and not like a college band. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6165.8s)]
*  It's going to be like a big ensemble, doobie brothers kind of band that during timeouts, it's like when a late night TV show goes to commercial. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6169.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6176.8s)]
*  And all of a sudden the band kicks in. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6177.8s)]
*  That's what we're doing, folks. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6178.8s)]
*  I think Steve Ballmer should do that. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6180.8s)]
*  Maybe he's listening. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6182.8s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6184.8s)]
*  100 percent he should do that. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6185.8s)]
*  I think it's good for everybody. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6187.8s)]
*  Everyone loves a band. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6188.8s)]
*  No one dislikes a band. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6189.8s)]
*  Great one. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6191.8s)]
*  What's your next one? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6192.8s)]
*  This one's too stupid. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6195.8s)]
*  I'm reluctant. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6197.8s)]
*  Oh, this is a quick another quick one that I have an insane one. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6198.8s)]
*  We have the jumping three pointer. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6201.8s)]
*  This is a little bit of like the torpedo bat. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6204.8s)]
*  The one legged three pointer like what Tatum does. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6207.8s)]
*  Jumping from the three point line to the foul line. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6211.8s)]
*  Like when this happens, there's a few things happening in sports that are so obvious. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6214.8s)]
*  Oh, so you jump but you don't shoot till your leg near the foul line. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6220.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6224.8s)]
*  So I'll give you just the background, the tush push. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6226.8s)]
*  Hey, I'm a quarterback sneak. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6230.8s)]
*  No, how about we get everybody and just push the guy forward? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6231.8s)]
*  Obvious, unstoppable, seems like a flaw. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6234.8s)]
*  I don't know why it didn't work before. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6237.8s)]
*  Number two. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6239.8s)]
*  Hey, a torpedo bats. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6240.8s)]
*  Hey, how about with a barrel? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6242.8s)]
*  The sweet spot. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6243.8s)]
*  We make that a little bit bigger and make a smaller part where no one ever hits the ball. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6244.8s)]
*  Wow, that works. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6248.8s)]
*  No brainer. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6249.8s)]
*  Old school. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6250.8s)]
*  Hey, how about we shoot more threes? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6251.8s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds good. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6253.8s)]
*  They're better than twos. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6254.8s)]
*  Yep. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6255.8s)]
*  Great. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6256.8s)]
*  The running three pointer is such an obvious idea. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6257.8s)]
*  I don't know why it's not happening. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6261.8s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the situations. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6263.8s)]
*  So you need to be like a three on two. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6265.8s)]
*  Every situation, every fast break, Yanis comes down and there's no standing. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6268.8s)]
*  You take off at the three point line. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6274.8s)]
*  Bare minimum, you're getting to the free throw line for a little mid range jumper. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6276.8s)]
*  So you think this is the new Euro step? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6281.8s)]
*  It's so obvious. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6283.8s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6285.8s)]
*  It's popped up on Instagram and Reddit and people have put like Dwayne Wade did it to win a game and he landed near the free throw line. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6286.8s)]
*  There's no, it's something. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6293.8s)]
*  I remember that game. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6295.8s)]
*  That was awesome when that happened. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6296.8s)]
*  You won the game. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6298.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6299.8s)]
*  Some team is going to do it. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6300.8s)]
*  Everyone's going to be like, is this allowed? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6302.8s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6304.8s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's where you take off. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6305.8s)]
*  It's always been that way, but no one's doing it for God knows why. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6306.8s)]
*  I like it. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6311.8s)]
*  There's no reason. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6312.8s)]
*  Is there any reason that there's videos on the Internet? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6313.8s)]
*  It's a college three guys doing basically long range finger rolls for three points. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6315.8s)]
*  Tatum's been messing around this one legged thing. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6321.8s)]
*  That's the way. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6324.8s)]
*  It's like a, yeah, I kind of enjoy it. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6325.8s)]
*  What's your last one? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6328.8s)]
*  This is my buddies. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6330.8s)]
*  I would told I told them I would do it. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6331.8s)]
*  I think it's insane, but you're performing other people's happy ideas. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6333.8s)]
*  I don't know if we would do this and it's Hulu specials like, hey guys, while you're still here, it has a whole bit I'm going to do. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6338.8s)]
*  Well, you know, sometimes I don't really take requests. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6346.8s)]
*  I'm not a DJ, but this one is okay. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6348.8s)]
*  Let's say half baked and I thought you would like it. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6350.8s)]
*  I will read you the text that he wrote me. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6352.8s)]
*  I have a joke premise that's looking for an audience and I'm not sure my friends who like sports nor my friends who like comedy will get it. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6354.8s)]
*  Good start. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6363.8s)]
*  That's what I said. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6364.8s)]
*  I'm intrigued already. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6365.8s)]
*  This is what he writes. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6367.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6368.8s)]
*  Transfer portal for families. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6370.8s)]
*  So I mean, it's a lot of it can go a lot of ways. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6376.8s)]
*  I'm gonna try to keep it above board. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6380.8s)]
*  But this is just like if my son has been doing well in sports, handsome kids, you know, he comes up to me one night like dad, can I talk to you for a minute? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6381.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, what's up? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6390.8s)]
*  I'm a hop in the portal. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6393.8s)]
*  Like, wow, really? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6394.8s)]
*  Like I spent I've invested so much in you like my time and I thought we had something like, no, no, you've been great. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6396.8s)]
*  You've been great. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6403.8s)]
*  But I'm just, you know, I think I can I'm going to move up to a kind of a better dad. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6405.8s)]
*  I like when I get to the West Coast, a nicer dad, you know, I got more opportunities out there. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6411.8s)]
*  But it would be nice. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6418.8s)]
*  Just like transfer portal for people having marital problems like, oh, yeah, I would say for the spouses, that's probably a better divorce. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6420.8s)]
*  I'm not getting divorced. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6430.8s)]
*  My wife just hopped. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6431.8s)]
*  I see. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6435.8s)]
*  I like the idea that transfer portal in general, because it works for NBA coaches. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6437.8s)]
*  It works for sports media people. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6442.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in the portal. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6444.8s)]
*  It's just now somebody's in the portal again. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6445.8s)]
*  I am in the way we're looking in the portal. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6447.8s)]
*  See what's going on. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6449.8s)]
*  Lose your job. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6450.8s)]
*  I hopped in the dogs in the portal. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6451.8s)]
*  Like, wow, you draw the line. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6453.8s)]
*  How's this? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6455.8s)]
*  How's going to portal? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6456.8s)]
*  Like, does everything go in the portal? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6457.8s)]
*  The portal is just like a nebulous concept. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6459.8s)]
*  Yeah, portal. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6463.8s)]
*  Everything's all right. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6465.8s)]
*  Here's my last one. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6466.8s)]
*  OK. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6467.8s)]
*  You know, NBA fantasy has just been destroyed. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6468.8s)]
*  I got it. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6472.8s)]
*  It's the worst. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6473.8s)]
*  It's been the worst for 15 years. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6474.8s)]
*  I played and I was like, this is the worst. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6475.8s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6477.8s)]
*  It is like the opposite of fantasy football. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6478.8s)]
*  And I think it's really hurt basketball because fantasy basketball was fun in the 90s. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6480.8s)]
*  That's good. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6484.8s)]
*  And then as the years went along, you know, whereas football, you care all the way through, partly through the prison, your fantasy guys. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6485.8s)]
*  And then you think about the end of the season, guys getting shut down, teams tanking. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6493.8s)]
*  Well, how do you make that more fun? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6498.8s)]
*  That's impossible. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6499.8s)]
*  Well, that's why I have NBA injury fantasy league. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6500.8s)]
*  OK. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6503.8s)]
*  So there's all star break happens. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6504.8s)]
*  We have our draft and you can draft players that are going to get prematurely shut down. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6506.8s)]
*  But you could also draft injuries and you could draft either as the rounds go along. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6513.8s)]
*  So maybe end up with six players and six injuries. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6519.8s)]
*  And then if the player you drafted gets the injury you drafted, you get triple points. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6522.8s)]
*  These are fake injuries. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6529.8s)]
*  No, these are the injuries they use. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6530.8s)]
*  I'll read you some of the injuries that they use to shut down players. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6532.8s)]
*  Fake injuries and not real injuries. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6536.8s)]
*  Tyrese Baxson, finger tendon. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6539.8s)]
*  I saw that. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6541.8s)]
*  Zion Williamson, lower back contusion. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6542.8s)]
*  CJ McCollum, bone contusion in his foot. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6547.8s)]
*  Paul George, submission was his left abductor muscle. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6551.8s)]
*  This is my favorite, Laurie Markkinen, who's missed some time with patellofomoro, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6555.8s)]
*  nine chondriosis with associated subchondrial edema. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6561.8s)]
*  I didn't know that could be a first round pick. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6565.8s)]
*  Yeah, non-chondriosis. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6567.8s)]
*  Darren Fox, extender tendon surgery. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6569.8s)]
*  So you just you have like 25 things, 25 kind of fake injuries that you couldn't really, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6572.8s)]
*  the league couldn't really crack down on, right? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6579.8s)]
*  Like, oh, lower back stiffness. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6581.8s)]
*  I guess take, I'll take your word for it. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6584.8s)]
*  Yeah, neck issues. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6589.8s)]
*  You draft all those, then you draft all the players in the tanking team, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6590.8s)]
*  and then you try to mix and match and try to, oh, I have Paul George and I have a knee injury. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6593.8s)]
*  Oh, Paul George and I had a left abductor muscle. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6598.8s)]
*  30 points. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6601.8s)]
*  And then you got half-faked idea. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6603.8s)]
*  But you can't drop bad injuries. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6608.8s)]
*  You can't be like torn ACL. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6610.8s)]
*  It's all like the fake ones. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6612.8s)]
*  For 10 ones. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6614.8s)]
*  Like corneal, corneal irritation. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6615.8s)]
*  Oh, that's a great pick. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6617.8s)]
*  I thought I was going to get corneal irritation in the fourth round. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6618.8s)]
*  Your half-fake ideas in this round have been all over the map. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6621.8s)]
*  It's real, like you, I think you evened out from two to 100% ideas in one 10% idea. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6625.8s)]
*  Yeah, it may need to be a 5% idea. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6632.8s)]
*  But you evened out to a half-faked idea, so you got it. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6635.8s)]
*  Thank you. I nailed it. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6637.8s)]
*  What's your closer? Do you have a closer? [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6639.8s)]
*  No, I think that was it. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6642.8s)]
*  Family portal, offensive lineman Santa. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6643.8s)]

*  Great. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6649.8s)]
*  Selling phone numbers, that's boring. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6650.8s)]
*  That's a real idea. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6651.8s)]
*  Wiles, I had a great time. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6652.8s)]
*  You can hear Wiles and watch him on First Things First on FS1. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-11qpYzECI&t=6653.8s)]
