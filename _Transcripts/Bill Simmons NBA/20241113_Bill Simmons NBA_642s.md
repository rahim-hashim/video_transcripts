# Should Philly Panic About Embiid? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8)
*  A former MVP returned tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=0.0s)]
*  Joel Embiid. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=3.52s)]
*  Came back and played the New York Knicks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=6.4s)]
*  And played for about five minutes and looked like he was gonna keel over. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=8.92s)]
*  Then he left. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=13.88s)]
*  Disappeared. Was he hurt? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=16.76s)]
*  Not sure. Came back, played some more. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=18.72s)]
*  Every time the game stopped, he was keeled over with both hands on his knees. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=21.96s)]
*  Like a 53 year old guy playing pickup. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  You know, over Thanksgiving. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=30.24s)]
*  It was pretty brutal. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=33.36s)]
*  Paul George looked good, Embiid did not. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=34.44s)]
*  And they lost. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=36.8s)]
*  And I guess this is just how it's going to go as Embiid. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=38.44s)]
*  Plays himself into shape. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=42.16s)]
*  I'm doing air quotes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=43.72s)]
*  Phillies two and eight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=46.32s)]
*  I don't really see how this Embiid thing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Goes over the next, I don't know, six, seven, eight weeks, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  but most of the scenarios are not good. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  There's a couple of scenarios that it's like three weeks from now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=58.68s)]
*  Oh, my God, Embiid, it's got his legs back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=60.68s)]
*  He just put up 48 on Orlando. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=63.16s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of other scenarios where it's like, yeah, Embiid, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=66.16s)]
*  they're going to have to shut it down again for a week or Embiid walked off again. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=69.12s)]
*  Or, oh, my God, when Embiid plays, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=73.12s)]
*  the other team has the highest offensive rebounding rate in the league [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=76.12s)]
*  because he just seems like he's anchored in the middle of the paint. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=79.16s)]
*  It's not great, Kirk. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=82.24s)]
*  No, they just gave him the extension. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=83.92s)]
*  They built this whole team. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=86.44s)]
*  They went all in. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=87.64s)]
*  There was a lot of like preseason hype as a possible champion, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=88.72s)]
*  which I thought was ludicrous. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=92.04s)]
*  It's not great. What are you seeing? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=95.04s)]
*  I saw one of the worst games I've ever seen Joel play today. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=97.12s)]
*  Two of 11 in 26 minutes, three rebounds. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=100.48s)]
*  This is supposed to be one of the most impactful players in the whole league, man. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=104.32s)]
*  And he took it easy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=108.48s)]
*  And he is, like you say, playing his way into shape. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=111.0s)]
*  But also the Sixers are playing their way out of any kind of postseason potential. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=114.4s)]
*  They're like two and eight. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  And it's a lot of Kyle Lowry, too, out there, because Maxey's hurt. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=121.72s)]
*  And I just don't know how much deeper they can dig. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=126.72s)]
*  And in normal year, they'd be screwed right now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=131.56s)]
*  But the East is so bad below the Cavs and Celtics. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=133.52s)]
*  There's still time for them to be fine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=137.4s)]
*  But what I need to see is more from Joel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=142.24s)]
*  He did not look active. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=145.08s)]
*  He did not look competitive. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=147.68s)]
*  And if that's what we're going to get this year or this fall, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=150.36s)]
*  like they're not going to be good period. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=153.72s)]
*  Jacoby was texting earlier. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=156.68s)]
*  He didn't seem very impressed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  Is that fair to say, Jacoby? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  If you give me 40 seconds to tell a personal story, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  I play a lot of goldentee, as you guys know, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  and I'm very good at goldentee. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=170.32s)]
*  I've got a profile. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=171.6s)]
*  I routinely just put up high scores and wherever I go. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=173.28s)]
*  People sometimes crowd around. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  I've played Bill and beaten Bill every time we played. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  But so natural. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=181.4s)]
*  And one time, the great Connor Shell sent me to Vegas to go to like [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  the Golden T World Championship. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=188.04s)]
*  And it was there that I found that I'm not good at goldentee. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=191.24s)]
*  I'm just the better than the people that happen to be in my proximity. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=196.68s)]
*  And I watched these men and women play goldentee to level that I was just [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=200.56s)]
*  not ready to be around. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=204.68s)]
*  And I felt like that's how Joel Embiid was this evening, because [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  and there was something I had much higher expectations for this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=211.44s)]
*  because he played in the Olympics. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  There was no reported surgery or injury or anything that serious. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  He had the suspension, which delayed his comeback even further. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=220.44s)]
*  And I actually saw him in pregame and his arms were kind of skinny. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=223.56s)]
*  And I was like, oh, look, he's he's in shape. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=226.88s)]
*  But he was he was me playing professional goldenteers tonight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=229.0s)]
*  He was not ready for the speed and just the physicality of NBA basketball. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=233.0s)]
*  There's I remember one rebound [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  bounce off the rim and you watch enough NBA basketball as we do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=239.28s)]
*  You're just kind of used to the rhythm of how things work. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=243.16s)]
*  And it was his rebound. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  It was a rebound for Joel Embiid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=247.32s)]
*  And as a Knicks fan, I'm assuming that we're going the other way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  And Kat just kind of circled around it, but grabbed it and put it back. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=252.84s)]
*  And I was like, what was that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=257.0s)]
*  It was like he wasn't even trying. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=258.32s)]
*  So this was more of a me problem that I expected so much more [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=259.88s)]
*  from Joel Embiid because he looked like someone who hadn't played for two years [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  and was just kind of like coming back and should have come off the bench. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So this this was something that became a real problem for them [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=273.52s)]
*  in the playoffs, him protecting the boards from offensive rebounders, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=277.28s)]
*  people crashing, people out hustling on basically. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=281.56s)]
*  There's a big reason why the Knicks won that series. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=284.32s)]
*  Then you go to the Olympics. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=286.88s)]
*  It was a big reason why Kerr had trouble playing him, even when he was like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=288.64s)]
*  able to score like even against when they played Jokic. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=292.04s)]
*  Jokic had four fouls and he put a couple of shots, but he was still like giving up [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=295.88s)]
*  the boards and it just it feels like when you watch Embiid, when he [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=300.2s)]
*  he can still get the shots that he wants, whether they go in or not, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=305.0s)]
*  whether he's in shape or not, it just seems like he can barrel around, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=309.64s)]
*  whirl around, he can get positioned near the basket. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=313.28s)]
*  But what goes are the protecting his own rim [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  when he's on defense and just the speed of just being able to move around [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=320.2s)]
*  where it just seems like he's doing this as guys are kind of flying around him. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  And then there's a clumsiness that seems to ratchet up [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=329.64s)]
*  when the less in shape he is around the basket, where he'll get in position [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=332.64s)]
*  and then he'll just come crashing down. I just. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=336.8s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=340.56s)]
*  I really feel like there there might have been too many injuries [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  for him to come back for at the level that he was at two years from now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=344.72s)]
*  So this has now become one of the big stories of the year is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  and people are going to go, well, he's hurt. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  He's got to play himself back in shape. Well, it's mid November. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=354.44000000000005s)]
*  You know, the Sixers got eliminated from the playoffs at the end of April. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=358.16s)]
*  He didn't have to play in the Olympics. He did. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=362.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't know how you can't. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  Why you can't stay in shape when you're rehabbing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  I guess I just don't understand enough about if your knee hurts, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  aren't there still ways to stay in shape so you don't look like you're completely, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=375.08s)]
*  completely, completely gassed four minutes into a basketball game? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=380.2s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=385.44s)]
*  Can I ask you guys a question? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=386.52s)]
*  If this were Shaq, right, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=389.24s)]
*  if you're tracking Shaq's career from Orlando all the way through the end, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  what era Shaq is 20, 20 for Joel Embiid? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=394.8s)]
*  Really important point. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=398.36s)]
*  And it's something we talked about this summer. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=399.68s)]
*  Like, this is what happens to big guys. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=401.56s)]
*  So right now he's in like 2000. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=404.36s)]
*  What he looked like tonight, he's in like the 2008 Phoenix range. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=407.12s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=411.32s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=412.68s)]
*  Phoenix era. And it's not pretty. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=413.6s)]
*  But this is what it looks like. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=416.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. Like it doesn't make 11 years. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=418.52s)]
*  You know. I don't know. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=424.0s)]
*  I'd be I'd be losing my if I was Sixers fan, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  I'd be losing my mind. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=429.36s)]
*  I would just be like, how did all of this happen? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=431.24s)]
*  Why did he play in the Olympics? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=433.36s)]
*  What? Why didn't you tell us what happened with him with his [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  with his legs before the season started? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=438.44s)]
*  Why was there all this mystery around it? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  Is he healthy now? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=442.76s)]
*  What's wrong with him now? Can you tell us? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=444.36s)]
*  And it just seems like they're, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=446.88s)]
*  I don't know, being super tightlipped about everything. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  Plus, they gave him the extension, which is the other piece of this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=451.12s)]
*  Like they gave him this massive extension, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=454.0s)]
*  which is very similar to what happened to Pelicans with Zion. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=456.16s)]
*  They kind of double down on somebody who had never really shown [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  that they could stay healthy for that long. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=462.16s)]
*  And that's you start doing that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=463.92s)]
*  It's you can't come back from that with the way the cap is now. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. Bum me out. I like watching him be when he's healthy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  And I just the guy tonight didn't even look close. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=472.0s)]
*  There's a version of this where after the All-Star game, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  he's back to being MVP and be because we've seen we've seen peak [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=477.8s)]
*  and be to be absolutely dominant just this night after night, not just scoring. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=481.56s)]
*  Like, do you remember when they used to just like give it to him [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=485.44s)]
*  at the nail and like run around him and he would just either if you backed off [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=488.76s)]
*  him, he would turn and shoot or he would back you down if he had a mismatch. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=492.84s)]
*  Like there was a while where they would just I think Doc was the coach [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  where they just give it to him at the foul line. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=499.08s)]
*  And just that's how they started their offense. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=500.8s)]
*  And it was beautiful because he was playmaking. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=502.68s)]
*  He was shooting. He was going to the rim. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  He was step backing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=507.36s)]
*  And now it just seems like that guy just doesn't exist anymore. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=508.56s)]
*  How do you say how does the play out for you, Kirk? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=512.48s)]
*  Because I'll tell you this, I've been around a long time [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=515.28s)]
*  and we talked about this over and just with the history of the league. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=517.92s)]
*  And I was talking about how Blake Griffin was a good example of this, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=521.4799999999999s)]
*  who had a different set injuries than Embiid did. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=524.16s)]
*  But at some point, there were too many of them. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=525.9599999999999s)]
*  And it passed the point of no return and you can't come back. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=529.12s)]
*  And that's what we've seen over and over again. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=531.64s)]
*  Zion's a really unusual case because it just seems over and over again. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=533.8s)]
*  It's hamstrings. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=537.12s)]
*  And like I was driving around my wife yesterday and I had terminated Eddie [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=538.5999999999999s)]
*  on they were talking about him and my wife was like, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=542.16s)]
*  I don't understand if how do you have like chronically bad hamstrings? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=545.76s)]
*  Like you just have to stretch and stay hydrated. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  What's wrong with this guy? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=551.64s)]
*  And I was like, honey, we've been asking this for six years. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=552.72s)]
*  There is no answer. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=556.92s)]
*  What? Why does she listen to terminating Eddie with you? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=560.16s)]
*  Like spousal abuse? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=562.84s)]
*  Better question. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=565.0s)]
*  She it was her listening after five minutes straight of her going, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=566.52s)]
*  get these guys off and put music on. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=570.36s)]
*  I was like, I just want to hear this top part. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=572.4s)]
*  Of those guys, I think to answer your question, I think. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=575.84s)]
*  This is my am first of all, Shaxx, a better player, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  but I would put him in that optimistically, the Miami era Shaq. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=582.64s)]
*  I think there is six Shaq. OK, I think there's a chance [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=586.48s)]
*  that he is still capable of turning a corner and getting in shape. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=590.2s)]
*  So I think that's the optimistic version. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  I think the pessimistic version is Phoenix Shaq, which is like, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=598.48s)]
*  we're never going to see what we thought we were used to seeing ever again. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=601.24s)]
*  So it feels like he has about 30 games to figure this out. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  And if he doesn't, that contract is going to be [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=610.44s)]
*  an albatross playing it simple. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=613.84s)]
*  Like an all timer. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=615.76s)]
*  And part of me wonders why they brought it back at all. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=617.24s)]
*  I don't understand what the upside was of putting him out. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=620.24s)]
*  It just feels like it would be way easier for him to get hurt worse [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=623.6s)]
*  than than whatever upside you get from actually playing him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqI8b_jvqz8&t=627.32s)]
