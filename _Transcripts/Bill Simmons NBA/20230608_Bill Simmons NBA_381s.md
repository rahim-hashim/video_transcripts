# Jokic Is the Undisputed Best Player in the World | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syXODAoskDA)
*  I've got one for you, Bill.
*  Oh, can I give you another one?
*  Yeah, it's a it's a way because you criticize, you know,
*  you got to give jokers flowers, but you have to make it a little bit debatable.
*  So I'm going to I'm going to use the word.
*  Undeniably is Joker undeniably
*  the best player in the world.
*  Oh, 100, 100 percent.
*  Not one vote out of the you get 100 votes.
*  Are you putting all of your chips on the best player in the world?
*  Roulette table on Joker.
*  All of them.
*  I mean, this is why Wilds is wild.
*  That's first of all, great idea.
*  This is what you can also have it tomorrow for you.
*  Imagine if he was awake.
*  Imagine if he was awake to if he was awake, you'd have to be crushing.
*  Yeah, I'm crushing awake.
*  Wilds would have come up with that five minutes ago,
*  but even even half asleep, wilds finally get over there.
*  So I think this is actually this is almost a turn the camera on Kyle,
*  even though we don't have Kyle today, we have Craig.
*  I think it's actually undisputed that he's the best player in the world now.
*  Because even the bad Jokic game is like a 2012 and nine.
*  Right. And a game like today where it's like this would be
*  if basically any other player in the league
*  other than, you know, LeBron and his prime or whatever,
*  if somebody just casually threw up the 32, 21, nine or 10.
*  People would lose their minds.
*  Like if Jason Tatum did that, I would be like telling my grandkids,
*  oh, my God, this game Jason Tatum had.
*  But Joker, we're not even surprised anymore.
*  So for me, I just feel like he's consistently so good
*  game after game with the ceiling of, you know, supreme
*  that to me, he's the number one guy now.
*  Chico, it's impossible to disagree with that,
*  but I would say that you can have the conversation,
*  especially about Yannis and Kevin Durant.
*  Like I agree.
*  I think you'll get just the best player on the planet.
*  Sailed. No, I disagree.
*  No. Oh, I think that I think that ship's done.
*  He's he's too old and too banged up now.
*  He's the top eight guy, but I don't he's not in the conversation for me anymore.
*  It's I was thinking Yannis when you were speaking,
*  but then you said he had a 32, 20 and 10 game.
*  And I just I can't imagine a world in which Yannis does that.
*  I would have known it would be.
*  Curry is the only other guy for me that is allowed to be in the combo.
*  So do you think there's any recency bias
*  because we literally watched the game a half hour ago
*  when Yannis had a closeout game of 50 and 14
*  and average 35, 13 and five to win finals MVP.
*  And then two years later, we're like, no, sorry.
*  Yelled the title belt for 18 months.
*  But now it's jokers. Great point.
*  Yannis had it two years ago.
*  He had it last year and I think Yoko took it this year
*  because the last thing Yoko had to do
*  was do this at the highest stage, which he's now done.
*  And I have no questions left.
*  And he also against Davis and LeBron swept them
*  and laid it to them in a way that he just couldn't do a couple of years ago
*  in the bubble, right in the bubble.
*  That was a different matchup.
*  Little younger LeBron, healthier Davis, but still.
*  Can I give you another one, Bill?
*  Oh, so Rudy's asking me is Yoko number one, the trade value rankings now.
*  Oh, I think 100 percent. Absolutely. Yes.
*  You are not trading him for anybody, anybody on the planet.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I think before it was Yannis, Luca and Yoko three.
*  And now I think it's a flip because the thing with Yoko is.
*  I just don't see any reason this can't go on at this level
*  for like five, six more years.
*  What's he going to lose speed?
*  That's about to say, what's he going to lose speed in athleticism?
*  OK, he's not like Bird.
*  Bird, his body just broke down, right?
*  But he was also older when he came into the league.
*  So he was like probably 32, 33 when he really started breaking down.
*  And Dirk really all the way through maybe 2012,
*  the same kind of like weird kind of body, but he started to slow down a little bit.
*  But he was in his early 30s, too.
*  I think at least three, four more years while it's for Yoko at this level.
*  I don't I don't see why he wouldn't.
*  I'm buying that.
*  I bet he becomes a better shooter, too.
*  The other question I would have for you if we're still playing this game.
*  Yeah, it is ready to call Jamal Murray a superstar.
*  No, that's that's a great.
*  That's like a eight thirty first take topic.
*  Like just get our half in the show.
*  Yeah, it's not not in the first hour, but like halfway through the second hour.
*  Are you go, Jacob's? I'm not ready to answer yet.
*  I'm not. I think I think superstars is a very different thing than star.
*  I think there's like a handful of superstars and I am not calling Jamal Murray
*  a superstar. No.
*  Yeah, I don't think I am either.
*  It just it just no.
*  I mean, he's not one of the top ten players in the league.
*  Just no. Yeah.
*  So what so how many players are superstars?
*  Probably less than 10.
*  Yes, seven. Yeah.
*  So that's so everyone has their own.
*  Nick does club superstar on the show.
*  He I think he capped it at 12, but everybody has their own.
*  I always want to sneak people in the fire exit.
*  I'm always trying to get other people and get Donovan Mitchell in.
*  So John John there, did you did?
*  John, I'm a little scared.
*  I kicked out of the bar after the after the next year.
*  They sent him home to Jockett through metal detectors.
*  Now, he made it.
*  He made it.
*  I mean, he jocks left club superstar.
*  I don't know. He's close.
*  Jamal Murray is just making buckets.
*  He's close.
*  And if you look at his numbers next to Jimmy,
*  he doesn't have a cool nickname.
*  But if you put him, the numbers, just him versus Jimmy.
*  You know, well, he's he's there where he the thing is,
*  if he was your number one guy in a team, I'm not sure how many rounds you're winning,
*  which I think is the final definition of superstar.
*  But what I think he's proven is he can absolutely be the number two
*  on a team that wins a title, which is probably what's going to happen.
