# Bill Simmons’s “One More Time” NBA Teams | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8XVXN8zKcY)
*  You mentioned the phrase one more time on your podcast on Friday.
*  Sorry, I'm grabbing ideas from your podcast, but sometimes when I hear other people's podcasts, I'm like, oh, he, he raced over that.
*  That was actually a good gimmick.
*  The Quippers are the all time staring at whatever fucking whiteboard they have with other names and their salaries, trying to decide whether you're trade Paul George or not.
*  And they kind of look around and they go, what do you think?
*  One more time.
*  And everybody's like, yeah, one more time.
*  Let's go.
*  So we're going to try to figure out how many one more time teams there are.
*  It's, it's the cousin of one last job.
*  The action movie gimmick where the guy's kind of out.
*  It's like, no, one last job, man.
*  I know the guy who runs this bank.
*  Oh, not the title.
*  You mean just the overall.
*  Thank you.
*  The concept like, ah, one, one last job.
*  What could go wrong?
*  Um, the Quippers, the mirror.
*  What's the movie where the cop gets diagnosed with a terminal illness and he thinks, is that.
*  Out of time.
*  Oh, Denzel Washington.
*  No, no, you got to go way back for this one.
*  I forget this guy.
*  He's a white guy.
*  He's around.
*  He's kind of a that guy award type of white guy.
*  And I think he was the star maybe one of the few movies he was a star of.
*  Um, and it was like a comedy, but he just went crazy because he thought it was like,
*  I'm just about to retire.
*  It's you know what?
*  I was thinking, I was screwing up the, like whenever the cop has mentioned that he's
*  retiring soon in the beginning of a show or a movie, he can shop with 10.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the lethal whip whip a gimmick.
*  So we both think Quippers, this is a one more time team.
*  I can't imagine, especially with the new stadium opening in a year that it's like,
*  well, if it doesn't work out this year, one more year after that, I actually thought
*  it was very conceivable and possible that they would trade Paul George.
*  Cause I don't think Hawaii has a lot of trade value and maybe try to turn him into
*  something else, but I don't know what the market was for him, how serious the next
*  talks were, whether there's a Sacramento element that could possibly happen.
*  Um, but all indications seem that the Quippers are going to just, you could
*  talk, if you're them and you spend enough time and maybe have enough drinks, you
*  can go through every season and talk yourself into, well, if that hadn't
*  happened and talk yourself into a bad luck angle for each season.
*  But the problem is Kawhi, um, and Paul George has have just had a ton of bad
*  luck in their entire career and you're betting on the two bad luck guys, which
*  goes back to your Brogdon point, maybe not bring Brogdon into that home make.
*  So we, you agree that the Quippers are one more time team?
*  Uh, yeah, we should call it the daft punk teams.
*  This is, this is a no brainer.
*  Like if we were drafting it, which I'm actually surprising how gimmicky we can
*  get here, we're not drafting it, but that's fine.
*  Uh, the Clippers, I just always think about the team.
*  I think about the guys, Lawrence Frank, the whole crew, they're going over
*  everything and they go, okay, what are the options gang?
*  And you're like, well, the best options are guys are right.
*  So fuck it.
*  Let's just do one more year, maybe not extend these guys, but do one more year.
*  They've got player options that total almost a hundred million
*  between the two of them.
*  They can figure it out.
*  Uh, you know, I thought the Paul George, Trey young thing was least interesting
*  last week, but then I started thinking about it more, I got a couple of texts.
*  It was like, that's actually, even though I think the Jean pay and then Paul
*  George and going, okay, positionally wise, maybe you've got like considering
*  he's 33 with his injury history and you have to make a contract decision.
*  I'm something else.
*  Like it's actually whatever they get Trey young.
*  That's not enough for Trey.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not enough for Trey young, especially when you consider kind of the Zion,
*  New Orleans, Trey Atlanta thing of how important he is to that city for that
*  franchise, like there's an extra bump in value, almost like the Ewing stuff with you.
*  So when you, when we go over these teams and be like, they can't run that back
*  again, a lot of times I'm like, yeah, they probably will though.
*  And I don't blame them.
*  Do you?
*  Yeah.
*  Like they, they probably sketched out a whole, what's the best possible next
*  deal we can make conversation, right?
*  And it's like, all right, at two o'clock we'll deep dive, OB topping.
*  And there's through all the players.
*  And then at some point you go out when Paul George is healthy,
*  he's still really fucking good.
*  Let's try it.
*  Let's see if we can try to keep him healthy.
*  All right.
*  So we think the Quippers running back.
*  I still feel like they'll be more than willing to take somebody's longer
*  contract for one of their one year and you can get rid of them guys.
*  And maybe that's where they'll operate in.
*  Oh, you want to get off money in 2024, 25.
*  Well, we'll take that back.
*  Cause maybe they'll care a little less.
*  I really, really, really don't want people to sleep on the whole new building part
*  with the Quippers cause they're taking a huge risk.
*  They're building this basketball only building that's in Inglewood where the
*  Lakers used to be a long time ago.
*  It's next to the football stadium.
*  It's not really near anything.
*  Right.
*  And they're the Quippers anyway, nobody cares about the Quippers out here.
*  They have their small.
*  It's a lot like the Kings where they have their, their small loyal group of fans.
*  And other than that, they kind of come and go depending on how relevant they are.
*  And I just don't, I don't see them going into that first season with that
*  arena and not having star power.
*  So if they're looking at that, from that perspective, you're better off, keep
*  your fingers crossed with Paul George would be my take.
*  I also think this makes them a Zion possibility because that's a star power
*  guy, right?
*  Come to our new arena.
*  We have Zion Williamson.
*  Maybe we might have Zion Williamson.
*  If we might, he might play today or he might be in a jogging suit.
*  Cause it's also worth at least mentioning too.
*  Like if you were to trade Paul George, what is, what is, what happens with
*  Kawhi and I'm being sarcastic cause he's a super easy dude to predict.
*  Although maybe he is in a non sarcastic way, pretty easy to predict.
*  Cause you just, the predictable part is that you'll never know with him.
*  Um, but the new building thing, all those factors, much like, you know,
*  tray's importance to Houston and all this stuff that we've already talked about here.
*  So you're right.
*  Like, I don't think they're going to want to go in there saying we have the rights
*  to Portland's pick top six protected in 2025.
*  Are you interested in a luxury suite for your business?
*  You know, would you like to sign up for our first six Rose club?
*  All right.
*  Let's make it a draft.
*  You have the second pick.
*  Who's your one more time team?
*  Golden state excited when you said the word draft.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Uh, golden state.
*  Oh, really?
*  What you think maybe our definition of the parameters here, I looked at it as
*  going into this off season being like, we're just going to run it back.
*  No, I had them as well.
*  I was just trying, I was trying to make the draft more exciting.
*  Uh, I do think if they trade Draymond, I mean, I'm sorry, if they re-signed Draymond,
*  then you could say it's one more time.
*  But the heart of this team is Steph Curry and Draymond and we'll,
*  maybe we'll bring Clay back.
*  But I think there's some one more time element with Clay.
*  I think Clay is a really, really proud fucking dude.
*  Not that a lot of these guys aren't, but I just don't see him.
*  His price has been set in the forties.
*  He's not going to get that again, but I don't see him.
*  Taking the huge pay cut.
*  Just like I don't see Draymond taking the huge pay cut.
*  I think all these guys feel like they were part of this dynasty.
*  They feel like it was a dynasty and you know, it's like when Colby took that
*  giant contract the last two years, they just destroyed their calf space.
*  He was like, fuck that.
*  I deserve it.
*  I deserve all this money.
*  I keep this stadium.
*  So this is what I deserve.
*  And I think Clay's could be like that.
*  So I'm paper one more time team because of the Chris Paul contract, but I still
*  feel like the nucleus is going to be there for them.
*  Okay.
*  But I also think it's important to bring up the pool stuff because, you know, it's
*  a bit like the Beale thing where, yeah, I get it.
*  That trade for Beale.
*  Like, of course that price, are you kidding?
*  But it wasn't a normal trade.
*  It wasn't like other trades because he got the no trade clause and that felt
*  more like him going to one of two places.
*  So you're not even, he's not even a market.
*  You don't even have teams bidding.
*  I mean, that's what's so terrible about that.
*  No, they destroyed his value.
*  I don't, I still don't know why they did that.
*  Yeah, no, something it's funny.
*  You bring that up.
*  Do you just go Darrell Maury, which is why I respected what he did with
*  Simmons so much with Philly.
*  I don't think a lot of GMs would have allowed that to go as long as it did.
*  And Darrell wasn't going to do it until he got his price and thank God he got his
*  price because he turned Ben Simmons who doesn't play into Harden and no matter
*  what you think of Harden, like that's a massive win and he got it because he was
*  patient.
*  He's like, Hey, that the offers suck.
*  These offers suck and I'm not going to do it.
*  So, you know, whatever you don't want to play.
*  Fine.
*  I think other GMs would have given into that a little bit.
*  And that's why when I think about the Beale thing, you know, that could have
*  been overdrive owner driven new front office coming in, clean slate move on.
*  But if that's, you have to wonder, I'm so glad you brought it up because you have
*  to wonder at some point, if you were Michael winger, if you just go, Hey,
*  actually, no, no.
*  Right.
*  I actually liked the trade they got.
*  I liked all those pick swaps and I liked Jordan P a pool.
*  I'd rather pay Jordan pool.
*  Um, the, the 30 and you get Tyus Jones, you get to potentially flip him in
*  February, but just, I feel like pool could match a lot of Beale stats.
*  He's not as good of a player, but production wise offensively, he could put
*  together a lot of the same numbers.
*  Okay.
*  But the final thing, 20 million less, the pool thing though, like having those
*  numbers then be gone later on, unlike Beale where the numbers continue, you
*  know, that's, that's the part of the Phoenix deal where you're like, okay, are
*  you sure?
*  And they felt like they were so all in and for the price that they got them,
*  like, who cares?
*  And they still are on the line of, of teams that, you know, could this team be
*  a contender, I think it'd be crazy to just say no about Phoenix, but with pool,
*  maybe his contract now being all those future numbers gone, whether it's Chris
*  Paul after this year, not being resigned for that kind of number, whatever they
*  do with Wiggins, maybe they look at it as like, we can sign all these guys and
*  whatever you think the tax calculations are for Dramam, cause I have those on
*  like different versions of what his deal is and what him leaving for nothing
*  versus him coming back at like 90 million.
*  The gap between that is like the tax bill is so insane and we'll run through it a
*  little bit later.
*  Like maybe they go, okay, now that pool's gone, we feel even better about extending
*  out some of these dues, but hopefully not at the 40 and 30 million averages
*  they're used to.
*  And it's okay to get crushed this year.
*  It seems like, um, when it gets to two, three years down the road, that's when
*  you got to be a little more careful.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to go with my one more time team draft.
*  Uh, I'm going to say New Orleans, but it's Zion specific.
*  I think this, this has to be your last year doing the Zion dance.
*  And I actually think, I really do think that if there was a trade for him this
*  week, it would have happened.
*  And I just don't know if any other team felt comfortable.
*  There there's such a disparity in what New Orleans probably feels like Zion's
*  value is versus what the rest of the league looking at it from afar probably
*  thinks it is that you have no chance.
*  What was the trade going to be?
*  You know, it's, it just wasn't going to happen, but I think New Orleans is like,
*  all right, let's try to figure out how to make this go.
*  Would it shock me if he wasn't on the team to start the season?
*  No.
*  But, you know, I just always look at it from like what Tommy Shepard, when he
*  gave Bradley Beale that no trade clause, he kind of felt like I gotta keep
*  Bradley Beale here or otherwise I'm not going to have a job in here.
*  And it's turned out he lost his job anyway.
*  If you're Griffin and the Zion thing doesn't work out after another year,
*  and now he's untradeable, who gets blamed after that?
*  It's the GM.
*  That's how the league works.
*  Would you have done three for Zion if you were Portland?
*  I think I would have.
*  I mean, Simon's would have had to be in that too.
*  Right.
*  And I would make a knurkage.
*  I think I would have, but you and I are higher on Zion the most, but I, I, it's
*  really tough because I love scoot too, but I just feel like, you know, I think
*  I just feel like that's a better trade.
*  Cause now I can keep Dame for versus what I'm looking at 50, 60, 70 cents on
*  the dollar for Dame because there's no perfect trade for him.
*  And I don't, I don't, I don't mean to be dismissive of Simon's like as if
*  he's a throne, cause he's not, but then you've got CJ scoot.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just weird.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know, it would have been harder than do the contracts.
*  You're right.
*  Would you say to be Jeremy Grant sign and trade or something, but that, but
*  that's the point there's no trade that would have made it with the contract
*  that would have had to take back.
*  It just, there was no trade.
*  Who says no Ingram for Simon's and three.
*  So I wonder if that was discussed because that was kind of the, if I'm Portland,
*  I, I would have had to really think about that.
*  I thought Ingram was the last second half of last year.
*  I was really impressed by him.
*  He's still pretty young too, right?
*  Isn't it like 25, 26, 26, 26 in September.
*  He's awesome.
*  I mean, you know, I think I would have done that.
*  I think he'd be awesome with Dame like awesome.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  And so I lose Simon's.
*  Do I have to lose Nurkic in that too?
*  Can I get rid of Nurkic?
*  No, you want to get rid of Nurkic.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I mean.
*  I, Nurkic, you have to take Nurkic if I'm giving you, I'd be like, can we have
*  Jackson Hayes weird ass or read some, we can, right.
*  Can we get one of your, your bigs back?
*  Um, now, so New Orleans wouldn't, wouldn't have done that.
*  New Orleans wouldn't have done that.
*  I don't think they would have cause they'd be like, wait, what if we trade
*  Ingram and then Zion's hurt again?
*  So, you know, our two best players are both out of the mix.
*  You could argue, okay, Ingram doesn't play enough.
*  He's only played 70 games once in his career.
*  That was his rookie year.
*  Uh, you know, granted a couple of those seasons were pretty close to full
*  seasons on the shortened one.
*  He only played 45, but when he came back this year and he was a little slow,
*  when he came back, he missed some time.
*  But man, when he came back, I thought he was nasty.
*  And, uh, I just think he'd be perfect fit.
*  Now, Dame all of a sudden, like it may be an investment in Dame being like, Hey,
*  now we don't have to get Miami updates every week because he's happy that he
*  has Ingram on the team, but I think New Orleans probably says no, because they're
*  like, well, if you get rid of Ingram and then Zion's hurt again, but back to your
*  original point, they're, they're a perfect example of running it back one more time.
*  I think leading up to the draft, that's what you were hearing more and more of.
*  Like, look, just give it one more shot.
*  Zion's young enough.
*  They still have them under contractual control.
*  Uh, if the offers aren't good enough, I don't know how different the market would
*  be if he also misses even more time this year, cause I imagine it'd probably still
*  be a little similar to what they were being offered and they probably didn't
*  like leading up.
*  So I don't have a problem with it because he's a star in a city that's
*  not going to get a star.
*  You have the next pick.
*  So far we took the Clippers Golden state in New Orleans and the one more
*  time, one last job draft.
*  I'm going to zag a bit because I think they're just going to run it back and
*  no one's going to be excited about it.
*  I think Chicago is going to be a pretty similar team.
*  Oh,
*  I might've been on the trade machine team this weekend, trying to figure out a
*  Brogdon Caruso Celtics, take back Lonzo and just how those salaries could work.
*  And then all of a sudden I brought Charlotte into it and Gordon Heyward was
*  involved and Lonzo was going to Charlotte and I was just basically trying to figure
*  out how to get the Celtics Caruso in a realistic way and I couldn't pull it off.
*  But you know what the ringer looks like?
*  Lanzo is out for the year and he has some injury exception, right?
*  So they can use half of his money on somebody else.
*  They will.
*  Right.
*  I think Chicago brings back Boosevich.
*  I don't think Zach really has a market with the four playoff games in nine years.
*  I don't think there's a line outside the Zach door right now.
*  And then DeRozan is on a good contract and maybe you look to trade him December,
*  December, January range.
*  Now you're like, so what is, what is your training camp like where you're
*  like trying to get the fans excited?
*  You're like, oh, Patrick Williams, you should see him go to his left now.
*  Worked on it all summer.
*  Like what, what are your boots?
*  We were so close to beating Miami in that playing game.
*  People forget.
*  Like we were right there.
*  How do you get your fans fired up?
*  Yeah.
*  Cause blowing it up, you know, I, I look, I actually feel bad for Chicago.
*  They were right about the DeRozan thing when it felt like all of us were wrong.
*  I was wrong.
*  I'm like, how much, how like what?
*  And then he takes it to another level.
*  The voodge trade was bad.
*  The voodge trade was irresponsible.
*  Right.
*  But they thought.
*  Like, I don't know.
*  It was ridiculous.
*  Right.
*  But I'm just saying like part of, I'm admitting one of my flaws in that sometimes
*  you feel bad, like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think it's sympathy.
*  It's just that we were so conditioned to think that every move like had to be,
*  oh, does that mean like, I just hate talk radio shit where like the trade happens.
*  And it's like, does that guarantee you a title?
*  You're like, no dickhead.
*  It doesn't.
*  Yeah.
*  You win.
*  Okay.
*  How about the five seed?
*  Is that good?
*  Is the five seed good for you?
*  Like you win the argument, man.
*  Let's take some calls or any move that's not tanking.
*  If you're not, yeah.
*  Like, I'll just never forget, like being on the set once with Bob Ryan, where the
*  Celtics made some minor move and then I think Felger may have said like, yeah,
*  but is this, does this like championship driven and Bob Ryan's like, who cares?
*  This team isn't that good.
*  Just being better would be nice.
*  And it made an impression on me because sometimes I'll look at these teams and
*  just go, Hey, we're just trying to get better.
*  We're trying to compete.
*  And I think that's what Chicago did.
*  And then everybody got better around them.
*  The East got way better real quickly.
*  The VUCH rule should be, does this guarantee you like moving on a
*  couple of rounds of playoffs?
*  No, it doesn't.
*  The price looks even worse after the fact, but I get what they're trying to do.
*  After they took Jed Howard, I think the press is actually now better.
*  You see you lay out all that, the trade on paper.
*  It's like, ah, they basically traded Franz and Carter for VUCH.
*  Can talk myself into that.
*  I'm trying to think of like the last time, but then it wasn't that long ago.
*  I think Johnny Davis was the most recent.
*  Everybody's like, man, I don't know if I see it.
*  Actually, people probably like Johnny Davis more when he was drafted than they
*  did.
*  Well, it was weird because he had a teammate that everybody seemed to think
*  was better than him.
*  That's all.
*  That was also a weird dynamic.
*  Oh, and Buffett.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  So you took Chicago.
*  The Celts are still on the board and I'm going to take them from a one more time
*  with, with the Jalen contract, which he's going to get, but they won't be able to
*  trade until next July.
*  And you know, it's, it's in the air.
*  I, I sent you the Fandl odds and the Celtics are the favorites to win the title on
*  Fandl plus 460 and Denver's plus 470.
*  I just thought that was outrageous.
*  And may I get it?
*  Maybe the East is, is worse than the West, but Denver to me is the most repeatable
*  champ we've had since the 2017 Warriors.
*  The style of play, the age of the guys and the fact that they're going to be able
*  to so easily add around on the fringes with rotations and all the guys who would
*  want to play on that team.
*  I just, how are they not the favorites?
*  I don't understand it.
*  Yeah, I'm with you on that one.
*  I don't get it.
*  I mean, Bruce Brown's a nice piece, but I mean, that's the thing is as soon as you
*  go in there, you're going to be a better player because of Jokic.
*  You just are.
*  Maybe Brown, maybe Christian Brown will play a lot of those Bruce Brown minutes
*  and actually be pretty good.
*  I really liked Bruce Brown.
*  I valued what he did, but Christian Brown might be ready to do more for that team
*  too.
*  So anyway, with the Celts, they're somehow the favorites, even though they've only
*  made one finals, um, the poor Zingas thing.
*  You know, Zach was saying how the thing that made him nervous about the trade was
*  they were already not a good passing team and they move, they moved their best
*  passer, whether you would call Sparta great passer, I don't know.
*  That's debatable, but he at least would look for other guys and poor Zingas is
*  another, I need the ball guy.
*  And he was just worried about, um, just that piece of it.
*  I'm still so bullish on Derek White from what we saw last year, um, being
*  able to step up and have stuff run through him that I'm not as worried about
*  it, but you know, there's, there's a world where the Celtics season goes sideways.
*  As weird as that sounds, cause they're prohibitive favorites in the East, right?
*  You got Rob and you have poor Zingas, not exactly a Lou Gehrig and AC green
*  from a durability standpoint.
*  Um, you have all of a sudden it's gonna be like Peyton Pritchard it's time.
*  It's a, Brogdon might be ready for the start of the season.
*  Like there, there's some little stuff and then giving Jalen all that money,
*  which they're going to do.
*  What does that mean?
*  So you're going to want to be there.
*  So he's going to want to be there.
*  The Missoula piece.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that that's the year, some of the restrictions that we've been talking
*  about too, like they're not going to take place this season anyway.
*  So, um, okay.
*  You know, it's disappointing.
*  It's disappointing as the Philly series was, cause they should have beaten them.
*  They shouldn't have been down three, two to that team.
*  And then even worse, the Miami team, um, to lose those series.
*  Well, there's the finals last year, the Eastern conference finals this year.
*  Like you go into it being like, Hey, that's still a really good team.
*  I'm with you.
*  I wouldn't make them the favorites over Denver, but I think the statistical
*  models have had a hard on for Boston now for two years.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think Witt Grossbeck, I remember listening to him in a preview of this,
*  up this upcoming past season where he went on NBA radio and he said, Hey,
*  we were a little overrated and the, and the, the host didn't understand what he
*  meant.
*  And what he meant was is that I think five 38 gave the Celtics, like an 87% chance
*  of winning the NBA finals against Golden state.
*  And you know, when you're watching all season long, not to knock everybody's
*  models, because those of us that watch get it wrong, ignoring models are looking
*  at them, but it's like, man, if you're 87% based on your model, those two teams
*  last year, then something's wrong with the model and that's what Wic was talking
*  about.
*  Wic was looking at it, going like we had all of these different projections at
*  times that we were this overwhelming favorite.
*  So the fact that most of those guys are still around, I don't know if Vegas is
*  looking at that and factoring in what the price is, but the models love Boston.
*  And it's, it's not going to be any different for a third year of this with
*  the depth and the guys.
*  Although the defense clearly has fallen off from what they were two years ago.
*  I wouldn't have to be the favorites.
*  I think the only thing that you would say for Denver, which I think is totally
*  fair, and I've said it already way too many times is the regular season profile
*  was not of the team that you think of like Golden state, like you can say that
*  the most dominant since maybe we're in the very beginning of this, maybe this is
*  their 14 or 15 year, you know, 14 wasn't a title year for Golden state.
*  15 felt like they were ahead of schedule.
*  Denver doesn't feel like they're ahead of schedule.
*  Can I go way back with a 77 blazers and then the next year started 50 and 10 in
*  the title.
*  They were actually better the next year.
*  I think that's going to be Denver.
*  I really do.
*  I think they're going to go like 65 wins next year.
*  I think they're going to be awesome.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I really do.
*  I sometimes the title, the disease of more can happen or you can be like, man,
*  we got lucky and then we lost this role guy and that guy, I just think they're
*  top four unless Porter got hurt or there's some sort of injury variable that
*  we don't know about yet.
*  Um, just their style of play and how good Yocage is.
*  I think Yocage is that good.
*  And the history of the league says it, that was the start of something, not the
*  culmination of something.
*  He is that somebody who's that good.
*  Yeah, no, he's that good.
*  And I'm glad it's happened.
*  He feels Tim Duncan ish where it's like, well, if your number one guy is wired
*  that way and all this is real, then you know, you have a better chance of staying
*  in the course as a franchise because it's only like, he couldn't wait to leave
*  America.
*  It's like, Oh, is there parade?
*  Uh, all right.
*  I'll stay.
*  I guess I'll stay for that before I can get out of here.
*  Like to him, it's like, let's go, let's kick everyone's ass.
*  We'll win the title and I'll get out of there.
*  Um, and then he'll come back next year and kick everyone's ass again.
*  Well, you see what's going on with our country politically.
*  Can you blame them?
*  Wait, wait, real quick though, like you're, you're a little too dismissive of it
*  though.
*  I, when I'm talking about Denver and who they were this regular season and how
*  weird the rest of the West was, I think that's part of the pricing there that
*  Vegas is coming up with.
*  I think they agree with me more than you do.
*  Three maybe teams.
*  Then we'll wrap this up.
*  Lakers, Philly and Milwaukee.
*  Cause the Lakers, the one more time thing would be just if LeBron, this is
*  the last year of his deal.
*  And if his son is good enough to come right out of the, uh, at a college and
*  get drafted the first year, I think LeBron is just going to go to whatever
*  team that is the Philly piece.
*  You know, Harris who the Harris trade coverage stuff this week was pretty
*  hilarious, but it looks like they're going to have heart and back that I'm
*  operating under that assumption.
*  And if nothing happens with that team this year, then something will happen.
*  And then I don't know, Milwaukee, it seems like Lopez is leaving.
*  I know we're going to do that next segment with the players, but it just
*  seems like other teams have more money than the bucks do for this.
*  And you know,
*  when horse was on them, when horse was, when he talked about Middleton opting
*  out, he was on TV this week.
*  And now all of us are like, as soon as when horse like leans a certain way,
*  we're like, what does he know?
*  What does he know?
*  And he was, I think it would make sense to any of us to pay attention to stuff.
*  The listeners that are super up on this deal, Middleton opting out may mean
*  nothing, Brooke Lopez.
*  He was like, that might be a little trickier.
*  Well, here's the problem.
*  Brooke Lopez won a ring already.
*  That's the part we always forget with some of these guys.
*  When they, when they have the ring, it's just a different mindset.
*  It's like, I already did it.
*  I already won the title.
*  Now let me get one last awesome contract.
*  And get used in the right team, right situation.
*  So.
