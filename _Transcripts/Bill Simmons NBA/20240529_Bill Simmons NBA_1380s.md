# Bill Waltonâ€™s Unforgettable Basketball Journey | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKZl_af6FPg)
*  So I spent three years writing my basketball book,
*  which got published in October of 2009.
*  And for the epilogue, I wanted to drive down to San Diego
*  and talk to Bill Walton because a big part of the book
*  was about the secret of basketball,
*  how it wasn't about basketball,
*  how it was about being selfless, being a good teammate,
*  about understanding your place in the hierarchy of a team,
*  about great players who can make other players better.
*  Bill Walton embodied so much of it
*  that I felt like I had to go see him.
*  And there was this extra piece
*  that of all the great players ever,
*  he was the one guy who had that gift
*  and wasn't really able to use it
*  because he kept getting hurt.
*  So I drove to San Diego,
*  and I'm just gonna read you the first two paragraphs
*  of the epilogue.
*  William Theodore Walton III lives in a sprawling house
*  filled with hundreds of books, pictures, mementos,
*  artifacts, and everything else
*  that should definitely be in Bill Walton's house.
*  Turn left and you might see a Vietnam book
*  next to a Hunter S. Thompson book.
*  Turn right and you might see a photo of Bill and Bob Dylan
*  hanging next to a picture of Bill and John Wooden.
*  A lifelong resident of the most beautiful city in America,
*  Walton owns a Spanish-style home that makes you think,
*  I am definitely undoubtedly in San Diego right now.
*  The house features a basketball half court and a pool,
*  as well as his lovely wife, Lori,
*  two pooches named Annie and Shasta,
*  and a black cat named Charcoal.
*  That's right, a black cat.
*  This blows me away.
*  Bill Walton seems like the last guy
*  who should tempt fate with a black cat.
*  Instead of being mentioned in the same breath
*  with Russell and Wilton Kareem,
*  he's remembered for bad luck in what could have been.
*  His body continues to pay for an injury riddled career
*  that ended 22 years ago.
*  Only recently could he start moving around
*  after major back surgery left him bedridden for months.
*  His feet portrayed him so egregiously
*  that within 10 minutes of sitting down with him,
*  I glance at his swollen, scarred,
*  almost unrecognizable right foot,
*  become distracted, and lose my train of thought.
*  Walton was blessed with a gift
*  and cursed with a body that couldn't handle that gift.
*  The curse trumped the gift.
*  One of the few players who understood the secret
*  completely and totally,
*  poor Walton never had an extended chance to harvest it.
*  When I think back to that day, it's 15 years ago,
*  almost to the month,
*  I keep thinking about his foot,
*  because you looked at it and it was like looking at a suitcase
*  that had stickers from where everybody went,
*  and it just had all these scarves
*  that just kind of captured how awful his journey was,
*  just trying to stay in the court.
*  I think he had probably 40 foot surgeries
*  and back surgeries, and his body just couldn't hold up,
*  but he was at peace with it by the time I saw him play,
*  and I have a lot more in that.
*  I want to go backwards though,
*  because everyone talked about
*  what an amazing human being he was
*  and what an ambassador he was for basketball,
*  but there was some basic basketball stuff
*  I just wanted to rip through really quick about Walton,
*  because I feel like he was that important.
*  He's one of the greatest college basketball players ever
*  by any calculation, that's the first thing.
*  Three player of the year awards, two titles,
*  they had an 88 game winning streak at UCLA,
*  in the 72 final for 57 points, 41 rebounds in the two games,
*  in 73 in the championship game against Memphis,
*  best game ever, 21 for 22 field goal, Jesus.
*  44 points, 13 rebounds,
*  and if you're going to talk about
*  who are the greatest college basketball players of all time,
*  Lou Alcindor, Bill Walton, Maravich, Oscar,
*  whatever list you want to make,
*  Alcindor and Walton have to be the first two on it,
*  and that's that.
*  So he comes into the league,
*  he's the first pick in the draft for Portland,
*  and can't really stay healthy there for a couple years,
*  and then all of a sudden it happens.
*  March 1977 through February 78,
*  the Blazers go 70 and 15, including the 1977 playoffs,
*  and Walton's just crushing it in the playoffs.
*  He's like 18 and 16 and six assists,
*  three plus blocks a game.
*  He beats Artis Gilmore, David Thompson,
*  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Dr. J in the finals,
*  and then this is the third thing, in the finals,
*  he has one of the 10 greatest closing games
*  in the history of the finals.
*  Pettit's game six in 57, Russell's game seven in 62,
*  Jordan's game six in 98,
*  Frazier's game seven in 70,
*  Magic's game six in 80,
*  Bird's game six in 86,
*  Duncan's game six in 03,
*  LeBron's game seven in 16,
*  Giannis' 50 pointer in 21,
*  and then Bill Walton, 20 points, 23 rebounds,
*  eight assists, seven blocks,
*  they win the game in the final play,
*  he rips off his jersey,
*  celebrates short list with the delirious Portland fans.
*  There's, maybe it's the greatest of all the closing games.
*  I gotta say, when you throw in the crowd coming in
*  and just mobbing them, it's pretty great.
*  Another thing with him,
*  he's the greatest passing center ever
*  until Jokic shows up.
*  So if you're gonna do Mount Passmore,
*  it's Bill Russell, Sabonis, Jokic, and Bill Walton.
*  If you're gonna do most fun teammates of all time,
*  I don't know how long you want your list to be,
*  but Bird, and Magic, and Bill Walton, and Jokic
*  have to be probably the first four people mentioned.
*  So there's that.
*  The fifth thing, as he's doing all of this,
*  he's one of the great off the court characters
*  in the history of the league.
*  He's got the long hair with the ponytail,
*  he's got the beard,
*  he's doing 70s protest stuff in a league
*  that for the most part wanted no part of this stuff.
*  He's not just protesting Vietnam,
*  he's sticking up for black players,
*  he's sticking up for civil rights.
*  He is a true 70s radical.
*  There wasn't only no other NBA player like this
*  in the 70s, there were barely any athletes like this
*  in the 70s.
*  Because Ali, Brown, Kareem, all those guys
*  who in the 60s made such an impact.
*  By the 70s it's starting to fade a little bit,
*  and Walton's keeping it going.
*  He's also a pot smoker, he's a vegan,
*  rides his bike everywhere.
*  Brent Musburger nicknames it the Mountain Man.
*  He had this stuttering problem back then
*  that somehow not only did he overcome,
*  he became an eventual broadcaster,
*  but he was just a presence.
*  He's seven foot two, like legitimately.
*  I know he was listed at 6'11",
*  but he was a legitimate seven foot two.
*  Long, crazy hair, played unlike anyone else in the league,
*  was the only person who made Kareem seem smaller.
*  So on top of that, he had this unabashed love
*  for John Wooden and for good basketball.
*  He had this crazy spiritual connection
*  with the Grateful Dead, which lasted all the way through
*  when he played, then afterwards,
*  and I think he was still showing up for shows
*  even in the last year.
*  In the 90s he ends up doing broadcasting
*  and becomes a character that way.
*  This was the era where the color guy
*  really was never that interesting in basketball.
*  And then Walton comes in, he's killing Karl Malone,
*  he's killing coaches, he's doing stuff
*  almost from a fan's perspective,
*  but he had the gravitas to do it,
*  because he was Bill Walton,
*  and he would have these fun podcast interviews
*  and all these different things.
*  You saw a lot of that in 30 for 30,
*  but he was a true, true, true off the court character
*  on top of being such a great player.
*  The sixth thing, he's the best guy
*  in one of the four best teams I ever saw in person.
*  So I saw them in December 77, they played in Boston.
*  I just turned eight years old,
*  and for me to remember a random Celtics game
*  from December 77 means that it had to have left
*  an impact on me because the Celtics sucked that year.
*  The Salvagecs last year, they were not a playoff team.
*  Portland shows up, kicks the crap out of us.
*  They reach a level that I'd never seen in person before
*  where they're just, we would miss,
*  Walton would get the rebound, everybody would take off.
*  And that's just how it went.
*  They felt unbeatable, we missed, they scored,
*  we missed, they scored.
*  They felt like watching a machine.
*  We left the garden, I remember my dad and I just like,
*  oh my God, we would never have a chance against that team.
*  And as I got older, I thought the score was like 160 to 70.
*  The score was actually 117 to 86,
*  but I wrote this when I wrote my book,
*  and I still feel this way.
*  The 86 Celtics, the 96 Bulls, and that 77 Blazers
*  are the three best teams I've ever seen in person.
*  And since I wrote the book, I would add the 2017 Warriors.
*  So it'd be those four teams.
*  I never got to see the 2013 Heat during the streak
*  because I was doing TV that year,
*  but I wish I had seen them
*  because I feel like they would have been in there.
*  But those are my four, 86 Celtics, 96 Bulls,
*  77 Blazers, 2017 Warriors, just for me seeing them in person.
*  The seventh thing about Walton, his injuries
*  and his loss of relevance from 1978 to 1985
*  was one of the most damaging things
*  that ever happened in the NBA.
*  It's that simple.
*  It starts with, he gets hurt in February.
*  They misdiagnose it.
*  He has a stress fracture, which they don't really realize.
*  He ends up coming back for the playoffs.
*  They think he has a sore foot.
*  They shoot his foot up.
*  He makes it way worse.
*  We end up in a malpractice situation
*  where he sues the team.
*  He misses the whole next season,
*  ends up signing with the Clippers, and that's a disaster.
*  He misses three full seasons
*  from the moment that injury happens.
*  He plays 47 games in five years at one point,
*  47 games total.
*  For the Clippers, he played less than I think 175 games.
*  And just gets removed from the league for seven years,
*  basically, because even when he was playing in the Clippers,
*  and he had a couple years, he played like 55 games,
*  65 games, but even on the Clippers,
*  it's not like anybody was watching them.
*  They weren't a playoff team.
*  So not only did we lose Walton,
*  so think about if we just lost Jokic four years ago,
*  he's just gone.
*  What's the league like?
*  I hope Lazers, Lakers, and Walton Kareem robbery
*  just never happens.
*  We have him in the 77 playoffs, he beats Kareem,
*  and then it just never happens again.
*  We lose Walton versus Moses.
*  We lose Walton playing against the Bird Celtics.
*  We lose Walton from a stretch of the NBA
*  that was really dangerous.
*  The 78 playoffs, 79 playoffs, that whole season,
*  the cocaine era is setting it in.
*  The best players in the league are Dr. J and Kareem.
*  They're not on TV that much.
*  They really kind of need Walton.
*  He's one of the most famous guys in the league,
*  and his team is the most fun team to watch,
*  and he's just gone.
*  And right around then, they start tape delaying games.
*  They're not showing games at all.
*  They don't know which stars to push,
*  because they had David Thompson, they had Ice,
*  they had Gerven, they had good players,
*  but for whatever reason, Walton,
*  because of that 77 finals,
*  it felt like he was becoming the face of the league,
*  and then he's just gone.
*  And they weren't really able to replace him
*  until Bird of Magic showed up.
*  Basketball dies in San Diego is another thing that happened.
*  I wrote at the time,
*  you can't overstate how damaging those lost Walton years were
*  for anyone who truly cared about basketball.
*  From a comedy standpoint, it would be like Eddie Murphy
*  releasing 48 hours and trading places,
*  disappearing for the next eight years,
*  coming back, releasing Beverly Hills Cop,
*  and then disappearing for good.
*  That's what it was like.
*  I mean, you're talking,
*  we should have had 1,100 games from him,
*  plus 150 playoff games,
*  and we end up with less than 500 regular season games,
*  less than 50 playoff games.
*  So there's that.
*  Number eight, he was the focal point
*  of the best sports book of all time by David Halberstam.
*  It's called Breaks of the Game.
*  It is a 362 page snapshot of the NBA reds.
*  It's shifting from this downtrodden era it was having
*  to a pretty lucrative era.
*  It covers the 79, 80 season, but it goes backwards.
*  It's through Portland, through the prism of this team
*  that it really meant something
*  that had a chance to be truly great.
*  And then within two years, Walton's gone.
*  Injuries, money has ruined the team,
*  people are getting traded, and it's about a loss of loyalty.
*  It's about bigger business stakes.
*  It's about the rise of the personal brand,
*  smarter media coverage, trusting your doctors.
*  It's just an amazing book and an amazing character study.
*  I wrote about it for page two 20 years ago.
*  I read that book so many times,
*  I felt like the guys in the book were my friends,
*  including Bill Walton.
*  But one of my favorite parts of the book
*  was Bobby Knight calls Stu Inman, the guy who built the team.
*  And this was right after Walton bolted for San Diego.
*  And Knight was so crushed because he loved the Blazers.
*  He felt like Walton's Blazers teams were like exactly
*  the kind of basketball he wanted in life.
*  And he asked Stu Inman,
*  is there any way to keep a perfect team together?
*  Can it be done anymore?
*  And that's been the crucial question of following basketball
*  for the last 50 years, starting with the 77 Blazers.
*  Can you build a perfect team?
*  Can you keep the team together?
*  The answer is probably no.
*  I mean, even like we had the 2017 Warriors,
*  which were about as perfect of an offensive team
*  as you can ever build them within two years,
*  Katie's leaving.
*  We had Jordan in the Bulls,
*  and Jordan after three titles goes to play baseball,
*  comes back three more titles, that falls apart.
*  Injuries, money, jealousy, it's just too freaking hard.
*  And it really starts with that 77 Blazers team.
*  The Knight thing, he becomes the most overqualified
*  six main of all time.
*  He goes to the Celtics, they trade Cedric Maxwell for him.
*  I think they traded a pick too.
*  Goes to the 1986 Celtics, Bird's Apex.
*  They go 82 and 18, they go 50 and one at home,
*  and miraculously, Bill Walton plays 80 games
*  and 16 playoff games.
*  He plays 96 games.
*  This is a guy who did not play 500 regular season games
*  in his career.
*  His previous career, I was 67, played 19 minutes a game,
*  he was eight, seven, and two,
*  and brought just something to that team
*  that I can't even describe.
*  He clicked with Bird in a way
*  that was almost hard to believe as you were watching it.
*  They were just immediately on the same wifi link,
*  and they would start messing around with each other
*  during games, and they had the same play over and over again
*  where Bird would throw it to Walton,
*  and then he would run toward Walton,
*  almost like using Walton as a pick,
*  and either pretend to dart out for three,
*  or he would just cut to the basket,
*  and Walton would wait and just whip it over his head
*  and find him.
*  But watching those guys experiment together
*  was about as happy as I've ever been as a basketball fan.
*  The team had so much size.
*  The team really loved each other and pulled for each other.
*  There was no jealousy at all.
*  And for Walton, this guy who had seemed like,
*  was this huge what if in so many different ways,
*  and then basketball makes him happy again.
*  He fits in that team and plays for what seems
*  to be the greatest team ever at the time.
*  And he loved Larry Bird the most.
*  There's this great moment, you can find it on YouTube,
*  game four Eastern Conference Finals, 86.
*  They're playing in Milwaukee,
*  and they're getting revenge against Milwaukee
*  because Milwaukee swept them three years earlier.
*  And Bird, ball gets swung around.
*  It's literally the last couple seconds of the game,
*  and Bird says, screw it,
*  and just shoots a three at the buzzer.
*  And it's an F-U-3 exclamation point, goes in,
*  and you see Walton on the court.
*  He raises his arms.
*  He's so pumped.
*  Just can't believe Bird took the shot and made it.
*  And CBS follows them into the locker room,
*  and they're getting the celebration,
*  and people are like, yeah, we did it.
*  And then Walton comes in last, and he's like,
*  Larry Bird, Larry Bird.
*  It's just saying Larry Bird over and over and over again.
*  He was so delighted by Bird,
*  but he was such a big part of that team.
*  And I can't think of another six man quite like him
*  that could come in, swing games,
*  where you weren't even sure maybe he should just be
*  in crunch time in every game.
*  He was that good.
*  And he would come in, huge, huge, huge body.
*  Always had the ball over his head.
*  Fundamentally, he was so good.
*  He would get these rebounds,
*  just keep the ball over his head.
*  Nobody does this anymore.
*  Or if they do it, you notice it.
*  He was always ready to make a play at all times,
*  which I think is a weird thing to praise somebody for,
*  but there's so many guys now who get the ball,
*  they're like, what am I gonna do?
*  Walton always knew what he was gonna do.
*  I feel like his tape should be shown
*  to high school centers for the rest of eternity.
*  Last thing, I think Walton was one of 15 or 16 players
*  who guaranteed you a title if he was healthy.
*  And here's what I mean by that,
*  because when I was figuring out the pyramid for my book,
*  the question for me trying to do the rankings is,
*  you know, I'll do respect to David Robinson,
*  but would you rather have 14 years of David Robinson
*  or like three years of Bill Walton?
*  Because if I have three years of Bill Walton,
*  and I can put the right team around him,
*  a good rebounder next to him,
*  and a couple shooters and some quick guards,
*  am I winning the title?
*  Like I probably am.
*  And if I want a great player,
*  I want them because I wanna win a title.
*  It's not, I just don't wanna be good for a decade and a half.
*  I wanna win the title.
*  Not that many players guaranteed you a title.
*  Like when I did this list of my book,
*  it was Jordan Bird, Magic, Russell, Hakim, Kareem, Duncan,
*  Shaq, Moses, Wilt, and Mike in the 50s.
*  Now it's the whole list.
*  Winston, Kobe, LeBron, Jokic, Curry.
*  Maybe Giannis, depends how you feel about 2021
*  and all the stuff that happened this year.
*  It was a pretty weird year.
*  I'm not positive Giannis guarantees you a title,
*  but he's, couldn't be closer.
*  And then Luca would be the last one.
*  Maybe that's on that list.
*  But that's how good Walton was.
*  That's why even though he didn't play that long,
*  we were talking about him for years and decades after.
*  And then, you know, the really special piece
*  was he brought as much joy and appreciation and wisdom
*  to his post-playing career as I think any great player ever.
*  So when I drove to San Diego to see him,
*  and I'm thinking of the premise,
*  the secret of basketball is that it's not about basketball,
*  and I lay it out for him.
*  I have the whole Isaiah story
*  about how Isaiah realized what the secret was
*  that I have in my book.
*  I have a few other examples.
*  I gave him my case basically for the secret.
*  And he listened to me, and this is what he said.
*  It's not a secret as much as a choice.
*  Look at the forces fighting against that choice.
*  Look at the forces pushing you to make the other choice,
*  the wrong choice.
*  It's all about you.
*  It's all about material acquisitions,
*  physical gratification, stats, and highlights.
*  Everywhere you go, you're bombarded
*  with the opposite message of what really matters.
*  And you wouldn't even know otherwise
*  unless you played with the right player or right coach,
*  the Woodens, the Arbacks, the Ramses, the Russles,
*  the Birds.
*  How many people get that lucky?
*  Kobe was blessed to have Phil and eventually realized that.
*  With a truly great coach, it's not about a diagram,
*  it's not about a play, it's not about a practice.
*  It's the course of time over history.
*  It's the impact a coach has on the lives around him.
*  That's what Phil has done for Kobe.
*  The history of life is that most people figure it out.
*  Most of the time, it's too late.
*  That's the real frustrating part,
*  the squandered opportunities that you can't get back.
*  Kobe figured it out.
*  It took a while, but he figured it out.
*  Now, he says all this, this was right after the 2009 finals.
*  And one of the things I was grappling with in my book
*  was Kobe just won the finals.
*  I wouldn't say Kobe is on the first sentence
*  of people I would say was a big secret guy.
*  You know, he was a new generation of player
*  where it was like, he's gonna get his
*  and you had to fit everyone around him,
*  but you could still win a title that way.
*  And it took me a while to figure out
*  the type of basketball that I cared about
*  versus the type of basketball that Kobe was good at.
*  I couldn't reconcile the two.
*  I was like, whatever Kobe is doing on this Lakers team,
*  it feels opposite to the stuff
*  I'm basically touting in this book.
*  So what does that mean for the book?
*  And that was what I went to Walton with.
*  And this is what Walton said back.
*  Kobe only wants to win.
*  It doesn't matter what your motivation is
*  or that your game or your style is different
*  or that it's not perceived to be right or acceptable.
*  We've seen an entire spectrum of things
*  for him this decade and right now he's really, really good.
*  Look, you want him to be perfect for you.
*  This comes back to your choice, who your heroes are.
*  You chose to value a certain type of player
*  over anyone else.
*  He has the right to make his choice too.
*  So that's what Bill Walton said and he was exactly right.
*  Kobe was choosing to play a certain way and it worked.
*  Got to hand it to him.
*  But that wasn't the best thing I took away
*  from my time with Walton.
*  Cause we were talking about
*  not just the secret of basketball,
*  but when it becomes truly special
*  when we talk about Larry Bird and this is what he said.
*  It all starts with the flow.
*  Throw in the performance aspect
*  and that's when you really have something.
*  Larry played with passion, persistence and purpose.
*  There was meaning to his performances.
*  Same for Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Jerry Garcia, Jordan, Magic.
*  It was important to them, which made it important to us.
*  The personality of the lead player brings with it
*  all kinds of responsibilities.
*  Not just a job, it's a way of life.
*  With Larry, people would buy tickets
*  where they couldn't even see the game.
*  Obstructed seats just to be there.
*  People just wanted to be in the arena
*  and feel that golden glow.
*  He was incomparable.
*  He could do things that nobody else
*  could even think of doing
*  and he would do them in the biggest moments
*  on the grandest stages.
*  That's control of the flow.
*  Flow plus meaning equals performance.
*  So that's what Bill Walton said.
*  I thought it was one of the coolest things
*  I'd ever heard anybody say, at least to me.
*  And I think he's right.
*  Flow plus meaning equals performance.
*  And the crazy thing about it was
*  nobody understood that as a player more than Bill Walton.
*  Because if you saw him at his peak in 77,
*  there was flow and there was meaning
*  and there was performance and there was a connection
*  with his teammates that was unlike anything else
*  that was happening.
*  And it got taken away from him.
*  And a lot of times that can break somebody.
*  And it didn't break him.
*  He was able to rise above it and he led a great life
*  and affected a lot of people.
*  And to the end, he had flow and he had meaning
*  and he had performance.
*  So RIP Bill Walton.
*  He died this week at 71 years old.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  The sport of basketball is gonna miss him.
*  And we're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
*  We're gonna miss him.
