# What Does the Lakers Sale Mean? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y)
*  Well, it was the most interesting thing that's happened since the last time I've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  talked to you and I haven't talked to Rob this whole finals. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=3.2s)]
*  Just something that had been rumored for a while. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=6.48s)]
*  And especially after Mark Walter bought the 27% in 2021 and he had the hammer, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=10.16s)]
*  if they ever tried to sell. And it was like, well, if they ever sell, it's going to be to this guy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=14.88s)]
*  And then the Celtic sale sale happens. And it's like, Hmm. There had been some buzz. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=18.56s)]
*  And then out of nowhere it happened. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=25.2s)]
*  And I don't not positive. It was out of nowhere because there had been some, some rumblings, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=26.72s)]
*  but you know, for what, given the fact that he had the big stake already, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=32.56s)]
*  and then the bus family kept 18%. So he only had to buy another 48% to get that majority stake. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=37.36s)]
*  So he slapped down the 4.8 billion. It seems like it's 10, but it's half that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  It's still like a crazy amount of money for a team that doesn't own an arena. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  And I had the same reaction with the Celtics. Like even though I knew the number was going to be the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=52.0s)]
*  number, I'm still like kind of staggered. They have a lease that goes through staple center until [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=55.92s)]
*  2041. I think the rest of the league, and you're already seeing stuff that being mentioned and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=60.24s)]
*  written about the Lakers notoriously really frugal for a team that was the signature franchise in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  league. There were millions of stories. They are but a mom and pop franchise bill. Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=71.2s)]
*  They're being run like the local drug store in Pasadena. And meanwhile, they're the biggest [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=76.16s)]
*  drug store in America. And people are wondering, well, what if that changes? What does that mean? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=81.04s)]
*  I still feel like they were spending a lot of money, Rob. It's not like they were [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  cheap and out of luxury tax, but it will be interesting to see if what this group was able [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  to do with the Dodgers professionalizes the Lakers in the same way, what that's going to mean. I [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=96.72s)]
*  think it's pretty scary. Yeah. I think they're spending a lot of money and then there's caution [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  to the wind level money. There is, we're just going to try to blow this thing over the top, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  and that can get you, as the Phoenix Suns can attest, into some really deep water sometimes, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=110.56s)]
*  take you to some really dark places as a franchise. I think there is the Lakers element of the story, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=114.72s)]
*  and then there is the larger, like, there is a whole class of NBA owners and governors who are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=119.36s)]
*  now selling and migrating out of that business. I think some of that is just those valuation numbers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=124.72s)]
*  going up and up and up to a point where you just can't say no anymore, realistically, to something [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=129.6s)]
*  like that. But it's just something that a lot of people are getting out of the NBA owning business, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=133.68s)]
*  that this is the time that they have selected to say Lakers, Celtics, Mavericks, Hornets, who else [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=138.32s)]
*  has sold recently? I mean, the Wolves has given a kind of protracted process. The Suns, of course. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=144.4s)]
*  I've heard this argument, and I think if you go case by case, each one actually makes sense [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=149.76s)]
*  individually and doesn't seem like part of a larger trend. Like the Celtics one, Wick's dad [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  wanted to sell, and he owned the biggest chunk of the team, and he's hitting his 90s, and he wanted [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=160.0s)]
*  to get his estate in order, and that was it. They won the title, he won it out. The Mavericks thing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=164.56s)]
*  was super weird for a bunch of reasons. They had a bunch of organizational stuff going on. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=170.08s)]
*  Mark Cuban might want to run for president. I don't know if that was, and I want to get ahead of this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=174.8s)]
*  whole media rights thing, this is the perfect time. I actually think he probably would have been better [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=181.28s)]
*  off holding on for a year or two more. Timberlip's thing, the guy regretted it the moment he agreed [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=185.44s)]
*  to the deal. He was trying to get out of it for three years. The Suns, they made Sarver sell. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=190.48s)]
*  So this is the first one where- What about Portland's in that group too? Although that's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  been another kind of long gestating process. Yeah, that was like a family. The guy died and left it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=201.92s)]
*  to the family. I think when you have a lot of siblings and a family, and siblings getting older, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=207.12s)]
*  and they start thinking about the estate tax stuff, I think it does change. They look at it, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=212.72s)]
*  and like, Hey, we can cash in now. We split all the money and there's ways to do it. But this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=217.44s)]
*  episode is presented by State Farm. It's no secret that great teams need great teammates. I've been [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=222.48s)]
*  saying this for years. And when it comes to insurance, State Farm is there to help you find [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=227.6s)]
*  the right coverage for your home, car, and more. Whether you need an in-person or digital assist, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=231.2s)]
*  they're ready when life hits you with a full court press. Get a game plan that helps fit your life. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=236.72s)]
*  Talk to State Farm today. State Farm with the assist. Coverage options are selected by the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=242.72s)]
*  customer availability and the eligibility vary by state. Zach, you think going forward with the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Dodgers owning the Lakers basically, and Luka Doncic in there, this is a pretty safe bet to be [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  a dominant franchise now, I would say for the next 10 years, because they've proven they can do this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=261.84s)]
*  with the Dodgers. Well, I mean, people are going to laugh at the idea that, you know, what do the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=265.68s)]
*  Lakers need more? I mean, they're the Lakers. There's a reason Laker exceptionalism. Stars just [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=271.6s)]
*  fall into their lap all the time. Like they already had this baked in advantage. And the NBA is not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=276.16s)]
*  baseball. You can't spend on payroll infinitely. There's a cap and a hardish cap. It's not baseball. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  You can spend on all the other stuff, which is like something Ballmer is doing right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=290.24s)]
*  That's the point is all of this stuff that the Lakers have not spent on commensurate with their [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=294.88s)]
*  place in the market, whether it's analytics, scouting, video, all the fancy stuff. Like it's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=300.32s)]
*  cute to make fun of that. Like, oh, is that really going to help the Lakers? Like the Lakers need [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=306.88s)]
*  help? Is it really going to help on the fringes of the roster? Because they'll miss on a lot of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=310.64s)]
*  those moves on the fringes of the roster. But the point is like over time, if you set yourself up [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=315.84s)]
*  to just make better decisions on roster spots, five to 15 over 10, 20, 30 years, you will in the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=320.96s)]
*  aggregate make better decisions on roster spots, five to 15. And that is where all the spending, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=329.04s)]
*  I think, will matter. And there's just, I think it's super, I think it's super interesting. I [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=335.04s)]
*  just think the bus family game of Thrones thing is really interesting. I think the bus like, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=339.12s)]
*  like Jerry bus, obviously he's been passed away for a while, but that class of owner is, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  is leaving. And you talked about people getting out of the NBA business. These prices are like, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  there's only so many people that can even get into the NBA business right now. Even to buy like [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=356.96s)]
*  5% of these teams is an enormous amount of money. And it just is going to open the door for like, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  what kind of funds are going to get more involved? Are we moving more in that direction? Because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  we're just running, you can only go to Larry Ellison so many times and be like, Hey, you want [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=370.56s)]
*  8 billion? You want a team? Like there's just not many of those people. Yeah. And it seems, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=375.28s)]
*  oh, go ahead, Rob. I was gonna say it feels telling, you know, like the Lakers are in their [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=380.32s)]
*  own classes. We've decided or discussed in terms of what their appeal is to players and what their [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=383.36s)]
*  place is in the league. Like they are a unique case, but we're coming off a week in which [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  Desmond Baines showed up at the, at the practice facility in Orlando was like, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=392.16s)]
*  this isn't what it's like in Memphis. And coming off a week in which there was a clip of Dejante [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=396.64s)]
*  Murray going around talking about how he couldn't even get time on the training table in New Orleans. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=400.64s)]
*  The Pelicans are like a whole separate thing. But all of which is to say there is lots of room [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  on the margins to do things that are meaningful to your bottom line as an organization, are [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=412.08s)]
*  meaningful to players, are meaningful to your success as a franchise that are right there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=416.56s)]
*  Like spending on training facilities, spending on a practice facility, spending on assistant coaches, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=420.4s)]
*  spending on analytics, like all of that stuff is within any owner's theoretical grasp if they [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=424.96s)]
*  would care to do it. And everyone pinches pennies somewhere and tightens the bell buckle somewhere [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=430.0s)]
*  else. But like that stuff is right there for the taking for any owner who wants to do it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And I think I feel comfortable saying this. I think they succeeded the last 20 years, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=439.12s)]
*  despite the ownership situation, the Lakers. I also think I really do. I feel like, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=445.44s)]
*  well, was it all the litigation and like, well, if LeBron doesn't decide in 2008, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=451.12s)]
*  you know, 2017 range, I'm going to go to the Lakers. I want to move all my operations there. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=458.32s)]
*  They're just a mess. Like any other team, they would have had all these weird lottery picks. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  They would have to try to figure out how, you know, they pick second three years in a row. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=467.6s)]
*  Then they traded all the rest of their picks for Anthony Davis. Like I feel like they succeeded [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  despite the ownership situation. Now, granted, they just made one of the best trades in the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  history of professional sports, so you can't criticize it too much. But I'm just saying like [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=481.36s)]
*  what the Dodgers have done and what that ownership group has done for that team. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  If they can figure out how to do something similar in basketball and the same kind of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=490.72s)]
*  advantages, Zach, I just feel like this is going to be different. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  Not only a couple of things on what you just said. I think because LeBron went there [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  and then LeBron's agents basically got Anthony Davis to join him there. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=504.24s)]
*  The whole like five or six straight years when they were out of the playoffs and a total disaster [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=511.84s)]
*  and the Nick Young, DeAngelo Russell like thing happened and all of that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=517.36s)]
*  The Kobe extension. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=522.64s)]
*  That was a long time. That was like a Charlotte Hornets, Sacramento Kings stretch of like, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=523.8399999999999s)]
*  what the hell is going on here? This is like 27, 35 win seasons. And there was no guarantee [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLAs5cV_W2Y&t=529.12s)]
