# A 2024 NBA Redraft, Plus 2020s Sliding Doors With Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM)
*  We are taping at 11 a.m. PT. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to do some 2020 sliding doors. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3.44s)]
*  I also wanted to tell you about the Bulls Lakers game I went to last night. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6.42s)]
*  Did you happen to see any minutes of that game? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=9.84s)]
*  Yeah, I watched the entire second half. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=12.08s)]
*  So the Bulls, first of all, are turning into a very belatedly fun end of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=15.08s)]
*  season league pass team because they kind of know who they are and they play [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=21.8s)]
*  really fast and they have two good guards that attack, attack, attack. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=25.04s)]
*  And you could tell pretty early, this wasn't going to be the Lakers night with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  the way, how hard the Bulls were playing and how much they were attacking the rim. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=32.2s)]
*  They're all setting threes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=35.04s)]
*  Um, it did make me wonder if there was a little bit of a blueprint in there to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=36.56s)]
*  beat this Lakers team with go, go, go, keep pushing, keep pushing, keep attacking. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=40.4s)]
*  They don't really have a rim protector. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=46.64s)]
*  They don't really want to run up and down. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=47.96s)]
*  They want to slow things down. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=49.64s)]
*  And I was trying to think of anyone else in the West that could basically replicate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=51.4s)]
*  that and it's obviously okay. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=56.6s)]
*  And it may be last night and I don't know if it's over reaction or not, but [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=58.28s)]
*  last night made me really think like, I think, I think they would be in a heap [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=61.36s)]
*  of trouble in an okay. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  See series with the athletes and the speed and I'm not positive they can match it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=67.88s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=73.44s)]
*  Um, the Bulls were incredible last night. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=74.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=76.44s)]
*  And the Lakers defense is terrible, but it's the first bat or first came back [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=76.8s)]
*  with LeBron those games when he was out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=80.12s)]
*  You know, their net rating was negative. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=83.16s)]
*  Their offense was 21st or defense was 19th. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=84.36s)]
*  They still went three and four. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=86.44s)]
*  I believe is the record. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=88.04s)]
*  Uh, but that was like an all time game. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=89.56s)]
*  I mean, Bezellas is so much fun. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=91.6s)]
*  That baseline movie had on Luca was, was awesome. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=93.08s)]
*  I'm giddy was close to a quadruple double the first one since David Robinson. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=96.56s)]
*  They kept him in near the end. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=101.6s)]
*  We were driving home and they were like, they're keeping giddy in, in case he can [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=103.2s)]
*  get two more steals, he was like, whoa, he was giddy was incredible. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=107.12s)]
*  And by the way, let's take a victory lap. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=111.12s)]
*  We were like the only two people in America who liked that trade for the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  bulls last summer. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=117.28s)]
*  So I'm victory lapping that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=118.24s)]
*  And by the way, I have the people scouting tracks for the scoot victory [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=119.56s)]
*  lap near the end of the season and improbable. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=123.6s)]
*  I'd given up, but we both never sold our stock and now I'm ready to run around [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=126.8s)]
*  the track and wave to our fans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=131.32s)]
*  I'm not ready for that one yet. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=133.2s)]
*  Cause I think we liked him so much. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=134.64s)]
*  It was on the path to stardom, but yeah, it's pretty clear. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=136.72s)]
*  He's not going to be the worst player that plays minutes in the NBA. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=140.16s)]
*  And he might stick around for a little while. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=143.24s)]
*  Sounds like a victory left for both of us. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=144.72s)]
*  Anyway, man watching the Lakers broadcast is really funny. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=146.2s)]
*  Cause you would've thought the bulls like were the two seed in the East. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=150.76s)]
*  And when Patrick Williams comes off a curl on the right side and hit that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=153.32s)]
*  three of all people, you're like, okay. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=156.2s)]
*  I mean, Chicago is just rolling. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=157.88s)]
*  So back to your blueprint thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  You might be right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=160.6s)]
*  You might be right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  I think when the Lakers went. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  What 18 and three and their defense was like a top three or four defense in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  NBA, I was like, are they really this good? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  And now that they're leaking a bit defensively LeBron in and out of it, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=171.56s)]
*  you know, like now that he's back, let's judge them based on this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=175.52s)]
*  I always find this time of year, these last 10 to 12 games, this closing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=178.52s)]
*  stretch of the season, I don't want to say all of it is irrelevant, but I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=182.24s)]
*  really feel like this is the time of the year where you can get tricked and it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=186.24s)]
*  can be really misleading and there can be just effort nights and whether it was [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=189.4s)]
*  that San Antonio Knicks game a couple nights ago where mom insane and the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=193.36s)]
*  Knicks were trying, like you kept watching that game being like, all right, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=198.68s)]
*  enough of this, like the Knicks are going to put together a run and then [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=200.96s)]
*  they're going to figure it out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=203.24s)]
*  You have Cleveland who's lost four in a row, which I don't know if we'll get to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  that with some of the Mitchell stuff. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  So we will continue on the, on the blueprint because I mean, is okay. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=208.2s)]
*  See the blueprint to the Lakers or they just a lot better than the Lakers. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=213.16s)]
*  Well, that's the thing I, but I do think there's people in the NBA and I've [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  certainly considered the case that if you're going to beat, okay, see, it would [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=220.4s)]
*  have to be with a pretty weird, different type of team that has a lot of, you know, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=223.76s)]
*  guys who have been in big situations and then a big physical hard team to play [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=229.88s)]
*  with multiple scoring options would be the case for LA against. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  See, okay. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=237.76s)]
*  See, has it been there? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=238.32s)]
*  LA is not going to be afraid to be on the road. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=239.8s)]
*  Um, what I saw last night, you can really use the defaults of, of Luca and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=242.04s)]
*  40 year old LeBron against them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  And LeBron actually was trying harder than Luca and he was trying to chase [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  down blocks, um, Luca he'll, he can get carried away with the refs and yesterday [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=253.6s)]
*  great last night. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=259.28s)]
*  He looked fast. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=260.44s)]
*  There was that stretch before the two threes that made it a 23 point game when [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=261.35999999999996s)]
*  JJ just was like, all right, enough of this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=264.52s)]
*  There was a stretch where LeBron was actually like, I was watching for that to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=266.88s)]
*  be like, if he's just going to, Hey, I'm going to get some cardio in there was a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=269.76s)]
*  stretch where you could tell on that one drive before it got to 23 points. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=272.79999999999995s)]
*  It was like, okay, he still thinks they have a chance in this thing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=275.96s)]
*  No question. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=278.4s)]
*  I thought he looked great and was playing hard. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=279.0s)]
*  Um, but yeah, they, I think if you keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  they're going to start to bend a little bit because they don't want to play that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  way. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=287.76s)]
*  Um, and the other thing they did was they pressured Luca, which I don't understand [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  why teams don't do this against the Lakers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=292.32s)]
*  I don't understand why they don't do it against Boston with Tatum. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=294.2s)]
*  Anybody that has a non point card dribbling the ball up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=297.24s)]
*  I don't understand why it's not 80 feet of pressure. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=299.68s)]
*  Uh, Giddy was in, was in and around Luca all night. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=302.4s)]
*  Luca was just getting more and more pissed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=305.8s)]
*  Finally got a technical, he must've shoved them three or four times. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=307.92s)]
*  They were talking shit during the free throws. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=311.32s)]
*  And that's another way to get at this Lakers team is you can really fuck with [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  Luca. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  He takes everything personally. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=320.56s)]
*  You can, you could just be like, Hey, like think about, okay, see like, Hey, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  Lou Dort, just fuck with Luca this whole series. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  Just, just stand around him, stand next to him in timeouts. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  Luca is like a big, can I have my personal space guy? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=332.56s)]
*  Uh, and Giddy was just not having it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=335.72s)]
*  So I thought, uh, you know, look, they played out of their minds. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=337.56s)]
*  And as you said, they were making crazy threes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  Um, the Bezellas thing is, is a real wrinkle. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=343.88s)]
*  I don't think that's an overreaction thing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=347.6s)]
*  Um, but anyway, I was just thinking like blueprint wise athletes wise. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=349.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=354.36s)]
*  See, that's the game they're going to watch. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=354.72s)]
*  That's the game they're going to show their guys. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=356.88s)]
*  Like watch this, watch what speed and athleticism and pace can potentially do [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  if we meet this Lakers team. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=364.88s)]
*  I want to do a special gimmick here and it's going to be brought to you by workday. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  Are you a forward thinker? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  Then you need an HR and finance platform that thinks like you do workday, the AI [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=370.32s)]
*  platform that helps propel your organization, your workforce and your [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=376.32s)]
*  entire industry into the future. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=379.44s)]
*  I wish we could use it for the NBA draft in the best possible way. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=382.36s)]
*  Cause that's what we're about to talk about workday moving business forward. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  Forever. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=390.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=391.12s)]
*  So this is a no prep segment. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=391.4s)]
*  I did not do prep for it either. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=393.12s)]
*  I just thought of it last night watching Bezellas who I really, really, really [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=394.44s)]
*  like, and I was just like instant right now, blink test, redraft. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  Let's do a top eight. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  No, no prep whatsoever. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=405.08000000000004s)]
*  Just top eight gut feeling. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=406.68s)]
*  Um, my one would still be Castle. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=408.92s)]
*  Would your one still be Castle or is there anyone in this draft you like more than [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  him? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  Um, yeah, I, I'm not, I'm not ready to put Castle one. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=417.48s)]
*  Um, even though I know he's rookie of the year and there's just a toughness [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=421.48s)]
*  and maturity to his game. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=426.2s)]
*  That feels like a really good bet as far as the floor, but I like what I've seen [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=428.2s)]
*  from research. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=432.48s)]
*  So I still think he's number one. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=433.12s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=435.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=436.68s)]
*  Would it make the case for research? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=437.08s)]
*  Cause he's stumbled a little and now it's, now it's coming back a lot. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=439.2s)]
*  I think. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=442.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  Which I think it's to be expected. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=443.24s)]
*  There are just nights where I see him in his activity. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=445.72s)]
*  Like, I think what you always worry about with somebody who's just still an [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=449.76s)]
*  unknown is like, is he going to be overwhelmed by all of this stuff? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=452.2s)]
*  You know, physically. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  Is he just going to sit in the corner? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=455.72s)]
*  Cause I mean, look, even when you did the draft tape of them, there was [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=457.0s)]
*  plenty of games you're like, is this guy just going to sit in the corner? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  Like what the hell's going on here? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=461.72s)]
*  Um, and it's not like I was watching 20 full games of him before the draft, but [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  it was pretty clear early on, uh, that his, his comfort level was a little bit [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=470.0s)]
*  higher despite, you know, his physical disadvantages. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=474.56s)]
*  And I just think at that size and that kind of shop making, there's a, that's [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  the reason why that guy goes number one. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=480.92s)]
*  And that's why even through a rookie season, there'd still be a lot of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=482.56s)]
*  teams and be like, give me the ceiling of that guy, not just his spot up ability, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=485.08s)]
*  but off the dribble at that size. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, it's overused, but he appears to get it in a way that you hope [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=491.76s)]
*  when you're drafting somebody this high, like, okay, like, you know, there's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  certain guys that come in and immediately, you know, like, uh-oh, and, uh, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=500.12s)]
*  I don't have any of those concerns when I watch him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=503.32s)]
*  So I don't like, even if Castle would probably be the popular pick [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=505.2s)]
*  and maybe everybody's right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  Do you understand the ceiling part of it for his size and shooting? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=510.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=514.36s)]
*  The castle doesn't have, right. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=514.64s)]
*  I had, I had him in the blink test, no prep. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=516.28s)]
*  He, he was number two to me. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=518.64s)]
*  And I just like Castle a little more because I can see him as a top three [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=520.12s)]
*  guy on a contender down the road. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=525.12s)]
*  Reese's shape, probably the hoop sack. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  He's there. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=530.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=531.2s)]
*  He's always moving. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=531.76s)]
*  He's not like, uh, I don't know what I'm doing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=532.72s)]
*  I'm just going to stand over here. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=534.6s)]
*  Like he moves. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=535.88s)]
*  If there's, if they'll get it, if they get a rebound, he'll take off, like he'll [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=536.76s)]
*  try to get, he'll think like, uh, Oh, it may be if I bust my ass on this, I'll [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=540.64s)]
*  get the ball and I'll be able to get a dunk. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=545.88s)]
*  I don't think Trey, I think Trey is both fun to play with sometimes and then [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=547.6s)]
*  really not fun to play with other times, but, um, he seems like he's getting better. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=550.88s)]
*  So I would have him, I would have him second. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=555.04s)]
*  And I think that's a pretty good pick for them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=557.84s)]
*  I, where, where this gets interesting is the third pick. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=560.64s)]
*  Cause I think those are clearly one too. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=563.28s)]
*  I would have Castle first. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=565.8s)]
*  You'd have Reese's shape first, but I think that's the one too. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=566.88s)]
*  But the third from what you've seen, who would you take? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=569.44s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=574.2800000000001s)]
*  Uh, I think this is where it gets hard. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=574.96s)]
*  Well, you were probably driving home thinking Bezellas last night. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=579.36s)]
*  But I also saw Saur a week ago and I'm like, Jesus Christ, this guy's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=580.84s)]
*  Serge Ibaka with three point range. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=584.36s)]
*  Like this set, this looks great. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  But, uh, I look, I've watched Bezellas on TV a few times. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  Like really like watch, I actually like watching the bulls full confession. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  Uh, I was excited to see him in person last night. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=598.4s)]
*  And of course just randomly saw the best game he could possibly have. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=600.96s)]
*  I don't really know what he's missing from that position because he can shoot. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=604.56s)]
*  I like his stroke. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=608.2s)]
*  He goes to the basket. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=609.4s)]
*  He's really athletic and there's a little bit of a fuck you to him that I really [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=610.48s)]
*  saw for four quarters last night. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=615.36s)]
*  Like he's not afraid. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=618.08s)]
*  He's, he's, it's a little feisty. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=619.16s)]
*  Um, and I just could clearly see, I see what he is for the next 10 years. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=621.8s)]
*  And I think they nailed that pick. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=627.88s)]
*  So for me, it's either Saur or him for that third spot. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=629.36s)]
*  And I'd probably lean toward Bezellas. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=632.08s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's the Saur part of it is he's just getting so many more [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=636.16s)]
*  opportunities because they don't care. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=639.04s)]
*  But three of the last four months, he shot it really well from three [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=640.56s)]
*  and he takes those threes. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=643.4s)]
*  Um, I do worry a little bit at times when I've watched the wizards, where, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=644.84s)]
*  if it's a close game, you know, I don't know that they really care and I'm like, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=650.52s)]
*  Hey, Saur is going to get into his bag and pull up. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=654.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=656.72s)]
*  But he also might think like, if I don't shoot it, Jordan pool's just going to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  shoot it, so I might as well do this. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I think always the fear is whenever you're drafting kind of these [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=661.36s)]
*  unknowns and even Risa Shea, when we were doing the draft, I was like, this is just [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=664.76s)]
*  crazy when you think about this draft, like somebody like this is going number [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=669.04s)]
*  one overall, but then it was, you know, right back to the argument of Saur or [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  Reed Shepard, who can't even get minutes with Houston right now, who I think of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=675.88s)]
*  Reed were playing somewhere that didn't care. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  We would probably still be leaning Shepard third. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=682.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  If he was like the wizards point guard instead of Jordan pool. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=686.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=691.0s)]
*  Or, you know, whatever team, like, Bucelus is just not going to have, Bucelus [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=691.24s)]
*  is just not going to have the opportunities that Saur has and Saur's [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  rebounding three point shooting. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=699.96s)]
*  Like I've talked about, he's really only had one bad month with, with all of this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=701.2s)]
*  Um, you know, it wasn't a great start, but as you could say the same thing for [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=705.0s)]
*  Risa Shea, I mean, Risa Shea has shot really, really well now the entire [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=707.72s)]
*  second half of the season, so I'll still go Saur third because. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=710.72s)]
*  Just at that size and that shooting and how much I personally think that like [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=716.24s)]
*  you're a completely different team when you have a five out center, when you have [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=720.96s)]
*  somebody that can stretch the floor, you know, a couple of years down the road, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=724.6s)]
*  projecting what you can do in the playoffs. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=726.84s)]
*  I think it just opens a lot of stuff up. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  Like as much as we all like what the Clippers have done that went against the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=729.6s)]
*  Cavs, like I kind of get back to as great as Zou is and we all appreciate him. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=732.0400000000001s)]
*  Does it kind of limit your looks when you don't have a guy that can stretch [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  at the five and Saur is. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=741.0s)]
*  That is the hope is that they drafted somebody like that, that can play defense. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=744.24s)]
*  He runs really well. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=748.08s)]
*  I mean, he runs the floor all night long. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=749.24s)]
*  And I think that was, that's why that guy went to, even if it was really choppy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=751.08s)]
*  Watching him, he took the shots, which I guess is good. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=754.8s)]
*  Um, but now he's hitting them enough to justify like four to five attempts a game. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=758.4s)]
*  You know, I trust Joe house on hoops. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=763.12s)]
*  If he's actually watching as much as anyone in my life. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=765.76s)]
*  And he's been really good. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=768.76s)]
*  I want to back you up on that over the years, the text thread, when he has a [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=769.8s)]
*  very specific wizards observation, it's usually always on. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=773.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=777.48s)]
*  And this has been the case since the late eighties. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=778.4s)]
*  And I think he was more afraid of the bus potential with Saur than anybody. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=780.64s)]
*  And he's been saying all year, like he likes them. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=785.92s)]
*  Doesn't, isn't positive what he is ultimately, but there's definitely a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=789.12s)]
*  some Ibaka stuff in there and he's not afraid to shoot and his strokes pretty [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  good and you can kind of see what he is. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=798.64s)]
*  Like he was drafted as a stretch five. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=800.4s)]
*  If they were lucky enough to get flag in the draft, you put him like Saur would [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=802.12s)]
*  be the ideal guy to put flag next to, I would say, um, with those two together. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=806.28s)]
*  So it feels like they have something. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=810.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=812.48s)]
*  So you'd go Saur three, Buzellus four, and I would go Buzellus three, Saur four. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=812.72s)]
*  Sounds like. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=818.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it sounds like. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=820.28s)]
*  I mean, at some point here, we have to mention Colette Wehrer. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=821.16s)]
*  Well, I thought the guy we haven't mentioned yet is McCain who got hurt and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=824.72s)]
*  was looking like the most ready rookie and is only, I don't even know if he's 20 yet. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=829.16s)]
*  Um, but I think from what we saw from McCain before he got hurt, I, I, I [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=834.8s)]
*  might take him above Reed because I know Reed's not playing and I know it's not [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=840.52s)]
*  his fault and I know it's probably not a great situation for him, but I also [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=846.28s)]
*  think it's weird that he's not playing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=849.3199999999999s)]
*  I thought it's not like Houston does need him and they had a stretch where Van [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=851.56s)]
*  Vweet was out for a few weeks and he still wasn't really playing. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=855.12s)]
*  And maybe he's just a guy that needs big minutes and isn't capable of coming off [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=858.84s)]
*  the bench and playing 15, but I promise you, they thought they were getting a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=863.2s)]
*  little more from him this year than this with the shooting, you know? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=866.84s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  And when he, when he finally got minutes, that one game where he was really [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=871.6s)]
*  decisive and you could just see all the special stuff with him, that he is a [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=875.84s)]
*  really good athlete. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=879.76s)]
*  And then when he was coming off the screen, it was actually a little bit like [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=881.12s)]
*  Bronnie in that bucks game where it's like, okay, well, if he's going to be [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=883.96s)]
*  decisive, I didn't, I didn't ever expect to see this and maybe it's being [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=886.88s)]
*  decisive. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=891.08s)]
*  Like you can't just throw away all of Bronnie's attempts and say, oh, they [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=891.48s)]
*  were down 30, like who cares if he's decisive? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=893.96s)]
*  Cause he was decisive earlier in the game. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=896.08s)]
*  Um, but Reed had that game where he went off and you could tell he was reading [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=898.32s)]
*  how they were playing him coming off the screen, where I think when you're a [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=904.12s)]
*  young player, you're not getting any minutes, you're not even like looking at [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=906.88s)]
*  that stuff. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=909.72s)]
*  You're just going, all right, you know, what's the Reed and should I just get [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=910.24s)]
*  rid of this ball? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=912.88s)]
*  Uh, he was really good with, with that. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=914.28s)]
*  I also can see it as an email thing where young guard, yeah, I'm just [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=916.64s)]
*  going to beat you up here. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=922.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=924.12s)]
*  You're not playing defense nearly at the level I want to be at. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=924.32s)]
*  So you're just not going to play. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=927.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=927.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=928.84s)]
*  And they're fighting for playoff seating throughout all this. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=929.12s)]
*  McCain is 20. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=931.2s)]
*  Well, 21, um, yeah, Reed's Reed's 21 this summer. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=932.0s)]
*  So, you know, a lot of these guys, they come in a little bit older now, but, um, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  yeah, I think I'd still go shepherd just because of the shot making, but McCain, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=941.24s)]
*  you're right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=946.28s)]
*  I mean, it was the only good story of the Sixers all year long. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=946.6800000000001s)]
*  Like, I guess I just don't feel like in March after the draft of saying the only [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=950.36s)]
*  guys that produced have to be ahead of all of the prospects that aren't even [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=955.76s)]
*  getting opportunities and just shuffling it based on shot attempts. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=959.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=963.44s)]
*  I'm saying it more from, I just loved what McCain was doing when he was playing. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=963.64s)]
*  I see what he is. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=967.44s)]
*  He's a combo guard. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=968.8s)]
*  So you would take him fifth. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=970.4399999999999s)]
*  You might be right by the way. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=971.64s)]
*  So I'm, this isn't like me pushing back. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=972.68s)]
*  I don't know if either of us are necessarily even right, but I think I would [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=973.88s)]
*  take him right now over, over Reed, but I think it's close. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=977.28s)]
*  Um, and then after that, we move into this, you know, you got Bob Carrington, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=981.28s)]
*  you got Jaylen Wells, the kid on Memphis. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=988.0s)]
*  Edie's still there. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  Ware's still around. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=991.12s)]
*  Uh, Eve's Meesee. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=993.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=994.8399999999999s)]
*  Meesee on, uh, on New Orleans. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=995.12s)]
*  Um, Ron Holland, the fight starter and then Klingon, I think would be the, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=997.7199999999999s)]
*  kind of the next group. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1003.56s)]
*  And then it becomes a question of what do you like? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1004.64s)]
*  Quinton post. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1007.56s)]
*  It's true. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1008.8399999999999s)]
*  Quinton post. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1009.1199999999999s)]
*  Shannon's out there. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1009.92s)]
*  It's a weird, fun draft, but I think if, if we're looking at who has the best [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1010.88s)]
*  chance to be really good coming out of this draft, I think we hit the top six. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1015.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  Is there anybody else? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1020.68s)]
*  You will. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1021.92s)]
*  I think what's really interesting is how early the Dalton connect story was. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1026.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1027.56s)]
*  Got this guy at 17 and the fact that they traded him that soon. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1027.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1034.12s)]
*  He's alarming that they were like, we're good. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1034.44s)]
*  Now you could argue, Hey, it was Mark Williams. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1036.9199999999998s)]
*  Mark Williams version 2.0 has been better. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1039.08s)]
*  We know the injury history with him. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1042.36s)]
*  Uh, they should have still made the trade. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1044.76s)]
*  And their need and thinking, okay, well they've added Luke, like there's a glaring [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1048.2s)]
*  need, can you really make it through the playoffs with Jackson Hayes? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1052.12s)]
*  But Jackson's life is entirely better now because you're playing with somebody [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1054.6s)]
*  like Luca and it's just like, look, just show defensively attack at the rim, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1058.1599999999999s)]
*  run the floor all night. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1063.0s)]
*  He doesn't rebound though. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1064.12s)]
*  You can see it last night. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1065.36s)]
*  Like he's, he's great at alley oops. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1066.56s)]
*  Kind of knows where to go and what to do. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  But the fact that he's turned into somebody who might be a backup for a long [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1070.9599999999998s)]
*  time though, it was a complete win considering how lost he had looked for [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1074.48s)]
*  multiple seasons, but I think back to the connect point is those first few months. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1078.24s)]
*  And right at, you know, he's a mess on defense and yes, he's older because of [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1084.9199999999998s)]
*  his, his college travels, but it's like, I can't believe this guy got him at 17. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1088.32s)]
*  Are we sitting here at the end of the year thinking he actually probably went [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1092.48s)]
*  based on the names you've already listed here? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1095.9599999999998s)]
*  We hadn't even gotten to him that he kind of went in the range that you [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1097.84s)]
*  would still put him in today. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's definitely, I would say, uh, you know, like he's after where there was [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1102.6799999999998s)]
*  a three week stretch where it seemed idiotic that Miami didn't take connect [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  and that they took where over him. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1110.56s)]
*  And now I think, you know, it's also not like Miami's playing well. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1111.92s)]
*  The one that's, I think the most polarizing with different people I've [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1115.8000000000002s)]
*  talked to is clinging, whether this is just kind of who he is, a guy who can [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1118.48s)]
*  block some shots, who's a little slow, doesn't really have any offense or [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1123.4s)]
*  whether this is somebody that could potentially be the anchor of a really [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1126.48s)]
*  good team. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1130.24s)]
*  And I think the fact that he's getting actual minutes for them and they've been [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  a good basketball team for, you know, two plus months here and really competitive. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1135.76s)]
*  And I think he's a piece and feel the same way about Edie. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1140.08s)]
*  I don't know if they're ever, uh, you know, w one of the four best guys on an [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1143.4399999999998s)]
*  awesome team, probably not, but could they be in an eight man rotation on a [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1149.8799999999999s)]
*  really good team? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1153.3999999999999s)]
*  I think they could. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1154.0s)]
*  The clinging thing feels a little tough, um, just because when you look at [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  Portland and the number of guys out there that want to shoot, you know, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1162.0s)]
*  sharp should be shooting. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1165.72s)]
*  And Simon's is somebody that still bails them out of a lot of possessions. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1167.4s)]
*  Denny's going to get his shots, you know, scoot isn't shooting. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1170.88s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's nobody wants to be Chris Paul. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1174.68s)]
*  Their second season of their career. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1177.92s)]
*  Well, it's tough when you're playing with Denny and Denny all of a sudden turns [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1180.44s)]
*  into Larry Bird in the last six weeks when he looks like he's doing the 85 [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1183.4s)]
*  bird impersonation, right? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1188.68s)]
*  Unbelievable how good he is. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1190.76s)]
*  Even saying like, I've never played this well in my life. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1192.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't know what's happening. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1194.68s)]
*  Ben had that stretch last year post Boston was like, man, this guy can [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1196.48s)]
*  actually really score, you know, he couldn't crack the rotation for Boston. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1199.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you'll watch him where I don't think anybody gets happier when the game [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1202.8s)]
*  clock is with the shot clock off bands. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1207.08s)]
*  Like awesome. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1210.56s)]
*  Like now I don't have to pass this to anybody. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  So Klingons in a really tough spot. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1214.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1216.7199999999998s)]
*  As far as like, you know, he might be the six best option when he's playing on [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1217.48s)]
*  the court offensively for them. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1222.4399999999998s)]
*  So it, it, look, I think the considering like it went from, could he go number [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1225.4s)]
*  one to then he goes seven, you know, being stuck behind eight and Rob Williams [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1230.4s)]
*  update, he's got three to four weeks. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1235.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1237.72s)]
*  I just assume he's that playing. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1237.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1239.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1240.16s)]
*  If you see him, it's like a bonus. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1240.44s)]
*  It's like, Oh, there he is. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1242.04s)]
*  When did Portland get this guy? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1244.5600000000002s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1247.0s)]
*  Like you'd like to see some higher, like ceiling moments from him offensively. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1247.8000000000002s)]
*  But I don't know that it's entirely fair to like, Oh, you know, this might, but [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1254.24s)]
*  maybe those guys are right. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1257.88s)]
*  Cause I hear it too. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1258.84s)]
*  Like this is you guys were nuts. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1260.08s)]
*  He wasn't this good. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1261.96s)]
*  This is why he went where he went. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1262.84s)]
*  And, you know, he's a, he's a rotational big that they took this high. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1264.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, like, man, that'll suck. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1268.84s)]
*  And so really it's a six and then it's kind of a, let's see. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1270.6000000000001s)]
*  Depends on who you like, but we should talk about Ron Holland for a split second. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1276.28s)]
*  Who was the fifth pick in the draft. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1280.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1283.3600000000001s)]
*  He is still 19 years old. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1283.92s)]
*  He carries himself like he's 32. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1286.96s)]
*  They throw him out there. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  Like he plays real minutes every game. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes he's pretty good. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes he'll make some shots. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1295.76s)]
*  He's physical. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1297.04s)]
*  Um, he's a little early era. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1298.6000000000001s)]
*  And I don't mean this in a melee standpoint, Ron, our test ish. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1302.72s)]
*  Like actually reminds me of Ron, our test. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1306.68s)]
*  Hopefully he won't go charging in a row three at some point in his career, but, um, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1308.6000000000001s)]
*  they took him pretty high and I, you know, I'm not against it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1313.4399999999998s)]
*  They took him fifth overall. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  We don't have him in our top six, but I don't, I wouldn't rule them out. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1319.56s)]
*  Would you say he's 19? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1323.76s)]
*  No, but unfortunately the scattering report tracks on him. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1327.04s)]
*  You know, he had some okay months as far as shooting, but he's also shot at 11% [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1330.76s)]
*  from three, he shot at 11% from three. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1335.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1338.9599999999998s)]
*  That's in March, March. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1339.28s)]
*  He's, uh, at 7%. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1340.4799999999998s)]
*  Now he's, he's, he's not really taking them as much anymore. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1342.08s)]
*  I actually think that's like one of the funniest things about young [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1345.6s)]
*  perimeter players and they come in. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1348.12s)]
*  They're like, Hey, you can't shoot. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1349.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's like, well, time to learn NBA games. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1351.0s)]
*  And they just start taking threes because everybody just takes threes. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1354.4399999999998s)]
*  And then you can see it get to some guys where you go, Hey, maybe you [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1357.9199999999998s)]
*  shouldn't be taking even three a game. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1361.84s)]
*  So the percentages are even worse now because he's taking even less of them. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1364.12s)]
*  But I'm with you. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1368.08s)]
*  I love the aggression. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1368.52s)]
*  And that's what you saw before the draft. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1369.72s)]
*  There is a no nonsense part of him. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1372.76s)]
*  Isaiah Stewart. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1374.48s)]
*  I don't know if that's the best teammate for him to have or the worst [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1375.24s)]
*  teammate for him to have. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1377.64s)]
*  He's definitely going to be going into the other bench for the bench cleaning [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  bra, who'd be the first guy behind him. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1382.92s)]
*  But Detroit, you know, has spacing around Cade and that's what's opened up Cade. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1384.88s)]
*  They defend, they shoot. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1390.0800000000002s)]
*  So the Holland minutes, I'll admit, like I love the aggression that drives the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1392.2s)]
*  body size of like mixing it up with guys and like, there's never a moment of him [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1398.68s)]
*  where he's like deferring at the rim. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1402.96s)]
*  Like he's trying to go for it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1404.5600000000002s)]
*  But, uh, you know, there's no way he's closing with the Pistons. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1405.72s)]
*  I would imagine in a playoff game, cause he's just not going to provide any [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1409.92s)]
*  spacing, like everybody imagine in a playoff series, how he would be defended. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1412.2s)]
*  Like it just means there's another guy in Cape. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1416.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1418.6000000000001s)]
*  He'll say he'll, they'll throw them out for a little five minute stretches, but [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1420.52s)]
*  yeah, I think the playoffs will be a little different. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1423.24s)]
*  How many minutes do you think Ron are test played as a rookie in the 2000 [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1424.8400000000001s)]
*  bulls? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1427.88s)]
*  Like eight a game. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1430.24s)]
*  31.1. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1432.0800000000002s)]
*  Wait, he did as a rookie. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1435.2800000000002s)]
*  Oh, I was thinking Jimmy Butler. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1436.2800000000002s)]
*  My bad. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1437.5200000000002s)]
*  No, I would have said eight a game. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1438.0400000000002s)]
*  Uh, yeah, he was 31% from three. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1440.5600000000002s)]
*  Cause I loved him so much at St. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  John's that, uh, I don't remember playing that, but I also, I didn't have [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1444.88s)]
*  league past that year, so I can't say the 2000 bulls were on my TV a lot that year. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1448.88s)]
*  But yeah, he, and he couldn't shoot either. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  There's same size. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1455.4s)]
*  He reminds me of him a little bit. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1456.88s)]
*  Uh, any Bob Carrington thoughts before we move on? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1458.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1461.0400000000002s)]
*  I like Bob a lot. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1461.16s)]
*  Keyshawn, Kai, Kai, Sean George. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1463.24s)]
*  A lot of size, a lot of size for a perimeter guy. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1466.88s)]
*  Quinton post could have like a 12 year career. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1470.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1476.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, incredible, incredible scouting job. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1476.5200000000002s)]
*  And now he's the 50 second pick. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1479.4s)]
*  Collier set a couple of moments on Utah. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1482.64s)]
*  He, he, he was like averaging seven, eight assists a game for like a month. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1487.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1495.0400000000002s)]
*  I think he has a really nice, uh, handle drive combination stuff with him, but, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1495.7600000000002s)]
*  but Utah has all like, it's another group of guys that all just think, you know, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1500.6000000000001s)]
*  it's just a pickup game that never ends with the Utah jazz. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1506.5600000000002s)]
*  Just 15 guys not knowing if they're getting run. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1509.4s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1512.88s)]
*  We'll see how long will Hardy, uh, enjoys that. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1513.4s)]
*  And, uh, Dillingham just doesn't play. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1515.52s)]
*  Shane and junior had some fun moments when, uh, people were out and then. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1518.6s)]
*  Talk to me about your, uh, your Charlotte guy that you loved. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1523.56s)]
*  Salon. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1526.96s)]
*  It's just kind of a mess. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1527.76s)]
*  But you were expecting that. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1530.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1531.76s)]
*  In retrospect, six might've been a whiff too high for him. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1532.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1538.0s)]
*  I mean, he just, like, you know, when he's out there, so we'll, we'll at least give [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1538.4s)]
*  him that, but, you know, it was just a lot of running around, you know, when [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1544.92s)]
*  he's out there is not a compliment. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1549.88s)]
*  Um, Oh, I think it is. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1552.0s)]
*  I, uh, I think. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1555.4s)]
*  Booze Ellis falling to 11 is probably like looking back at the draft. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1558.04s)]
*  Who knows with all these dudes, they're all like babies basically, but, um, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1563.52s)]
*  that's the one that I think is going to seem weird down the road. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1568.0s)]
*  McCain, whatever. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  We knew that McCain was falling too far as it was happening, but [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1572.36s)]
*  Buzella's like a team like Charlotte. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1575.1599999999999s)]
*  That would have been a really nice pick for them. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1576.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, the knock was he couldn't shoot. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1579.04s)]
*  He shot it better in the first half of the season as he's played more [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1580.76s)]
*  minutes, he shot it worse, but strokes there. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1583.32s)]
*  But I would say he, yeah, I don't know. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1586.28s)]
*  Look, you don't have to listen to me. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1589.0s)]
*  You can listen to scouts because whenever you first started watching him, I mean, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1590.6s)]
*  if there was an end one mixtape and that's all you were allowed to look at, he's [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1593.8799999999999s)]
*  the number one pick in the draft. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1597.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1598.32s)]
*  So the more you watched him and scouts are like, we've been waiting for this [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1599.1200000000001s)]
*  guy to shoot for years and he's never really been able to shoot it, but it [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1603.8400000000001s)]
*  wasn't just the dunk that he had on the baseline Luca last night, there was [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1608.92s)]
*  another play later in the game where it was just really smart, like that [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1611.44s)]
*  secondary cut, which again, if you're playing with Giddy, like Giddy is one of [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1614.96s)]
*  those players, it's like, if you just stay active in the possession, if you [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1618.6000000000001s)]
*  just keep thinking that there's an option for you, you're going to be rewarded. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1622.24s)]
*  And he had a cut off the left side on a Giddy drive on the right side where he [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1626.6799999999998s)]
*  was, he was rewarded for staying active. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1630.04s)]
*  And at that point too, like the Lakers. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1632.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1634.1599999999999s)]
*  That whole team moves though. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1634.52s)]
*  It's really like that team is like, if I move, I might get the ball. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1635.84s)]
*  I did. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1639.8s)]
*  I really did. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1640.24s)]
*  I thought, uh, look, it was the perfect opponent for them, but I've liked that. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1641.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, what have they won? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1645.6399999999999s)]
*  Like seven of the last line they've been on my radar for a couple of weeks here. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  Cause I've been trying to figure out playing stuff and I've been scouting [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1649.7199999999998s)]
*  some teams, watching Miami just, uh, on the cruise ship to hell and just thinking [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1653.52s)]
*  like, could any watching Atlanta a little bit, could anybody, you know, emerge and [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1658.16s)]
*  be a possible seven seed in a team that's playing the Celtics. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1662.4s)]
*  And I think the, if the bulls got the seven seed and played the Celtics, the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1665.0s)]
*  Celtics would beat them, but that's not a fun series and those guys will be [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1669.08s)]
*  running gun, go, go, go the whole time. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1672.92s)]
*  You're not, I don't love it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1675.36s)]
*  You're nuts. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1677.04s)]
*  I'm just saying it's not a fun series. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1678.32s)]
*  I'm not saying the Celtics would lose. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1679.96s)]
*  I just, I don't like playing teams with gimmicks that are [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1682.4s)]
*  really confident in their gimmick. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1685.56s)]
*  There's 31 and 40. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1687.32s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1689.4s)]
*  What are they like eight of their last 10, seven of their last nine, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1691.1200000000001s)]
*  something like that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1693.52s)]
*  I mean, they traded Levine and they, they, they're playing better now. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1694.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1700.3600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, your guy, your guy, you sold your stock on a couple of years ago, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1700.64s)]
*  red velvet called the broker and like, just download it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1706.1599999999999s)]
*  Just get rid of it. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1708.6s)]
*  Did I? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1709.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1710.08s)]
*  Just get rid of it. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1710.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1711.6s)]
*  I thought we did a role play of that where I was like, we're still in. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1712.0s)]
*  Maybe you're still in. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1717.3999999999999s)]
*  I had in my head, you sold it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1717.76s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1719.4399999999998s)]

*  velvet, red velvet seemed a little back. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1722.6s)]
*  Our pod got a little too white. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1725.8s)]
*  We had a stretch there where I was like, dude, can you guys want Doug McDermott? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1727.7199999999998s)]

*  Hey, let me tell you about one of my favorite bets that Fandel has right now. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1772.5200000000002s)]
*  Player performance doubles. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1775.6000000000001s)]
*  We do them on Tuesdays, two leg parlays already made for you. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1777.2800000000002s)]
*  Let's say you think Luca is going to score 30 and the Lakers are going to win in a [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1780.88s)]

*  Um, other topic before we do our sliding doors thing is, is the Cavs lose [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  foreign around Mitchell. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1904.04s)]
*  I was saying last week on this podcast to you, first team all NBA was in pen. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1905.28s)]
*  And the Mitchell, the second half of the year stats for him are bad. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1911.32s)]
*  The Cavs tailing off a little bit where they're not going to be the best team in [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1914.6s)]
*  the league. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1917.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1918.3600000000001s)]
*  So he's going to take that spot now. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1918.64s)]
*  And is that Mitchell spot open for you for top five MVP and then first team all [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1921.04s)]
*  NBA? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1926.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1928.52s)]
*  Make your first all first team NBA case. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1928.72s)]
*  Cause I was, I was a little thrown off by this last night. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1931.6s)]
*  Cause then I did the work this morning and I'm actually kind of fascinated to [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1933.84s)]
*  know what your, your group is. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1936.6s)]
*  Mitchell on the best team in the East have a chance to win in the mid to high [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1940.44s)]
*  sixties, 24 points a game, four and five, 44%, 37 from three. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1944.48s)]
*  He's played 10 plus 10.9 net only playing 31.4 minutes a game, which is [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1952.84s)]
*  not his fault. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1958.44s)]
*  We always talk about it on NBA. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1959.16s)]
*  You can't penalize team guys because their teams are kicking ass. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1960.48s)]
*  They're not playing fourth quarters, but in the second half of the season, since [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1964.0800000000002s)]
*  the all star break, I think he's shooting 30% from three. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1968.56s)]
*  I test wise hasn't looked as. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1971.96s)]
*  As a, oh, I can, when I want, I'll snap my fingers. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1975.0800000000002s)]
*  I'll take this game over for you. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1978.04s)]
*  That hasn't been happening the same way. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1979.28s)]
*  And Edwards is playing really well. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1981.4s)]
*  And Edwards would be the guy. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1982.8s)]
*  If you're going to say who's taking the spot. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1983.8400000000001s)]
*  And that was the only guy I could come up with. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1986.1200000000001s)]
*  You didn't tell me who you were suggesting as another alternative to Mitchell. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1987.64s)]
*  And I was like, I'm at a loss because obviously it's not Brunson with the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1991.2s)]
*  games thing, Luca clearly isn't even close in the games part of it as much [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1993.96s)]
*  as we all love Steph, he's not first team this year. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1997.64s)]
*  So aunt is the only one that I could come up with. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=1999.8400000000001s)]
*  Ant's up to 28 a game. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2003.1200000000001s)]
*  He's shooting 40% from three, taking a ton of threes. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2006.44s)]
*  He's going to lead the league in threes this year, which is unbelievable. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2009.52s)]
*  Curry leading the league in threes. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2012.68s)]
*  It was always the safest bet in the world. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2014.0400000000002s)]
*  He's going to end up with over 300 threes and over 500 free throw attempts. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2015.92s)]
*  They're plus 4.2 net when he plays, he plays, which I think is really important. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2020.48s)]
*  Doesn't miss games ever. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2025.24s)]
*  And he is a excellent defensive player and Minnesota is playing better in [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2027.3200000000002s)]
*  Minnesota, I think has a chance to be in the 49 to 50 win range coming off a [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2032.5200000000002s)]
*  summer where they made, you know, a really, really impactful, huge trade. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2038.16s)]
*  You know, that they, that took a while for them to figure out what their team was. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  Then Randall got hurt. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2047.68s)]
*  D'Fincenzo missed some time. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2049.92s)]
*  Conley looked like he was dead the first six weeks of the season and they've [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2051.36s)]
*  rounded into a team that I think at least is in the conversation for, Hey, if [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2054.76s)]
*  somebody could have a puncher's chance of beating O'Kasey, who is it? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2059.48s)]
*  So I think if that last 12 games, I guess the point would be Mitchell doesn't [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2063.16s)]
*  have this locked down anymore. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2067.4s)]
*  And there's a world where Edwards could steal this from him. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2068.8s)]
*  Sometimes with these two, it's just, you're so determined to Ernie go with it [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2072.2000000000003s)]
*  that you have to be like talked out to an irrational sense of getting you to [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2077.84s)]
*  change your mind when if you just break down the counting stats, it's very close. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2081.6s)]
*  If you go to the metrics, they're pretty close. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2086.56s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple of things that favor Mitchell. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2089.48s)]
*  Um, that rating is the big one. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2091.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2094.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the one that would really still keep it with Mitchell is that, especially [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2094.56s)]
*  for the voters is that it's the best team in the East and he's considered by most [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2099.32s)]
*  of the models, the most impactful single player on the expected points added [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2103.2000000000003s)]
*  stuff, so he's the most important guy on that team, whereas Edwards is the most [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2107.6000000000004s)]
*  important guy in his team. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2114.8s)]
*  But like, look, I'm again, reminding everybody off of last week in the MVP [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2115.84s)]
*  conversation when I, you guys knew that I'm not always- [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2119.36s)]
*  Yeah, I used, I did it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2123.84s)]
*  I did. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2125.56s)]
*  And I'm, you know, I'm not ashamed of it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2125.92s)]
*  I'm glad we kept it in and didn't edit it out, but- [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2127.08s)]
*  That wasn't bad. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2130.4s)]
*  Here's the thing, the thing with Mitchell- [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2134.12s)]
*  I'm surprised that you're bringing it up considering I think it's going to factor [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2136.36s)]
*  in your SGA Yoke and stuff. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2139.28s)]
*  No, um, I would still have Mitchell first team. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2141.84s)]
*  I was just surprised that we're not done yet. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2144.92s)]
*  And I've said this in years past. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2147.48s)]
*  I think the counting stats get tough sometimes when somebody is [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2149.7599999999998s)]
*  sacrificing to be in an awesome team. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2152.8799999999997s)]
*  Mitchell could clearly score a 28 a game if he wanted to. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2154.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2157.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, and he, the stats are what they are because this is the best way for his team [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2158.16s)]
*  to win, he's also playing less minutes. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2163.12s)]
*  I still feel like in the right game, in the right situation, he's toe to toe [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2165.56s)]
*  against anybody else you could throw out there. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2169.7999999999997s)]
*  He's the least afraid guy. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2171.68s)]
*  He's the guy that need the most. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2173.0s)]
*  And that's why he still has the spot. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2174.8399999999997s)]
*  But I do think Edwards is as, is at least in the ballpark now, potentially stealing it. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2176.24s)]
*  The thing I kept coming back to is if you just switch these guys this season, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2181.2799999999997s)]
*  is Cleveland better or worse? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2188.0s)]
*  And I actually don't think they'd be better with a young Edwards still filling [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2190.04s)]
*  himself out, trying to decide how good he is as a player. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2193.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, if you just threw him into what they have, I think he's still figuring out his [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2197.64s)]
*  individual stuff a little bit better. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2202.8799999999997s)]
*  He's still figuring out his individual stuff a little bit. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2204.4s)]
*  And I think that would have probably hurt them a tiny bit. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2206.8s)]
*  Whereas Mitchell knows who he is. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2208.92s)]
*  He's been in the league long enough. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2211.0s)]
*  He knows what his ceiling is as a player and he's able to sacrifice a little [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2212.48s)]
*  because he knows it's the best for the team. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2216.92s)]
*  I'm not sure that's Edwards yet, but you can make a case if you flipped them the [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2218.6s)]
*  other way, maybe Minnesota is not as good with Mitchell because, you know, they [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2222.8s)]
*  lose the two way stuff with the ant and they lose some of the swagger and some of [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2227.7200000000003s)]
*  the other stuff he brings to the table. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2230.8s)]
*  So it's a fun combo at least. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2232.12s)]
*  We did a version of this with Saruiting on my pod this week, which is like, who [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2234.8s)]
*  would you rather have? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2238.44s)]
*  And it wasn't long-term. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2239.2400000000002s)]
*  It was just kind of like right now to close out the season, which is, you know, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2240.36s)]
*  what it's not the most original gimmick, but it's kind of interesting. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2243.32s)]
*  But he went with, he'd rather have Mitchell now and through the rest of the season. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2246.48s)]
*  Uh, I would, I would rather have ant. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2251.04s)]
*  I would rather have him because of the defense, but I think there's also a part [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2255.4s)]
*  of this where you could criticize ant a little for like, does he bring it [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2258.44s)]
*  defensively every single night? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2261.44s)]
*  His top version of his defense is better than the top version of Mitchell's [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2263.56s)]
*  defense, and that could be as simple as just being a size. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2266.8s)]
*  I mean, is this athletic as Mitchell is? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2269.64s)]
*  I mean, it sounds crazy to suggest you prefer somebody else's athleticism over [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2271.96s)]
*  Donovan Mitchell, but ants that guy. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2275.24s)]
*  I would put ant for, if he really cares for three minutes, he's way, way, way, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2277.72s)]
*  way up there with like the best guys in the league when he really cares. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2285.76s)]
*  If it's like ant, we need you to shut this guy down. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2289.44s)]
*  I would trust him. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2293.32s)]
*  We've seen it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2294.08s)]
*  We've seen it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2294.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2295.64s)]
*  And he loves it too. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2295.92s)]
*  He really like gets a rush out of doing it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2296.92s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2299.36s)]
*  It's just, he has such a responsibility in the other end. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2300.64s)]
*  I think he's got to pick his spots. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2302.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2306.84s)]
*  I don't, I know what you're saying about like ant and the maturing part of this is [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2307.08s)]
*  Mitchell gone through enough playoff seasoning that this is a better version [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2310.44s)]
*  of him of dialing him down a little bit. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2313.4s)]
*  But I'd say even with the way ant handled the cat stuff, handles the Rudy stuff. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2316.2s)]
*  That he actually shows kind of a teammate maturity. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2323.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2325.92s)]
*  And as far as shot selection and some of that stuff, I think they've been so bad [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2326.16s)]
*  at times this year on offense and you're right, they're rounding in a form. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2330.12s)]
*  And I know like, look, they lost to Zion because Zion went crazy. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2332.72s)]
*  Um, they lost to the Pacers in that weird game because Oby Toppin couldn't miss [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2336.6s)]
*  from three hits that ridiculous three in the corner, cause I was watching that [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2340.8s)]
*  game going, that was like a mid eighties bird three when he would like fall into [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2343.68s)]
*  the stance, that was one of the worst threes I've seen anyone take this year. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2348.08s)]
*  And he fucking drained it. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2352.04s)]
*  Oh, he had to. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2353.16s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2353.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2354.56s)]
*  That was, that was a really fun game. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2355.08s)]
*  So you're like, how do they lose to these guys? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2356.44s)]
*  It's like, well, you know, lucky enough, like having Zion, like Zion's now [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2358.24s)]
*  appointment TV again, because it's so much fun. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2362.8s)]
*  So I was like, all right, I really want to kind of see this game. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2365.2s)]
*  So I was, I was in whatever my mode of watching and picking who I wanted to watch. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2367.08s)]
*  I watched those two games after Minnesota looked like they'd figured some stuff out [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2371.0s)]
*  here and so I don't like, it's kind of, I want to get to the Cleveland losses in [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2374.2799999999997s)]
*  a second here too, cause you could kind of go like, what the hell is going on [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2379.32s)]
*  with these teams and in Minnesota, like at least that one's kind of explainable [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2382.84s)]
*  for those two losses. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2388.04s)]
*  And I think some of the ant stuff at least cause the three point shooting has [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2389.36s)]
*  been incredible, it's 40% of the season all season long, but you can tell how [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2394.2400000000002s)]
*  incredibly frustrated he has been at times facing all the double teams, trying [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2397.56s)]
*  to figure out like, who are the guys that I want to throw it to? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2401.28s)]
*  Like I know Randall's going to score. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2403.6800000000003s)]
*  Nobody want to pass it to Rudy. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2405.1600000000003s)]
*  Conley doesn't really shoot. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2406.8s)]
*  Devin Chenzo was a mess. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2408.44s)]
*  Um, no, it's kind of hit or miss. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2410.24s)]
*  I really like what Jaden has been for a long stretch here. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2412.3199999999997s)]
*  I think he's just been a more aggressive, super aggressive, feel like way more [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2415.7999999999997s)]
*  comfortable him having the ball now, probably at any point in his career. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2420.7999999999997s)]
*  So even if there's some metrics that say like defensively, cause I was looking at [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2424.7599999999998s)]
*  it this morning, like Mitchell and ant are both kind of negatives on the box score [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2429.52s)]
*  defensively. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2433.64s)]
*  That's that's, you know, I don't know some of the defensive stats. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2434.24s)]
*  I kind of give up, but if something like, if there's a player who I don't like on [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2438.0s)]
*  defense and I see for seven straight years of his career, he's a net negative [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2441.16s)]
*  on defense and the team isn't always a disaster, that's usually pretty telling [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2444.3199999999997s)]
*  there, but I don't know where ant was ever going to find his rest when he was [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2448.12s)]
*  sitting there trying to carry this team through all those dark days. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2451.12s)]
*  So him not being locked in defensively, like it actually makes a little bit more [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2454.44s)]
*  sense for him, but I would still have Mitchell first team, I think is how I [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2458.08s)]
*  would do this. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2462.56s)]
*  I just three weeks left. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2463.36s)]
*  It's, it's not open and shut yet. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2464.88s)]
*  You mentioned one thing with the ant that I think is a really good point when he [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2467.5600000000004s)]
*  would get frustrated with how teams were defending them, which I always thought [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2471.6000000000004s)]
*  was amusing where he's like, come on guys, just let's, let's play this. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2474.6000000000004s)]
*  Let's just play this like men, you know, it's kind of his attitude and you can [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2480.0800000000004s)]
*  see him get visibly pissed. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2483.76s)]
*  So all the smart teams are like, we do this. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2485.8s)]
*  He's going to fucking melt down. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2488.2000000000003s)]
*  He hates when teams do this. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2489.52s)]
*  He's not at that point in his career yet where he's like, Oh, they're going to do [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2491.6400000000003s)]
*  this. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2494.44s)]
*  Then we'll do this. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2494.7200000000003s)]
*  He's still taking it like personally that teams play him this way. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  That that's like, why can't, why can't it's almost like a UFC fighter. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2500.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, why can't we just stand in the middle of the ring and just throw punches? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2504.04s)]
*  Why are you doing, why are you doing this fucking ground game shit? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2507.1600000000003s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2509.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's go in the middle of the ring. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2510.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, so where's Mitchell knows who he is. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2511.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2514.84s)]
*  But Mitchell also was passing to Garland or shooting options or Mowgli or Allen [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2515.04s)]
*  who are all nice. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2520.24s)]
*  Like he has bigs he can pass the ball to. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2521.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2523.56s)]
*  And you know, Randall, depending on the night, you know, is, I'm trying to be [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2523.84s)]
*  nice here. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2530.08s)]
*  Uh, you know, he's an option and his passing is really good, but there's also [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2531.04s)]
*  times too with Randall when it's bad, you just know what's going to happen. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2535.44s)]
*  Like the possession is going to stop. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2538.0s)]
*  Everybody's going to watch. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2539.08s)]
*  You're going to see what happens. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2539.92s)]
*  And, um, you know, it's, that's not always a blast. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2541.44s)]
*  So Mitchell, I would imagine would be just as frustrated as Ant was, but the [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2543.96s)]
*  Cleveland stretch for this thing, I know that you're not doing it because they've [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2548.84s)]
*  lost three in a row Orlando coming back and winning that game. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2552.32s)]
*  But I, what'd I just say three? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2555.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2556.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2557.28s)]
*  Four in a row Orlando. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2557.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, we came on after that Orlando game. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2559.8s)]
*  We were upset Sacramento or Sacramento Phoenix. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2561.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2564.44s)]
*  We were upset that they, the streak was over because we had a whole bunch of [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2564.6800000000003s)]
*  Cleveland stuff we were going to do. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2568.0s)]
*  And then Orlando played really well and Cleveland just missed shots. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2568.84s)]
*  They, they, and it was like, oh man, you have those games in the NBA where [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2573.0s)]
*  it's, where shots don't go in. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2576.2400000000002s)]
*  Then they go to the Clippers and the Clippers just played awesome. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2578.12s)]
*  Like if you, if you're ever going to talk yourself into the Clippers or [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2584.48s)]
*  a true contender for 25, that's the game to go and watch the tape of. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2587.84s)]
*  Everybody looks good. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2591.76s)]
*  Kawhi looks great. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2592.76s)]
*  They were incredible in that game. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2593.96s)]
*  Kawhi is the best guy on the floor. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2595.0s)]
*  Like it was like Jesus and Mowgli played really well in that game. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2596.64s)]
*  And it didn't really matter. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2600.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like, all right, well, that's the best the Clips can do. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2601.12s)]
*  Took them by surprise. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2603.96s)]
*  Then they go to Sacramento and they lose that one too. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2606.12s)]
*  And then the one, the next one was the sons and the sons are like, look, we, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2610.72s)]
*  we keep waiting for you guys to bring Dr. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2615.6s)]
*  Kevorkian in and put us down and nobody's put us down. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2618.12s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2620.8799999999997s)]
*  And then KD plays awesome in that game. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2621.9199999999996s)]
*  So there are four losses that, um, I guess if you took them one at a time, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2624.2799999999997s)]
*  that kind of made sense, but the points they gave up, they gave up one third to [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2629.3999999999996s)]
*  the Clippers, one 23 to the Kings and one 23 to the sons. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2632.56s)]
*  And that is not good. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2636.7599999999998s)]
*  Rossello. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2638.4s)]
*  Nope. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2640.4s)]
*  And the sons who we started last Sunday with, uh, after that Lakers loss, they [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2640.84s)]
*  smoked the Raptors, they beat your bulls. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2645.6s)]
*  And of all the Cavs losses, that was the most alarming one. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2648.24s)]
*  The Orlando one, again, still shocked that they came back in the fourth quarter [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2653.2s)]
*  when you're looking at Orlando's offense. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2656.88s)]
*  The Clippers game, the Clippers played so well that you just go, okay, you know, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2659.2s)]
*  throw it out. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2665.0s)]
*  Sacramento's weird. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2665.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, whatever. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2667.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2667.96s)]
*  Sacramento wasn't great. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2668.6s)]
*  Like I know they didn't have Darius Garland in that game and they didn't have [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2669.68s)]
*  Mowgli for the Orlando game, but the Sacramento's down. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2672.08s)]
*  So bonus they're down Levine, which is kind of a hit or miss anyway. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2675.96s)]
*  It's like, would you rather play them with? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2680.16s)]
*  So, uh, DeRozan was terrific at the end of that one. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2682.4s)]
*  I thought the last Phoenix game was the one with Cleveland. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2685.48s)]
*  We were like, what are you guys doing? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2688.2400000000002s)]
*  Like you've just lost three in a row and the effort, especially in that third [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2689.32s)]
*  quarter, the rebounding stuff, like if you go through it, like none of these stats [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2692.88s)]
*  meaning anything, cause it's only four games, but the Cavs of all teams in this [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2695.8s)]
*  four game stretch, they're 27th on defense, not who they are 13th on offense, whatever. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2699.32s)]
*  They're 29th out of 30 teams in rebounding this week, the Cavs and granted [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2703.64s)]
*  Zou had 20 and Mowgli had three. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2708.44s)]
*  Zou demolished them. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2711.88s)]
*  Just killed them. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2713.48s)]
*  Like that. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2714.52s)]
*  And that's a guy that you would think the Cavs would be pretty well cooked to face. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2714.9199999999996s)]
*  By the way, we should mention we're recording all of this before they play [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2718.64s)]
*  Utah today and they might be able to get back on the horse. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2722.2s)]
*  I was alarmed by a different thing of that sun's game that if you're just [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2724.8799999999997s)]
*  projecting, what does this streak mean? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2728.04s)]
*  And then what does it mean going forward when they play Boston, whenever they [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2730.3199999999997s)]
*  play Boston, they couldn't stop the rent. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2733.64s)]
*  They, they couldn't stop them. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2738.2s)]
*  And if, as a Celtics fan, when I look at the Cavs and, and think of like how the [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2739.84s)]
*  matchups could favor the Cavs, how the matchups could favor Boston, ultimately [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2744.72s)]
*  it comes down to Tatum. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2748.28s)]
*  Can they slow down Tatum? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2749.68s)]
*  Can they stop them? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2750.8s)]
*  A big six, nine point forward who has the ball and that's why they [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2751.7599999999998s)]
*  traded for Deandre Hunter. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2756.2s)]
*  That's why they have to play a Coro, even though they probably don't love [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2758.04s)]
*  playing the minutes they have, but they, that's why streus becomes an issue. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2760.64s)]
*  Um, when it's a, when it's a bigger team with wings, like what Boston has. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2764.4s)]
*  I watched that game. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2768.48s)]
*  I'm like, Doran, that was the, I thought that was the best game I've seen him [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2769.24s)]
*  play all year and he was really, really engaged. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2772.3599999999997s)]
*  I think he took 29 shots. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2774.52s)]
*  He was like 17 for 29. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2775.8799999999997s)]
*  But if you're Boston, you watch that game and you're like, this is, this is [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2778.04s)]
*  the Tatum window in a series with these guys. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2781.72s)]
*  Can they stop them? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2784.12s)]
*  I don't know if they can. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2785.9599999999996s)]
*  That was one of those games where I wasn't watching it live and I knew I [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2788.0s)]
*  wanted to go back to, especially once they had lost. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2790.9599999999996s)]
*  So I was like, I want to watch this one tonight. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2793.2s)]
*  And then it was like, Duran had 19 in the third quarter, like what happened. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2795.2s)]
*  So then it's like, okay, we'll make sure we get all this. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  And that was the smoothest. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2802.48s)]
*  He looked, you're counting it up. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2804.52s)]
*  And then at one point, I think it's 11 or 12 and be like, how is he going to get to 19? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2806.16s)]
*  It's like, oh, he's just going to make everything else to [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2810.56s)]
*  close out this third quarter. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2812.72s)]
*  I did hear some of the defensive player stuff about Mobley in that one. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2814.2s)]
*  And you can get into the switching against a Rosen where he got him twice. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, and look, he got him once and then Mobley played the other one. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2823.24s)]
*  And like sometimes DeRosa is just going to make better shots than any kind of [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2827.04s)]
*  defense you can stretch in him. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2829.8399999999997s)]
*  I am, I guess you, Donnis was knocking him a little bit on the defensive player [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2831.72s)]
*  of the year thing, which just makes me think that you, Donnis is up there [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2835.48s)]
*  making sure people talk about BAM. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2837.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, but Mobley, Durant did not get 19 on Mobley in that third quarter, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2840.08s)]
*  which I think is important. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2846.3999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2848.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, the other thing is you, you can kind of find your matchup, the matchup [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  that you want against them and you can do that against any team in the league. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2852.16s)]
*  And they do, you know, if they have those two guards out there, you're [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2855.0s)]
*  going to try to hunt one of them. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2858.6s)]
*  Certain teams like hunting Allen and bringing them out. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2860.24s)]
*  Um, and I think one of the issues I have with the Cavs and I don't know if it's [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2863.2s)]
*  an issue cause it'll probably solve itself, but I still, I'm still not [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2867.68s)]
*  positive what their best five is, especially against different matchups. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2870.48s)]
*  And it might not matter, but I think they need Hunter to be that fifth guy. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2874.44s)]
*  And he just hasn't been in a lot of big games. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2879.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, and we talked about this last week. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2882.2s)]
*  He had that huge shot in the corner hits Orlando and he decided to backward with it. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2883.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, if you're guarding Kevin Durant or Jason Tatum and Hunter has to be the [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2888.12s)]
*  guy, he doesn't have a shitload of reps. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2892.24s)]
*  I really liked that trade for them. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2894.56s)]
*  But, um, I guess the good thing for them is the schedule is about to get easier. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2895.8399999999997s)]
*  Utah, well at Portland is not easy anymore. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2900.3599999999997s)]
*  San Antonio home at Detroit. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2903.3599999999997s)]
*  And then they're mostly home the rest of the way. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2905.92s)]
*  Um, but look, they were 56 and 11 or 56 and 10 when this thing started or 56 and [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2908.16s)]
*  14, they were two giant win streaks, right? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2914.0s)]
*  They were 18 and three against the West until this weird stretch. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2916.56s)]
*  They go out West. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2919.8s)]
*  It's almost April. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2920.6s)]
*  Um, even without a deep playoff run with this group, this is not who, who they are. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2922.04s)]
*  You know, I don't know that you can point to this week if they lose the boss [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2927.52s)]
*  and be like, Oh, see, we knew. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2930.08s)]
*  And look, I'll even admit, yeah, I think against DeRozan and some of the [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2932.16s)]
*  minutes against a rant, like, because I've talked about the Hunter trade too much, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2937.84s)]
*  but I'll just say it one more time. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2942.4s)]
*  At least there's an option for a big guy against the Jaylen Brown, Tatum, even [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2943.6800000000003s)]
*  Derek White, you know, drew holiday thing. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2950.84s)]
*  Cause that was four guys that you always felt like, Hey, they're going to find [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2952.96s)]
*  somebody against Garland here. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2955.76s)]
*  Like no matter what you do, there's going to be a way to attack Garland. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2957.1200000000003s)]
*  And then if you're helping over that, now you're leaving Derek White or you're [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2960.6400000000003s)]
*  leaving Drew in the corner or now, you know, obviously Tatum kind of attacks [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2962.92s)]
*  Alan a lot in that last regular season game that they played against each other. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2966.92s)]
*  So Hunter at least provided some kind of option. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2970.04s)]
*  So I think he has to be the fifth in that playoff series against Boston. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2973.08s)]
*  And that's really the only one that matters. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2976.6400000000003s)]
*  I think there's other games where maybe they'll want the spacing of [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2978.28s)]
*  Struce against a different team. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2980.92s)]
*  Struce would be the other guy. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2982.6400000000003s)]
*  May not matter. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2983.8s)]
*  You know, I don't know how Ty Jerome fits in and closing minutes of a [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2984.52s)]
*  playoff game next to Mitchell and Garland or he out there. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2987.2000000000003s)]
*  It seems a bit redundant. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2989.6400000000003s)]
*  So you may not need it, but I could see Struce closing or even Dean Wade, who's [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2990.6s)]
*  so good defensively, man, like constantly watching him get hunted because he's a [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2994.2s)]
*  white guy. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2998.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like the Houser thing. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=2999.2s)]
*  It's he's got a Houseritis. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3000.2s)]
*  Except he's even taller than Houser is. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3001.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3004.0s)]
*  And you know, he's another guy that provides you some kind of spacing. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3004.52s)]
*  So if it's a bigger unit, so like, look, we've been over all these different [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3007.3199999999997s)]
*  rotation combos, I've talked about it too many times, but I'll admit on this [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3010.08s)]
*  West coast swing, as I'm excited about the Hunter option for the Cavs, I also [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3014.12s)]
*  see him getting a little too upright. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3018.72s)]
*  I also look at him like defensively going, am I giving him the benefit of the [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3020.2s)]
*  doubt of some defensive option against Boston? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3023.04s)]
*  Just because he's tall. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3024.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3025.2s)]
*  Just because he's tall, in reality, like you can attack him too. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3026.2799999999997s)]
*  Russel, this mattered. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3029.72s)]
*  These four really good teams, I don't think lose four games in a row and they [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3031.2799999999997s)]
*  have real stakes. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3035.48s)]
*  And you can say- [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3036.4s)]
*  Oh, I don't think it matters at all. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3036.64s)]
*  I think it matters. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3038.04s)]
*  Can I make the case? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3038.96s)]
*  Well, yeah, of course. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3041.04s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3042.72s)]
*  Well, here's the case. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3044.0s)]
*  Cause you'd be like, oh, they have the one seed sewn up. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3045.52s)]
*  No. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3048.7599999999998s)]
*  They, they had a two game lead on OKC for home court in the finals and home [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3049.9199999999996s)]
*  court in the finals matters more than it ever has now because we went back to [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3054.6s)]
*  the two, two, one, one, one. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3058.12s)]
*  So they had this in their grasp. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3059.96s)]
*  And I also think one of the reasons I liked them is they've been so [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3062.56s)]
*  consistent and so good. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3065.08s)]
*  And after a while you go, look, man, the numbers are the numbers. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3066.4399999999996s)]
*  This is the best three point shooting team in the league. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3069.48s)]
*  They're awesome defensively. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3071.8799999999997s)]
*  They're able to hold their own against all these good players. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3073.6s)]
*  And then they just get smoked in those last three, especially Orlando throwaway. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3076.08s)]
*  That's a weird game. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3080.48s)]
*  You know, you're on Sunday, it's early. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3081.96s)]
*  You think you're going to extend the streak right before you go on the road. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3084.8s)]
*  But the other ones, they had real trouble against Kawhi and DeRozan and [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3088.0s)]
*  Durant in back to back to back. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3091.8s)]
*  That's a real thing that I think is going to ultimately, if you're the Celtics [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3093.84s)]
*  and even if you're the Knicks, you're looking at that and you're like, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3097.88s)]
*  Hey, this is good for us. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3101.4s)]
*  The Knicks. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3103.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3104.2s)]
*  If the Knicks beat the Celtics, I'm sorry. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3104.56s)]
*  I didn't want to leave them out. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3107.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3110.48s)]
*  But I mean, the standard that you're holding Cleveland to and saying this [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3110.72s)]
*  could be something that's alarming. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3113.48s)]
*  Then you're ignoring all the Knicks stuff, unless, you know, look, not having [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3114.64s)]
*  Brunson clearly do I think the Knicks are going to be in round three? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3118.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3120.68s)]
*  I think Boston's going to beat them. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3121.7599999999998s)]
*  I just didn't want to leave them out because we have New York listeners [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3123.0s)]
*  trying to cater to the Phoenix game was alarming. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3125.56s)]
*  The Sacramento one, you're supposed to win that one after the two losses [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3127.68s)]
*  already, but it was actually a close game. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3130.7999999999997s)]
*  Like it came down to the final few seconds in that one. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3132.48s)]
*  So it was an old school DeRosa. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3134.36s)]
*  I don't, I think they've been too good. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3136.0s)]
*  They put together that absurd streak. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3138.48s)]
*  We know who the players are. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3140.44s)]
*  It feels like this is their time. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3142.0s)]
*  Not saying in their time, because some of the playoff seasoning shit [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3143.28s)]
*  annoys me where okay. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3146.1200000000003s)]
*  See, it's like, well, they haven't done it yet. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3147.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3149.36s)]
*  Well, maybe for okay. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3149.7200000000003s)]
*  See their seasoning was just that Dallas series last year. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3151.84s)]
*  I think that that matters in that combo. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3155.76s)]
*  They have done it yet. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3158.7200000000003s)]
*  Cause that was a, that was a really competitive, awesome series. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3159.76s)]
*  So you can't say they've never been in a situation like that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3163.28s)]
*  You know, okay. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3165.5600000000004s)]
*  So we at least have to point to that. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3166.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3168.0800000000004s)]
*  Uh, you know, cause I feel like we've always heard it over and over again. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3168.5600000000004s)]
*  It's like, oh, the pistons had to lose to the Celtics and the Bulls had to lose [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3171.6000000000004s)]
*  to the Pistons and then it's just like on and on and on as if it never, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3173.88s)]
*  like Golden State was rather new. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3176.88s)]
*  Maybe their San Antonio series in 14 was enough seasoning for them to get [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3178.6400000000003s)]
*  through everything in 15 and the Cavs injuries. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3182.92s)]
*  Um, but, you know, did Toronto have seasoning or was it just a really good [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3185.28s)]
*  year and then they had their injury? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3192.44s)]
*  Shay. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3195.04s)]
*  I think we're good. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3196.28s)]
*  I don't think there's a playoff scenario where he can't get every [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3197.32s)]
*  fucking shot he wants in a series. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3200.2000000000003s)]
*  And Chet is the one you would worry about in a series like this, but [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3202.08s)]
*  check out his ass kicked in that Dallas series. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3205.52s)]
*  And if that didn't make him, he came back bigger, stronger. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3207.68s)]
*  Hartenstein had a bunch of, uh, playoff stuff. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3210.76s)]
*  Like really the, the, the one that the only one that worries me for real is [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3213.8s)]
*  Jaylen Williams, just because he's going to have the ball a lot. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3218.2s)]
*  And what did he learn from that Dallas series? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3221.56s)]
*  Cause it's going to happen again. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3223.96s)]
*  They're going to just send the two guys at Shay. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3225.6s)]
*  They're going to make Jaylen Williams have the ball all the time or [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3227.2799999999997s)]
*  Isaiah Joe or whoever it is. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3230.7599999999998s)]
*  How are those guys going to function when they're just like, Hey, look, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3232.3199999999997s)]
*  Shay's not beating us in this game. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3235.52s)]
*  We'll play four on three against you guys. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3237.08s)]
*  Go ahead, knock yourselves out and who's going to step up. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3238.96s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3242.12s)]
*  I would expect to like, even when you watch, okay, see if teams try to trap [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3243.04s)]

*  like, let's kind of do this. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3252.84s)]
*  I trust that there's enough playmakers, shot makers and options off of that trap. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3254.56s)]
*  That even if you're slowing SGA down, you're selling out and sacrificing [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3262.44s)]
*  something else that usually NBA games, if you do it too long, like you can't [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3266.52s)]

*  All right. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3371.44s)]
*  So, um, Houston takes Mowgli number two instead of Jalen Green in the 21 draft. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3371.76s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3378.28s)]
*  That's a great one. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3379.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3380.52s)]
*  Was that in the mix? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3380.6400000000003s)]
*  Why not? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3383.76s)]
*  I mean, I'm just saying, but when that happened, I'm trying to remember when [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3384.36s)]
*  during that draft, were we wondering if, yeah, you're right. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3387.56s)]
*  We were wondering if they would go two or three of that. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3390.52s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3393.1200000000003s)]
*  I just blew your mind. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3394.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3395.8s)]
*  I think this is going to be your favorite one. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3396.0s)]
*  I mean, I know you have ones that you've done probably like two. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3397.52s)]
*  So let's do it. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3400.48s)]
*  So I ran through a couple of scenarios. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3401.2000000000003s)]
*  There's plenty of, you know, as, as the ripples go through the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3403.04s)]
*  lake off the pebbles velocity here. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3408.1200000000003s)]
*  Uh, so that would mean no Jalen Green. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3411.84s)]
*  So, you know, we wouldn't be kind of stuck in this, what is Jalen Green [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3415.2000000000003s)]
*  riddle that's gone on for a really long time. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3419.96s)]
*  And I think the nice way of talking about it is that I think he's still really [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3422.6400000000003s)]
*  important to their offense because he can, what he can get on his own. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3425.6800000000003s)]
*  Like today's NBA, him being able to get what he can on his own. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3428.6000000000004s)]
*  I still feel like I fell in love with him on those non-Shangoon games [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3432.32s)]
*  at the end of the season last year. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3435.76s)]
*  It was almost like exactly a year ago. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3437.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like, this dude is figuring stuff out and it is a little weird and maybe [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3438.8s)]
*  worrisome about the Shangoon part of it. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3442.28s)]
*  Remember Houston. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3443.96s)]
*  So they take Mowgli too. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3445.2400000000002s)]
*  So now there's not the green part of it. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3446.7200000000003s)]
*  They took Shangoon 16 that year. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3448.8s)]
*  So if they take Mowgli too, they probably don't take Shangoon. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3451.04s)]
*  So he's not on the team. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3455.16s)]
*  I don't like doing just whoever is good after the pick that you selected. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3456.92s)]
*  Shangoon means you would have gotten this guy, but look, there's a Trey [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3460.56s)]
*  Murphy conversation who goes 17. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3463.44s)]
*  On that pick though, they traded for the pick because that was an OKC pick, right? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3466.04s)]
*  And OKC got out of 16 traded it to Houston and got these two like super [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3470.44s)]
*  conditional first round picks that I don't even think have really turned in anything. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3475.32s)]
*  So they definitely traded up for Shangoon. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3479.52s)]
*  The question is, do you do that if you also have Mowgli? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3481.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3484.48s)]
*  Even if we talk about bad teams and not wanting to draft based on need, I have a [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3485.8s)]
*  hard time believing that a team would take Mowgli, then take Shangoon going, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3491.0s)]
*  we're just going to roll into it. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3496.68s)]
*  Although who knows? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3497.96s)]
*  Like maybe Mowgli would be the best thing to play next to Shangoon. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3498.72s)]
*  That would have been an amazing combo. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3501.2400000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3502.76s)]
*  So you're saying if they draft Mowgli, no Jaylen Green and no Shangoon already. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3502.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3507.88s)]
*  Because he was, it was a 22 first and a 23 first. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3508.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3514.4s)]
*  I did all the legwork on this and those firsts were kind of those conditional [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3514.7200000000003s)]
*  rollover, rollover, rollover. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3518.92s)]
*  And I don't think it's one of the weird, weird, Presti moves where it's like, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3520.56s)]
*  why don't you just take Shangoon? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3524.36s)]
*  I got to, I got to tell you, I feel like I need to spend a weekend in a cabin [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3526.48s)]
*  somewhere and go back through all of the crazy, like here's four or five first [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3530.0s)]
*  rounders and just do a final tally. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3534.4s)]
*  Maybe we need to do that on a slower day. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3537.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like in August. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3539.84s)]
*  I'll admit there's just some, I go, you've completely lost like Marsha on [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3541.32s)]
*  Bochamp, like what happened there? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3544.8s)]
*  And I'll like, I'm sorry. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3547.4s)]
*  Like I know I'm supposed to know all of this stuff, but there's times where I [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3548.96s)]
*  reference will have that. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3552.76s)]
*  It has that trade pocket at the bottom of the guy's pages and you read the [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3553.6800000000003s)]
*  trades and you're like, dude, it's my homepage. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3556.92s)]
*  I'm on it all the time. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3558.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3560.2000000000003s)]
*  Then they'll, there's just some of these deals that like, once all the picks are [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3560.36s)]
*  done through, I think we might even be a couple years away from it all, but going [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3563.72s)]
*  through like what the cost, like two trades that felt like the exact same cost [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3568.04s)]
*  and the price that was paid are two entirely different worlds based on how [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3573.2799999999997s)]
*  the picks conveyed didn't convey anyway. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3577.52s)]
*  So staying with this theme here. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3578.9199999999996s)]
*  So, um, you know, who knows what happens with Usman Garuba and Josh Christopher. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3580.7999999999997s)]
*  Cause those are later first rounders as well. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3585.8399999999997s)]
*  But I think the other side of this is, okay, so Jaylen Green, not part of the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3588.24s)]
*  equation, no, Shen Goon, maybe they take them. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3592.12s)]
*  Maybe they put them next to Mobly. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3595.12s)]
*  It's terrific. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3596.2s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3596.68s)]
*  But then on the Cleveland side of it, does Cleveland sit there with Jaylen [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3597.6s)]
*  Green going, we can't trade for Donovan Mitchell in 22. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3601.52s)]
*  The answer is definitely yes, because part of the reason they did that Mitchell [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3606.2799999999997s)]
*  trade was they were like, we felt like we've hit a home run with Evan Mobly. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3609.72s)]
*  Now we're going to get it. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3614.12s)]
*  We've sped up our timeline now. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3615.12s)]
*  Let's fucking go for this because we think Mobly is that good. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3617.44s)]
*  You're not doing that if you have Jaylen Green. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3620.48s)]
*  I don't think for what they gave up with marketing and five firsts and all the [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3622.92s)]
*  other shit and the Kessler and that trade was expansive. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3628.0s)]
*  They did it because they love Mobly. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3631.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think it was that many firsts. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3633.64s)]
*  It was three firsts and two swaps, right? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3635.6s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3637.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3637.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3638.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3638.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3638.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, yeah, I don't think they do it. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3639.7999999999997s)]
*  So now, now we've altered the destinies of Cleveland, Houston, and Utah. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3642.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3650.7599999999998s)]
*  That's, that's the thing. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3651.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3652.6s)]
*  So there's two swaps in there. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3652.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, that's pretty good. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3653.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3656.72s)]
*  Cause I don't think, I don't think teams would take a Jaylen Green and then go, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3657.16s)]
*  let's do the Mitchell trade now to either. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3662.3599999999997s)]
*  And they would have Darius Garland on the team already too. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3667.4s)]
*  All right. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3670.96s)]
*  That's a really good one. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3671.2s)]
*  Great start. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3672.3199999999997s)]
*  Here's my number one. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3673.48s)]
*  It's an injury one, which I don't usually love for what ifs, but Murray [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3676.12s)]
*  tearing his ACL when he did like to me, the ultimate what if sliding door [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3680.28s)]
*  thing is did title shift, right? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3685.84s)]
*  This is one where he tears his ACL and it's right after the, uh, the [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3689.6400000000003s)]
*  COVID when they started it, it's after the bubble, they start the season late. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3693.96s)]
*  So he tears his ACL. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3697.48s)]
*  When Murray was potentially the most annoying human being in the world [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3699.0s)]
*  during the bubble on the sideline. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3702.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3704.36s)]
*  Well, that was a weird, that was a weird couple of weeks. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3705.2400000000002s)]
*  I liked that he's, he's no longer doing that. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3708.7599999999998s)]
*  Murray tears his ACL on April 12th, 2021, like a little bit before the playoffs. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3712.24s)]
*  So he misses the 21 and the 22 playoffs. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3718.72s)]
*  The sons ends up making it in 2021 with the team that looking back is like, wow, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3723.3599999999997s)]
*  that not only was that team pretty awesome, but that, that team came really [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3729.2799999999997s)]
*  close to winning the finals. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3732.92s)]
*  But now I look at that team and it's like, what would this team be at like a [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3734.0s)]
*  five seat in the West and then golden state makes it in 2022 because Murray [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3736.7599999999998s)]
*  doesn't come back in time. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3741.12s)]
*  And that's the one where if you're Denver, you're, I mean, they had [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3742.9199999999996s)]
*  Denver ends up winning it in 23. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3745.4399999999996s)]
*  I think Denver, if they have healthy Murray the whole time, I just would have [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3747.8799999999997s)]
*  them over that golden state team. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3751.9599999999996s)]
*  This great is Steph was because you had clay at a weird point in his career. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3753.2799999999997s)]
*  Draymond was at a weird point in his career. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3757.4399999999996s)]
*  I just think, I just think Denver would have been better. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3759.2s)]
*  Um, but you think they would have won back to backs? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3762.56s)]
*  No, I think they would have won 22. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3765.36s)]
*  And then I don't know what happens in 23, but I think they weird way of having [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3766.8s)]
*  the Celtics win it in 23. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3770.88s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3773.12s)]
*  No, cause they, they, Miami beat them in 23. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3773.7599999999998s)]
*  They didn't even get to the finals. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3775.92s)]
*  Um, I don't know how it goes no matter how you want to do it, but, um, I just [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3777.52s)]
*  think they would have won the title sooner than that. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3783.0s)]
*  And it's the only injury we'll talk about. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3784.84s)]
*  I know the net sliding doors will probably come up during this, but this is [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3787.2799999999997s)]
*  the only one where I'm really confident that the 21 or 22 finals would have [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3790.88s)]
*  played out differently in some way. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3797.32s)]
*  So I think this was the biggest injury. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3799.2400000000002s)]
*  The honest sprained ankle in 2020, I think was a really underrated sprain, uh, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3800.76s)]
*  injury when he got hurt in game four against Miami and then Miami ends up going [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3806.1200000000003s)]
*  all the way through, through the bubble. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3810.56s)]
*  I think you could argue that could have been Milwaukee that year. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3811.96s)]
*  And then Kyrie and Hardin going down in 21. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3814.84s)]
*  I think, I think those are the three biggest injuries where you could say the [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3817.04s)]
*  title probably swung because this happened or, or almost probably swung. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3822.36s)]
*  So I would have that. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3826.84s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3829.8s)]
*  Cause that Warriors team in 23, it was 22, excuse me. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3830.72s)]
*  Um, that was, that was like this story, but as it was happening, it's still kind [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3835.36s)]
*  of like, I can't believe this team's going to win the whole thing whole time. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3842.48s)]
*  Even during that Memphis series, it was like, and then, and then the Celtics [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3846.1200000000003s)]
*  when they lost the first game, they were up three, one, then Memphis puts it on them. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3851.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3855.96s)]
*  It was like, wow, this, this is what we're, one of these teams is probably making the [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3856.5200000000004s)]
*  finals. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3861.1600000000003s)]
*  Does Memphis have a weird time for the season? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3862.0400000000004s)]
*  How about this? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3864.48s)]
*  Does Memphis have playoff seasoning? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3865.1600000000003s)]
*  Cause of that? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3869.0s)]
*  No, I like, when you think about Memphis and who they've been, where they've been [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3870.28s)]
*  in the seating, where they've been in some regular season moments. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3874.52s)]
*  And it feels like they're on the cusp of like, are we getting a Western conference [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3877.0s)]
*  finals appearance out of this team? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3880.32s)]
*  I think there's even the moments this year, when you look at the standings, you're [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3881.96s)]
*  like, you know, if JAW is right, like do you love their closing five? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3884.36s)]
*  Like what's going to happen? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3888.16s)]
*  By the way, nobody, I think people obviously with Denver, which I think Denver's [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3888.88s)]
*  actually become a little overrated in this OKC conversation. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3893.52s)]
*  More than a little. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3897.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3897.96s)]
*  Um, and I even guilty of it, probably going back less than two months ago, I was like, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3898.48s)]
*  Hey, we still got to include Denver in that one chair. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3902.08s)]
*  And then the more I just kept watching, I go, you know what? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3904.0s)]
*  It needs to be the three teams. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3905.8s)]
*  And then it's Denver, maybe in their own group that Lakers push, maybe [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3907.0s)]
*  put Lakers with the nuggets. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3909.92s)]
*  Houston. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3912.36s)]
*  I think we all look at the offense going, what is that going to look like in [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3912.96s)]
*  crunch times of playoff games? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3915.52s)]
*  But now with the Clippers resurgence with the Timberwolves prior to those two [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3916.72s)]
*  losses, like there's a lot of stuff in there where you get through a ton of [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3920.12s)]
*  teams before you ever get to Memphis. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3924.4s)]
*  And you could argue that they've had playoff seasoning, but you could also [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3926.32s)]
*  argue that they haven't really had any, whether it be injuries or getting blasted [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3929.92s)]
*  out so soon with this group, also because of injuries. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3933.44s)]
*  I think if we were doing which best player in the playoffs, do you trust the [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3936.8s)]
*  least job would be the number one pick in that trap from, I just don't, what [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3941.2000000000003s)]
*  am I getting from him? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3945.96s)]
*  How many, how many games is he going to play? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3946.84s)]
*  Is he going to play seven games in a row? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3948.52s)]
*  I just don't, I don't trust that. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3950.04s)]
*  Cause I haven't seen it. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3951.6s)]
*  And I also don't think like, I think in a playoff series, overhardened, you [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3953.68s)]
*  would trust Harden more than John the playoffs. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3958.6s)]
*  This had no hard on one play. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3960.64s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, is not knowing what you're getting an improvement over [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3962.8s)]
*  what Harden has been for his playoff career. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3967.08s)]
*  So James Harden is a new man in year 19 near year 17. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3969.04s)]
*  Now you're right. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3973.4s)]
*  He's honestly do. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3974.28s)]
*  Cause even as I like, as I've talked up the Clippers a little bit, I purposely [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3976.08s)]
*  left out that part of it because I didn't want to be negative again. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3980.28s)]
*  I do it far too often. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3982.92s)]
*  I can't help myself. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3984.92s)]
*  He is one of my sliding doors though. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3985.8s)]
*  So I guess I'm not going to be able to help myself one more episode here, but [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3987.08s)]
*  honestly, like if everybody were healthy with the Clippers and flying around, so [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3990.88s)]
*  he's so, you know, it's kind of the thing I used to do to Van Pelt. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3995.6800000000003s)]
*  Like he would go, we don't do this enough. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3998.1200000000003s)]
*  We don't do this. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=3999.6s)]
*  I'd be like, Oh really? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4000.1600000000003s)]
*  Pick them, then pick them, pick them to win the series, pick them to win the West. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4001.1200000000003s)]
*  And he was like, I bullied him into it once. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4005.36s)]
*  He picked the team and then they lost. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4007.96s)]
*  And he's like, you asshole. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4010.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, and I was like, well, this, this concept of, and look, anybody [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4011.6800000000003s)]
*  that talks for a living, there's a lot of like transition into, Hey, no [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4015.76s)]
*  one's really talking about this team. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4018.92s)]
*  But watching the Clippers be this awesome version of themselves again, and that [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4020.2s)]
*  Cavs game and going through all the numbers and how everybody's making shots [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4024.44s)]
*  and Kawhi looking like Kawhi and quite getting after Mitchell defensively [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4028.56s)]
*  in a couple of huge possessions. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4032.08s)]
*  I was like, Holy shit. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4033.32s)]
*  And then I'm saying to myself, like, so you're going to pick them, you're [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4034.96s)]
*  going to pick Harden to get to the Western conference finals. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4037.36s)]
*  Or you're going to pick Kawhi to play for six straight weeks. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4040.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4042.52s)]
*  That's another one. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4043.04s)]
*  So I think jazz in that thing too. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4043.88s)]
*  That's a good draft. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4045.72s)]
*  You should do that with somebody. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4046.64s)]
*  Like use that. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4048.16s)]
*  I'll do it with you next week. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4048.72s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4049.88s)]
*  Talk about a few games. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4051.12s)]
*  I'm going to do a second sliding doors and then I'll throw it back to you [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4052.2400000000002s)]
*  because it's tied into the injury thing with, uh, but to finish the Denver [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4056.4s)]
*  thing, you think Murray healthy. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4060.44s)]
*  They get the one in 22. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4062.04s)]
*  I think they went in 22. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4063.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4064.64s)]
*  Cause Yokochi was that good by then. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4065.04s)]
*  And I, their supporting cast was good. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4066.64s)]
*  I think they would have been the best team, um, which ties into the other one. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4068.36s)]
*  It's kind of a one a one B the, uh, the, what if the 2021 nets don't break [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4072.12s)]
*  down is a great one. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4077.04s)]
*  Because that they had that Celtic series where they looked like they might have a [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4079.6s)]
*  chance to be the greatest offensive team of all time and they're actually [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4084.16s)]
*  playing well together. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4086.8s)]
*  And then I think Kyrie got hers. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4088.4s)]
*  Kyrie sprained his ankle, hardened and hurt his hamstring, tried to keep playing. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4090.64s)]
*  Um, there's so many, and then they ended up losing cause KD steps on the line, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4095.08s)]
*  but you know, Milwaukee barely beats them getting incredible injury luck and [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4099.6s)]
*  they still barely win. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4106.4s)]
*  It takes them overtime gave seven and beat them. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4107.48s)]
*  So then you got all the, if those guys don't get hurt, does Yannis ever make a finals? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4110.08s)]
*  Do the nets actually win the title? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4116.5199999999995s)]
*  How do we talk about Kevin Durant now? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4118.48s)]
*  Are those guys all still together? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4120.599999999999s)]
*  Do we talk about hardened? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4122.639999999999s)]
*  We, like you just mentioned hardened five minutes ago. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4123.919999999999s)]
*  Well, what if they won the finals that year? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4126.5199999999995s)]
*  How do we talk about him? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4128.719999999999s)]
*  How do we talk about Kyrie? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4130.12s)]
*  Who gets traded? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4131.36s)]
*  Does Kyrie even end up on Dallas? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4132.28s)]
*  Does hardened end up on two more teams? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4134.4s)]
*  Does KD end up on Phoenix? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4136.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, that is one of those, when you talk about sliding doors, there's an [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4138.08s)]
*  alternate universe and Zach Lowe is just to call them the greatest hypothetical team. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4143.5599999999995s)]
*  There's an alternate universe where we talk about that team, like they're the 99 [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4147.48s)]
*  Rams, we're like, Oh my God, remember that those guys, and then they scored 130 a [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4150.639999999999s)]
*  game and went 14 and 16 and two in the playoffs. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4156.44s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4161.28s)]
*  But didn't happen. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4162.88s)]
*  There's, you could do an entire, like this Celtic stock, you could do maybe a [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4166.32s)]
*  20 parter on all the what ifs with the nets over this, because I went deep into [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4171.28s)]
*  the hardened contract stuff this morning and I did it last week and I was double [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4175.28s)]
*  checking with somebody on all the numbers of the extensions that he was turning down. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4179.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4182.24s)]
*  I like staying, let's stay on this side of it. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4184.92s)]
*  Which ring do you think is more important? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4187.719999999999s)]
*  Janos getting that one or Jokic getting his in 23? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4189.599999999999s)]
*  I honestly Janos, cause I don't think there's a path for him. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4193.24s)]
*  Otherwise, I think that was their one best chance to win. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4197.44s)]
*  And if he doesn't win there, he starts to move into that Berkeley area. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4201.879999999999s)]
*  And it becomes the dominant theme with him for the last couple of years, even [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4208.04s)]
*  before the Dame trade, we're like, Whoa, is Janos ever, is he ever going to make [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4211.44s)]
*  the finals? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4214.2s)]
*  How good can he be? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4215.16s)]
*  We're just doing that for three years and not like he'd give a shit. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4216.2s)]
*  He's not even from America. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4220.6s)]
*  He doesn't understand how stupid half the shit is that we obsess over. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4222.04s)]
*  But I just think that I think he would have been the guy for this decade. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4225.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4229.080000000001s)]
*  How good is he Janos and Jokic both took that off the table. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4229.72s)]
*  Luca at least made the finals last year, but Luca, you know, if it doesn't happen [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4233.320000000001s)]
*  for the Lakers for a couple of years, we'll be dealing with him, but this is what we do. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4237.240000000001s)]
*  It's a, it's a, it's a you guys. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4242.72s)]
*  I don't feel like we're in the you guys on this as much, but I don't know. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4245.320000000001s)]
*  I think it is, but I'm not, I'm not lumping you in with everybody else. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4248.68s)]
*  Cause my first thought was it was Jokic because we were talking about Jokic with [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4252.08s)]
*  all these MVPs and back in the conversation and Janos, you know, unfortunately it feels [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4255.76s)]
*  like no matter what he does, he's just not as much of a conversation. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4260.400000000001s)]
*  Um, I think one year I, I was looking back to like my MVP voting, cause I was looking [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4265.4800000000005s)]
*  at some other voters who I'm just, you want to talk agendas? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4271.04s)]
*  Like, this is such a joke. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4273.8s)]
*  I hope you have a vote. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4274.84s)]
*  You put in the work, you watch the games, you should get a vote. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4276.0s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you saying that, but I look at it as, as something when you get done [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4279.24s)]
*  with it, I don't, I don't know how you could ever be like, yeah, nailed it. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4283.04s)]
*  Because whenever you try to slot in Janos, like I bet you, if you averaged out my MVP [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4285.72s)]
*  voting years, I would have Janos higher than whatever, you know, his MVP voting years. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4292.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4299.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4299.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4300.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4301.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4301.64s)]
*  Then whatever, you know, his average finish would be. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4302.5199999999995s)]
*  And yet with Jokic, I think it's a different tier that he's chasing. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4306.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4313.599999999999s)]
*  And I think he would get more shit without a ring than Janos would. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4313.88s)]
*  I think for Janos, it would be. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4317.32s)]
*  Because you think Jokic has the chance to be one of the 10 best players of all time. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4318.679999999999s)]
*  Or is Janos is in that 10 to 20 range? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4322.92s)]
*  Probably. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4324.96s)]
*  It's a pretty simple formula. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4325.2s)]
*  If we have these conversations about you, the same thing with the quarterbacks, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4326.76s)]
*  where it's like, okay, this guy is one of the four or five best quarterbacks [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4331.76s)]
*  with all these different things. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4334.88s)]
*  When you lose in the playoffs, it's way worse than the 10th or 12th guy. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4335.64s)]
*  And for Jokic, we're talking about like chasing top 10 in history. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4340.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't think we're talking about that anymore with Janos. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4343.84s)]
*  We probably were during that final stretch, right? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4345.64s)]
*  I also think there'd be a part of this with Janos where it would become, can you [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4348.08s)]
*  win with this approach when it's like, well, dude, I'm so glad that he won [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4352.320000000001s)]
*  because I see somebody that reads defenses really well. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4356.24s)]
*  He stopped taking threes. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4359.96s)]
*  I think he's a more efficient person. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4361.44s)]
*  Plays his fucking ass off. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4362.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4363.759999999999s)]
*  He wants to kill everyone in the other uniform the entire time he is out there. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4364.16s)]
*  And it just, it's a bit like the Garnett thing because he keeps losing in the [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4368.759999999999s)]
*  playoffs, you have to start questioning him. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4372.12s)]
*  And I think the only thing that was fair. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4374.12s)]
*  Two bad luck injuries with him too, in the playoffs, like at the wrong times. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4375.24s)]
*  If you were doing the full scope of it, it's like, look, as great as Garnett was, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4379.24s)]
*  he probably couldn't have always been the number one scoring option to close out a [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4382.839999999999s)]
*  tied playoff game because he was always probably a little bit more apprehensive [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4386.799999999999s)]
*  offensively than I wished that he was. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4390.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4393.12s)]
*  But to suggest that he was a loser because he was losing all the time was wrong. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4393.28s)]
*  Are people actually doing that? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4399.56s)]
*  Cause I remember him just being this incredibly sympathetic figure, basically, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4401.0s)]
*  you know, cause Glenn Taylor, he lost all those picks and the Joe Smith thing. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4405.6s)]
*  Marbury left. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4408.64s)]
*  And then it was just like, his supporting cast was so bad. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4409.92s)]
*  At least the stuff I was writing back then was like, we got to rescue this guy [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4413.04s)]
*  from Minnesota almost became the narrative. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4417.8s)]
*  Yanis, I think has had more help than KG did. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4419.72s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4423.84s)]
*  I mean, those, those teams, you just go through it and you see who's like, I [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4424.64s)]
*  always like looking up like who would took the third most shots for this team. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4427.4400000000005s)]
*  You're like Trenton Hassel. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4430.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4432.320000000001s)]
*  They got one really good Cassell here and it felt like a miracle. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4432.52s)]
*  It's like, Oh my God, their point guards averaging 17 and eight. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4436.04s)]
*  But I want to finish the point though, only because it would, it would [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4439.320000000001s)]
*  crush me as a basketball fan to watch the way Yanis plays. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4443.16s)]
*  And with all of the great things that we just talked about, right? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4447.4s)]
*  All of the great things that it would then lead to there's something wrong [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4449.88s)]
*  with him if he didn't have the ring. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4455.32s)]
*  So I think you could make a really good argument for which guy would take more [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4457.4s)]
*  shit, sans a ring here because. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4461.24s)]
*  Jokic is like touching a totally different historic tier. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4465.5199999999995s)]
*  I think Yanis is when it's all said and done, like, what is this guy going to be? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4471.88s)]
*  Because the standard for him would be higher because of the way we're talking [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4476.32s)]
*  about him again, it feels a little dismissive of Yanis, but we're talking [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4479.12s)]
*  about like, Hey, top 10 of all time in this sport versus Yanis who probably [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4481.68s)]
*  lands in the top 20, you know, I don't know. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4486.24s)]
*  I mean, you know, the stuff better than I do. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4488.28s)]
*  No, I could tell you Yanis is we're talking about the Hakeem Shaq Moses kind of [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4490.24s)]
*  area, right? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4495.4s)]
*  And we're in Jokic. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4496.56s)]
*  What's possible is I'm like the bird and magic suite, like knocking on the door. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4497.6s)]
*  Now, like I am the natural legacy to you guys. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4501.4s)]
*  They would get, it would be a good segment to do that too. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4505.72s)]
*  Like we're just rank. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4509.0s)]
*  We're just producing shows here right now is who are the most like go last 20 [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4509.92s)]
*  years, the most important rings, like how important is Steph's fourth ring? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4514.280000000001s)]
*  You know, I think I would have Steph's fourth ring over all of them. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4518.0s)]
*  I think it vaulted them into a completely different area. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4523.0s)]
*  No kidding. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4525.76s)]
*  I think Steph's fourth is more important than Jokic or Yanis's first or only. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4526.72s)]
*  I do, because those guys still have a chance to win another one. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4531.360000000001s)]
*  And Steph didn't and Steph, there always would have been a little asterisk next to [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4534.32s)]
*  him and all it did was put him right with Kobe and West and, you know, right in that [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4538.48s)]
*  group and he's probably leading the way in that group. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4544.48s)]
*  He'd be, I mean, you can never say, Oh, you, the first one, LeBron got all his [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4546.719999999999s)]
*  teammates got hurt in 15 and then the next two you had to rant. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4551.4s)]
*  That's why you won. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4554.36s)]
*  He, there was always a yeah, but with him and the yeah, butts were gone. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4555.0s)]
*  We talked about it when it happened. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4557.92s)]
*  Yanis MVP voting since 19, one, one, four, three, three, four. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4559.599999999999s)]
*  And he's going to be three or four this year. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4567.5599999999995s)]
*  Probably four straight years in the top four. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4569.599999999999s)]
*  I voted him second last year. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4574.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4577.08s)]
*  You were, I enjoyed it. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4577.36s)]
*  I did not, but I liked your reasoning. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4579.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4582.0s)]
*  And I know that I went back and looked at it a bunch of times and I was like, you [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4582.76s)]
*  consistently have him higher than other people do. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4587.32s)]
*  And look on some stuff, I'm impossibly stubborn. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4591.4s)]
*  I will not change my mind. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4595.08s)]
*  I don't care what you have to say on this. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4596.28s)]
*  I'm not stubborn. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4598.48s)]
*  Like I, I might be wrong, but I just felt like, I don't, I don't know if the list [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4599.759999999999s)]
*  is very long of dudes that are more impactful this season again than that guy. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4604.96s)]
*  So, uh, you know, we agree. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4609.36s)]
*  What happens I think, uh, I still, if I had to do MVP right now, I would still [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4611.5599999999995s)]
*  put Tatum three and Giannis for, because I just think what Tatum has done this [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4615.96s)]
*  year has been incredible. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4620.64s)]
*  Um, being point forward, guarding five positions, being the best rebounder in [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4622.4s)]
*  the team and having more team success. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4626.36s)]
*  I don't, I don't know what else you would want, you know, and Giannis is having [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4628.88s)]
*  the same 30, 12 and six that he has every year. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4631.84s)]
*  And, you know, it's some of the same stuff with him down the stretch of games, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4635.24s)]
*  um, the way teams play him. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4640.04s)]
*  I, I think he's, I don't want to say hard to play with, but. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4641.8s)]
*  You kind of have to tailor the team to what he can and can't do, you know? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4646.32s)]
*  And he's, he's really a center. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4651.0s)]
*  And if you just think of him as a perimeter center, it probably makes more [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4652.52s)]
*  sense, but I just think Tatum has been slightly better this year. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4655.4s)]
*  I still think it has to be one of the three most horrifying things in [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4659.68s)]
*  basketball when Giannis has decided. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4662.68s)]
*  No question. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4665.16s)]
*  He's going to go to the. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4665.6s)]
*  Well, that, that thing with the playoffs here, I was talking to a Knicks fan [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4666.04s)]
*  yesterday, who do you not want to see in the three spot if it's between Detroit, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4669.08s)]
*  Milwaukee, Indiana, who's the not, I don't want to see that team. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4675.4800000000005s)]
*  And the case for Milwaukee is I just don't want to see Giannis for two weeks. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4679.72s)]
*  How was that even a conversation? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4683.04s)]
*  Well, cause those are the three choices. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4684.72s)]
*  Obviously Detroit, you'd want to see the most cause it's Kade and a bunch of [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4686.56s)]
*  guys I've been there, but Indiana is a team that plays really well against them. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4689.6s)]
*  That pressures that they have those guards that just pressure full time. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4693.4800000000005s)]
*  They have a ton of confidence against them. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4696.92s)]
*  They're deep and Milwaukee is kind of a messed up team. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4698.6s)]
*  Like they're not that good. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4702.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, there's still would rather play, you know, there's an argument to be made [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4704.72s)]
*  because the Pacers are like a mirror version of you as the Knicks. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4708.04s)]
*  It's like, who knows what happens in that free for all. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4710.8s)]
*  Like I wouldn't want to play the Pacers. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4713.6s)]
*  Pacers are number one for me. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4715.04s)]
*  I'd rather, I'd rather take my chances with this Bucks team and Kuzma and some [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4717.280000000001s)]
*  of the bench dudes and I, you know what? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4722.6s)]
*  Let's give Giannis is 30 and 12 every night. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4725.320000000001s)]
*  We're still beating these guys. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4728.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4733.08s)]
*  I just feels crazy picking the pace. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4733.88s)]
*  I'd rather play Giannis than the Pacers, but I understand the part of it. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4735.72s)]
*  And especially knowing the Knicks and who they are and going, Hey, the Pacers [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4738.84s)]
*  is just going to run and not defend with us for seven games too. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4743.12s)]
*  And then who knows what happens. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4745.76s)]
*  Well, and they're also going to, they're going to really pressure Brunson. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4747.12s)]
*  Who's coming off an injury. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4750.320000000001s)]
*  They're going to make him dribble for 90 feet every time he's going to foul him [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4751.76s)]
*  30 times, hack them or talk shit. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4755.56s)]
*  I would not want to see them. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4758.4800000000005s)]
*  Let's take a, let's take a break and then we'll finish sliding doors. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4759.6s)]
*  All right. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4762.6s)]
*  What do you have for your next sliding doors? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4762.76s)]
*  Uh, I'll just keep it with this off of the nets thing. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4765.16s)]
*  Cause I think it's a really good point, especially when those guys were playing [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4767.6s)]
*  and you were sorting the stats going to people. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4770.56s)]
*  Cause like, I think a little bit gets overstated in each season. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4772.8s)]
*  We're like, Hey, do you realize that this team is now on pace to be the [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4776.360000000001s)]
*  greatest offensive all time? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4778.64s)]
*  Like Dallas had it a couple of years ago for this stretch. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4779.84s)]
*  It's like, okay, but at no point do I look at this team? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4782.360000000001s)]
*  It's the rising tides thing as offenses get better and better every single year. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4784.68s)]
*  But there was some net stuff that was happening with that group and they [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4788.16s)]
*  were winning all of those games. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4790.92s)]
*  In the rare occasion that those dudes were playing. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4792.76s)]
*  So I love that one. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4794.56s)]
*  All right. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4795.68s)]
*  So Harden, we know turned down an extension with Houston. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4795.92s)]
*  That was like a hundred million on top of the hundred that he was owed. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4799.2s)]
*  He turned that one down before the 21 season started. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4802.84s)]
*  Remember there's that deadline before the season gets going where [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4806.08s)]
*  he can sign an extension. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4808.4400000000005s)]
*  He was offered three years, 160 million. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4810.76s)]
*  That would have been on top of a player option of 47.4 million. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4813.52s)]
*  He turned that one down because he was actually eligible for an extension [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4818.4400000000005s)]
*  for 225 million for four more years. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4822.4s)]
*  So of all of these scenarios, he ended up demanding a trade after [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4825.96s)]
*  he had called Brooklyn home. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4831.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4833.879999999999s)]
*  So we're all on the same page. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4834.2s)]
*  But again, I, I'm sympathetic to Harden a couple of different [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4835.2s)]
*  times in the Harden timeline. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4838.28s)]
*  And in the case of him being frustrated with the nets and going like, what the [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4840.36s)]
*  hell's going on over here, you know, the Kyrie stuff, he didn't want to be there [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4843.32s)]
*  anymore. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4846.879999999999s)]
*  I don't like the way he handled it, but that's what he ends up doing. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4847.28s)]
*  He moves on. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4850.5599999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4851.759999999999s)]
*  So instead of hitting free agency and signing any of these things that he's [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4852.4s)]
*  already been offered, he goes to Philly and does a two year deal for 68 million [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4858.639999999999s)]
*  with the player option for the next year at 35.7. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4866.08s)]
*  To allegedly give them a chance to get more guys because he does a lesser deal. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4869.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4874.639999999999s)]
*  You do get more guys. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4874.839999999999s)]
*  But he's, but the real thing was like, we'll take care of you in two years. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4876.0s)]
*  If you do this. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4879.08s)]
*  But yeah, and that's why I've always kind of taken Harden's side is that if he [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4880.04s)]
*  has already turned down a hundred million dollar extension from Houston, that was [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4883.280000000001s)]
*  going to make him the highest paid player in the NBA, there's 161 million [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4886.0s)]
*  dollar extension. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4889.360000000001s)]
*  That's all the nets could offer him before the season. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4890.12s)]
*  But he was like, look, I'm going to turn it down. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4892.16s)]
*  I'm going to go to free agents. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4893.88s)]
*  I'm going to sign the extension with you here. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4895.240000000001s)]
*  And at one point, I think in the 26, 27 season, he was going to be the first [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4897.64s)]
*  $60 million player a year on the books. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4901.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4904.84s)]
*  So that's 26, 27. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4904.92s)]
*  We're still two years away from that season that was supposed to be on the [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4906.92s)]
*  books with some of these extensions. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4910.320000000001s)]
*  So he's turning all that stuff down. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4911.92s)]
*  Granted, he then gets frustrated with the nets and wants out, but these are the [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4913.200000000001s)]
*  numbers that he's expecting that he's in line for, and then he signs for two years [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4916.88s)]
*  and 68 and all of us are like, what the fuck? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4920.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4922.72s)]
*  He has a player option for the second year. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4924.4400000000005s)]
*  And remember the player option is like, wow, he's just going to opt out. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4927.64s)]
*  And then he's going to go back and get his four years, $200 million. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4930.040000000001s)]
*  No, he's not. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4933.88s)]
*  Cause now he's not getting the extension. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4935.28s)]
*  Now he's pissed. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4936.959999999999s)]
*  He ops in to control the trade market with this. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4937.759999999999s)]
*  He ops in. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4940.599999999999s)]
*  So that means he makes 68.6 million with the Sixers. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4941.5199999999995s)]
*  He signs the two year $70 million deal, this past free agency with the Clippers. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4945.599999999999s)]
*  So instead of those four years where he makes 138, he basically made about [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4949.719999999999s)]
*  70 million less over those four years. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4956.639999999999s)]
*  What if, what if the Sixers had just signed him? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4959.72s)]
*  Can we go backwards? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4964.4400000000005s)]
*  Because there's, you had so many what ifs in there. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4965.64s)]
*  What if he just signs with Houston and stays there? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4968.280000000001s)]
*  And then they kind of keep that going for another year before they realize [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4971.76s)]
*  they can't win a title instead of just blowing it up. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4975.120000000001s)]
*  I still don't love the trade they made, but it did blow them up. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4978.360000000001s)]
*  It allowed them to reset. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4980.96s)]
*  It allowed them to read the mobile green draft. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4982.240000000001s)]
*  If I remember they got picks out of it. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4984.200000000001s)]
*  They got calf space off of it. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4986.72s)]
*  They got calf space, all that stuff. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4988.44s)]
*  But then you go to the net. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4990.639999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I think it ended up being a blessing for Houston because it allowed [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4991.599999999999s)]
*  them to reset it sooner and now they're where they're at now. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4995.08s)]
*  Houston's in better shape. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4997.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4999.32s)]
*  Houston, Houston's totally fine with every way this is gone. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=4999.679999999999s)]
*  Works out for Houston. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5003.08s)]
*  Goes to the nets. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5004.2s)]
*  Nets give up all that stuff for them. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5005.28s)]
*  It's still haunting them to the point that they then just did that thing where [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5007.04s)]
*  they traded the Phoenix stuff to get back their own pick. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5011.2s)]
*  Which is his own conversation, which may have like, we'll see what happens there [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5014.88s)]
*  because those Phoenix picks, like, who knows? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5018.68s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5021.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5022.56s)]
*  But the other piece of that was when they finally have to get off hard and they [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5022.76s)]
*  trade for Ben Simmons, which turns out to be a catastrophe and they take Ben [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5026.08s)]
*  Simmons off Philly's hands. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5032.2s)]
*  They, they, they give them James Harden for Ben Simmons and like two first round [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5033.96s)]
*  picks that mean nothing. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5040.32s)]
*  And as much as you, you can, you can dislike Harden more than I dislike his [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5041.48s)]
*  playoff performances, but at that point, like Daryl, like where's the out? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5045.96s)]
*  Where's the out? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5052.04s)]
*  Like, how are you going to figure out? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5052.879999999999s)]
*  Like Daryl. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5054.0s)]
*  We both like the trade. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5054.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5056.92s)]
*  No, because at that point we're like, Hey, they can rejuvenate Ben Simmons. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5058.08s)]
*  It turns out to be a dejuvenation. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5062.12s)]
*  It just gets even worse. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5065.639999999999s)]
*  So then, and then with Philly, he screws, he screws them up where they finally have [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5068.56s)]
*  to get rid of them and then they have, you know, whatever happened to them last [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5073.12s)]
*  season, but then he goes to the Clippers and he allows them to get off the Paul [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5076.56s)]
*  George thing, which then retroactively kills Philly. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5080.56s)]
*  So he kills Philly and Brooklyn. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5083.92s)]
*  He did Houston a favor. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5087.92s)]
*  So let's, let's be fair about that one. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5089.16s)]
*  One out of three. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5091.36s)]
*  Right now he wanted out, but it ended up being the best thing that could have [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5092.12s)]
*  happened for them because they get to reset the clock, they get the picks and [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5095.92s)]
*  now, you know, you were doing a future roster draft, Houston's at least a top [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5098.92s)]
*  five pick, even with the question marks. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5103.16s)]
*  But he helps the Clippers because they get out of Paul George, they get [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5105.64s)]
*  hardened on a much better deal. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5108.32s)]
*  The Paul George stuff allows them to kind of reset all their apron shit. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5110.8s)]
*  Maybe Houston's a top seven future roster pick, as I'm kind of do it in my head [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5115.64s)]
*  real quick. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5118.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're top five. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5119.0s)]
*  But it's just the picks they have with the Phoenix picks. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5120.4800000000005s)]
*  It's why when you're like, okay, I'm in line for like 225 million. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5123.4400000000005s)]
*  In the summer of 22. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5128.72s)]
*  Again, just take it and figure it out later. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5131.4400000000005s)]
*  The numbers are, are interesting. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5133.400000000001s)]
*  But if, if Philly had just after he had done the first year at the discount and [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5135.52s)]
*  then they saw him play and then imagine like ownership's going, what, what was, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5141.24s)]
*  you know, they can argue it's been investigated. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5145.400000000001s)]
*  I'll still never believe that Harden just decided to do a two, a one plus one [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5148.12s)]
*  with a massive haircut, knowing it had already turned down 161 million, thinking [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5152.48s)]
*  he was in line for four years and 225 million. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5156.88s)]
*  It's like, no, I'll do two for 68, but I'll opt out next year. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5159.719999999999s)]
*  I just don't understand how a player or his reps would be like, we will do this [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5163.0s)]
*  and just see what happens. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5167.639999999999s)]
*  And then he doesn't play well in that Celtic series. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5168.88s)]
*  I know he was right in the beginning of the Celtic series, but it was just [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5171.96s)]
*  overall at that point, you're watching another year of Harden where you're going, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5174.32s)]
*  who would want to give him four years in the 200 million now? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5177.28s)]
*  And guess what? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5180.24s)]
*  The key point is he was so bad in six and seven, but there's another what if [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5181.72s)]
*  that ties to this. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5185.360000000001s)]
*  Cause he was awesome in earlier in the series to, to again, to be totally. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5185.88s)]
*  And then dies. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5189.04s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5189.68s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5190.320000000001s)]
*  But the other what if to this is they don't treat Harden well in this whole [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5191.04s)]
*  extension thing and it becomes a he said, she said thing. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5194.88s)]
*  Not great for Darryl, not great for the Sixers. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5198.64s)]
*  So they zag the other way with Embiid. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5201.92s)]
*  You know what? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5205.320000000001s)]
*  We're going to double down on Joel Embiid and show how much we love this guy with [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5206.96s)]
*  this massive extension on top of the two years we already owe him because we got [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5211.04s)]
*  to show that we love our players. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5215.6s)]
*  And that turns out to be a mistake. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5217.5199999999995s)]
*  James Harden, a lot of sliding doors and it could end up with the Clippers [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5219.76s)]
*  making the Western finals. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5223.72s)]
*  So we could be a sliding door number seven. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5225.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5228.2s)]
*  Because you'd imagine if Harden stays, there's a couple other things here too. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5228.4s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything for Embiid and his health, but they're better this year. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5232.24s)]
*  And that pick is definitely gone to OKC, but it's still not like an awful pick. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5236.28s)]
*  And by the way, they have the sixth worst record. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5242.2s)]
*  It's top six. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5244.28s)]
*  If there's one upset, Philly still losing that pick. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5245.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5248.08s)]
*  It's like, it's basically 50, 50 or 60, 40, depending on where they are. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5248.36s)]
*  Even if they get to the five spot, it's still like 60, 40 that they keep it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5252.88s)]
*  So it's not even like, oh, we got the five spot. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5257.2s)]
*  We're keeping the pick. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5259.32s)]
*  Nope. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5260.16s)]
*  They change the odds. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5260.72s)]
*  You're not keeping it. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5261.679999999999s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5262.44s)]
*  Or because Harden isn't there to probably have them set up for a much better [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5263.08s)]
*  regular season, because if he's playing, he's putting up numbers. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5268.6s)]
*  Maybe they get the third pick. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5272.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5274.04s)]
*  So maybe the best part of this, maybe it's Paul George staying with the Clippers [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5274.52s)]
*  because they don't have the Harden option. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5278.92s)]
*  Would the Clippers be better or worse? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5280.92s)]
*  You know, depending on George's availability, I don't know that there's [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5283.4800000000005s)]
*  much of an argument you can make in it. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5286.72s)]
*  Anyway, that one's endless. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5287.8s)]
*  It just is a cycle. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5289.52s)]
*  It's a fever dream. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5290.68s)]
*  Well, I have another one that's endless. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5292.52s)]
*  Ready? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5294.0s)]
*  What if Dallas just gives Jalen Brunson a four year 55 extension during [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5295.320000000001s)]
*  the summer of 2021 or even during the 21, 22 season, it leads to no Jalen [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5299.16s)]
*  Brunson in New York, no Kyrie to Dallas. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5305.04s)]
*  Maybe Lucas stays because him and Jalen Brunson are so awesome together. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5308.320000000001s)]
*  Um, New York ends up trading everything for Donovan Mitchell who wanted to play [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5312.52s)]
*  in New York for a couple of years there before realizing those doors were closed. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5317.68s)]
*  So now we don't have the Cleveland thing either because the Knicks have traded [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5321.2s)]
*  seven first round picks and God only knows what else to get Mitchell. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5324.88s)]
*  Bridges does, Bridges doesn't go to the Knicks. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5328.64s)]
*  Maybe he goes somewhere else, whatever. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5331.4800000000005s)]
*  The 2025 Cavs don't happen. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5333.56s)]
*  It's got 19 different things, but then also leads to sliding door to be. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5336.04s)]
*  Does Dallas even trade Luke at that point? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5341.44s)]
*  And then the second part of this is what if Dallas just leaks in mid-January that [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5344.8s)]
*  they're thinking about trading Luca, how do the next two weeks play out? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5349.48s)]
*  Shams reports. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5354.0s)]
*  I'm hearing the Dallas approach Minnesota about Anthony Edwards to see it, but, and [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5357.959999999999s)]
*  it's just, and then the Dallas fan base reacts and we're off and I don't think [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5364.28s)]
*  there's any way he gets traded, but if he does get traded, it's for a way crazier [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5368.919999999999s)]
*  price than what they got. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5372.799999999999s)]
*  So I think those two are tied together because neither of them are now in [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5374.0s)]
*  the Dallas Mavericks. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5376.839999999999s)]
*  Is there a discussion about who would you rather have if you were the [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5380.16s)]
*  Knicks, Mitchell or Brunson? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5383.919999999999s)]
*  Well, the answer is Brunson because the price they gave up for Brunson versus [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5388.12s)]
*  the price they would have had to give up for Mitchell. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5393.599999999999s)]
*  It's no contest. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5395.599999999999s)]
*  If you're saying just fundamentally, who would you rather have? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5396.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, let's not talk in the fact that Brunson gave him a massive discount, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5399.24s)]
*  which again is another one of those. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5402.04s)]
*  I'd personally, I'd like slightly lean toward Brunson for me, but I also think [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5404.2s)]
*  Tibbs is running Brunson into the ground in a real way and there's a chance maybe [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5411.5199999999995s)]
*  Mitchell would have been better off playing for Tibbs than Brunson. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5416.04s)]
*  I think what they're doing to Brunson is nuts. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5419.0s)]
*  I've been pretty consistent with it. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5421.96s)]
*  He finally got hurt. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5423.5199999999995s)]
*  Was it, you know, he stepped on somebody's ankle. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5424.4s)]
*  It wasn't Tibbs fault, but I just think running small guys into the ground like [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5426.12s)]
*  that, there's no recipe in the history of the league that that's a good idea. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5429.96s)]
*  Um, it's, it almost feels like Brunson, you know, it's like recasting a movie. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5438.68s)]
*  It's like trying to take like, Hey, could you have done Dumb and Dumber [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5445.76s)]
*  with Jeff Daniels and Paul Rudd? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5448.56s)]
*  Well, no, I can't unsee Jim Perry being perfect. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5451.76s)]
*  Like there's, there's no way. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5456.76s)]
*  So undoing what we've seen with Brunson and what he's meant to Nick's fans. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5457.72s)]
*  Cause I imagine as I asked that question, Nick's fans are listening to be like, are [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5461.84s)]
*  you out of your mind? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5464.6s)]
*  Like Brunson's are, and I'm not telling you, you're wrong. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5465.52s)]
*  I probably lean a little slight Mitchell, but I don't think many people would agree [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5468.64s)]
*  with me just because you've seen how special this Brunson Nick's thing has been. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5472.56s)]
*  How many huge shots he's been involved in, you know, his network of people [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5477.04s)]
*  that want to play for him. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5482.84s)]
*  I was, I went to Laker game with the Nick fan last night and we were both [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5484.08s)]
*  looking around at all the jerseys, right? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5487.56s)]
*  And the Manicoby jerseys that are still at Lakers games. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5489.400000000001s)]
*  Now all the little kids have Luca jerseys and there's the LeBron jerseys and you'll [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5492.080000000001s)]
*  see some shacks and you'll see some old school Jerry West. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5496.360000000001s)]
*  Like it's, it's all in California guys with Reeves jerseys on. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5499.68s)]
*  There are a couple Reeves jerseys for Orange County. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5503.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, but, uh, I asked my Nick's fans friends, I asked my Nick's fans friend, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5506.4400000000005s)]
*  what are the jerseys like at Nick's games? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5513.200000000001s)]
*  And he's like Brunson. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5515.0s)]
*  It's just people fucking love Brunson. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5515.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5517.72s)]
*  That's kind of the point is. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5518.4400000000005s)]
*  Then he was like, there's a couple towns, but it's kind of the zag. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5519.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, it's like when, when the 2002 that when there was like a lot of Pierce [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5524.28s)]
*  jerseys and then somebody would zag with the Antoine Jersey. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5528.24s)]
*  Like, oh, I understand the Antoine Jersey. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5532.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5534.0s)]
*  He was there before and he was the higher pick and it was like, okay, this guy [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5534.24s)]
*  can do a little everything. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5538.400000000001s)]
*  Jordan's talking them up. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5539.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5541.08s)]
*  But yeah, he said there's a whiff of towns, but it's like, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5541.96s)]
*  I just think New York just loves Brunson. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5544.4s)]
*  So anyway, that, uh, the Dallas thing, the Brunson piece of it, when it was so [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5546.599999999999s)]
*  obvious, like that just wasn't a lot of money and they should have done it. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5550.96s)]
*  And then they almost did it again during the season and both times backed off. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5554.0s)]
*  I think you look at Cuban the last couple of years and I'm not saying it [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5558.48s)]
*  undid the 2011 title because that was amazing, but his decade, that's, that's [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5563.08s)]
*  a little too harsh. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5568.28s)]
*  His decade is fucking brutal. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5569.08s)]
*  Like not doing the Brunson thing, selling the team to these schmucks that trade [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5571.5199999999995s)]
*  Luka within a year and then not getting nearly enough for the team, not to mention [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5575.44s)]
*  all the behind the shit stuff, behind the scenes shit that was going on with that [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5579.8s)]
*  organization, rough decade for our guy cubes just, and now he's trying to [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5583.16s)]
*  distance himself desperately from the Luka trade and he'll do any interview and [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5588.8s)]
*  talk about how he can't believe and oh my God, I had no idea. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5593.24s)]
*  It's like, you did it. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5596.2s)]
*  You did it. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5597.44s)]
*  You did it. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5598.12s)]
*  You did it. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5598.719999999999s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5599.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, you did sell the team to these dudes. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5600.16s)]
*  This is your fault. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5603.32s)]
*  Just like it was Howard Schultz's fault when he sold the Sonics to these fucking [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5604.639999999999s)]
*  dudes from Oklahoma city who were clearly going to move them. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5609.12s)]
*  Cuban sold the Mavericks to these guys and they obviously don't know what they're [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5612.36s)]
*  doing and they traded Luka Donchich, which is the most insane thing that's [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5616.48s)]
*  happened in the NBA this century. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5619.839999999999s)]
*  Other than maybe the art test may live. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5621.88s)]
*  Hey, just full transparency. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5623.599999999999s)]
*  Have you tried to get him on? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5625.16s)]
*  No. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5627.48s)]
*  I had him on a couple of years ago. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5627.92s)]
*  You haven't requested him on recently. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5630.76s)]
*  No. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5633.36s)]
*  Last year. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5633.56s)]
*  Why? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5634.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, I thought maybe with the cell phone. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5635.4800000000005s)]
*  Should we have him on together? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5636.68s)]
*  I honestly, I don't want to, I'm not that interested in somebody giving interviews [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5638.16s)]
*  about how they wouldn't have traded Luka Donchich if they still on the team. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5641.8s)]
*  It's like, well, you sold the team. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5644.72s)]
*  I want to stay on this. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5647.24s)]
*  Why'd you sell the team? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5647.84s)]
*  I know we're doing sliding doors, but we need to stay on this because there's a [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5648.76s)]
*  bunch of things that you said that I totally agree with, but I've also noticed [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5652.28s)]
*  the podcast that he's going on. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5655.2s)]
*  Is he going on with podcasts, knowing that sports guys that know the story a [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5657.64s)]
*  little bit better wouldn't hammer him on it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5662.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5664.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5664.8s)]
*  Cause it's like, Hey, when you sold the team again, if the Mavs go for 4 [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5665.12s)]
*  billion in Dallas, wasn't 4 billion. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5668.68s)]
*  It was three and a half. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5672.12s)]
*  It was like, it might've been less. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5674.04s)]
*  But if the Celtics go for 6.1, the Mavs should have gone for higher. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5676.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5680.0s)]
*  It's my point. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5680.48s)]
*  They own their arena. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5682.12s)]
*  It's a top eight or nine market in the league and they had Luca [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5683.04s)]
*  Dancic who's worth a billion dollars by himself for value. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5686.6s)]
*  No question. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5690.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5691.68s)]
*  And then which so many NBA teams, and I just heard McMahon on with [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5692.04s)]
*  Winhorse and Bontemps on this. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5696.84s)]
*  And he was talking about just the wording of the transition of the [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5698.4400000000005s)]
*  front office of like, okay, this group is buying it, but I am going to run this [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5704.68s)]
*  team and there's all these very specific quotes about how. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5710.0s)]
*  Cuban's going to keep running it. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5714.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5715.4s)]
*  Was that to a fan base? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5715.8s)]
*  Nobody believed it. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5717.64s)]
*  There were other teams who actually was in basketball circles, believed that [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5718.72s)]
*  that's how it was going to be played out. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5722.44s)]
*  And by the way, we're going through the same thing now with, with [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5723.76s)]
*  Wick and the new owner, unless that's in writing that he is going to be the [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5726.64s)]
*  governor for the next three years. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5730.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's part of the sale. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5731.84s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to last two years, one year. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5733.24s)]
*  I have no, we have no idea. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5735.32s)]
*  But see that's, I want to stay on that. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5736.84s)]
*  Cause this is exactly where I wanted to go because. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5738.76s)]
*  McMahon was using like quotes and they were all like, they all sound ridiculous. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5741.88s)]
*  Listen a year later of Cuba go, okay, this is how it's going to be handled. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5746.360000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, I'm going to run all these different things. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5750.2s)]
*  And as I made fun of it in the moment on this podcast, and there were so [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5752.16s)]
*  many people around the NBA being like, why does he keep saying this? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5755.320000000001s)]
*  Like this is definitely not going to happen. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5757.96s)]
*  And it's exactly how it played out. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5760.4800000000005s)]
*  So when the Celtics sale was announced, which I want to ask you more about the [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5762.08s)]
*  first thing I thought about in that press release was I wonder what isn't true. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5766.92s)]
*  Now, maybe they're telling the truth. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5770.56s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5772.2s)]
*  And I still think despite some of the blips that you're, you're hammering [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5773.32s)]
*  Cuban here for, I think it's a, it's a much better track record than a lot of [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5776.4800000000005s)]
*  the other options that you've had. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5781.0s)]
*  But you'd look at long-term ownership. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5782.6s)]
*  There's no way you're giving Cuban a failing grade at owning the mass. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5785.2s)]
*  No, I think he's one of the most important NBA owners of the 21st century. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5788.4800000000005s)]
*  He's in the top three and he had a great, great first two decades. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5793.68s)]
*  I'm just saying the, the stretch here, starting with Brunson to the end. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5797.6s)]
*  It's really bad for him. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5802.320000000001s)]
*  It gets mentioned in the first paragraph of everything about this. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5803.4400000000005s)]
*  And Jaylen Brunson signing with the Knicks is not in the first paragraph [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5807.6s)]
*  or whatever, no, I'm saying what happened to the Mavs over the course to where [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5811.92s)]
*  they are now, where their fan base is in a full revolt with the team. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5815.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5819.96s)]
*  He's got to get some blame for that. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5821.0s)]
*  He does. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5822.68s)]
*  And don't sell the team to these people who obviously didn't know what they were [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5823.72s)]
*  doing if, you know, and then be like, ah, I never would have traded them. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5827.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, I thought you loved the Mavericks. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5831.360000000001s)]
*  I thought you loved their fans. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5833.52s)]
*  I thought you loved Luca. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5834.68s)]
*  Like that's crazy. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5835.68s)]
*  That's crazy to say that after the fact, you have to take some blame. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5836.6s)]
*  I should have vetted these guys better. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5840.400000000001s)]
*  I wish I hadn't sold the team. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5842.320000000001s)]
*  He didn't do any of it. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5844.68s)]
*  He's just been like, ah, I never would have done it. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5845.84s)]
*  Cool. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5847.88s)]
*  Guess what? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5849.12s)]
*  You don't have Luca Donsche anymore. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5849.6s)]
*  Or the Mavs. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5852.0s)]
*  There are some memes going around that are like a reminder of Mike [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5853.320000000001s)]
*  Torico's greatest lesson that he ever shared with me was the points you don't [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5857.52s)]
*  make make the points you do make that much stronger, which is still something [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5862.4400000000005s)]
*  I struggle with, but it's really good. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5865.64s)]
*  Like if you have one, one point, like sell it, but don't sell it with point [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5867.12s)]
*  five, six, seven, that aren't really as strong and almost hurt the strength of [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5874.280000000001s)]
*  one, two, three, and four to hammer home your point. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5880.04s)]
*  So, Hey, Lucas gone. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5882.5599999999995s)]
*  So it was like the Mavs fumble. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5884.12s)]
*  Have you seen this meme? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5885.679999999999s)]
*  So it's Luca and then it's Brunson and then it's Grimes who singlehandedly [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5886.799999999999s)]
*  is like screwing up some of these lottery odds for the sixes, but then it's [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5893.96s)]
*  Prezengis who, by the way, they couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5897.32s)]
*  All right. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5900.4s)]
*  Do you do that trade again? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5900.88s)]
*  Derek Jones Jr. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5902.599999999999s)]
*  Was over there and you're like, okay, well, I mean, you know, he's, he's a nice [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5904.2s)]
*  player, but there's just some dudes in that picture where I'm like, actually [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5909.84s)]
*  you're, you're kind of ruining the point, but you just thought it would look better [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5914.12s)]
*  with seven players instead of just three. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5916.72s)]
*  Uh, do you, do you believe the transition plan for the Celtics and WIC? [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5918.4400000000005s)]
*  Cause I could see where a group comes in and goes WIC has been, again, I think [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5922.96s)]
*  with on that short list, we know that he's cared, we know that I think he gets [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5927.360000000001s)]
*  it in the way that fans would want your owner to get it. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5931.64s)]
*  They have always spent money when they've had to spend money. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5934.2s)]
*  They're staring down the barrel of this massive tax bill, which I think it'd be [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5937.04s)]
*  sort of weird for WIC to go like, Hey, now that you have to pay this bill, I [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5940.2s)]
*  would recommend not trading any of these players and keeping this window open. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5943.76s)]
*  Let's give Kade a 10 million a year. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5947.16s)]
*  No, here's what I believe. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5949.64s)]
*  I think it's very possible. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5951.8s)]
*  And I don't know for sure that part of the conditions when they got to the final [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5953.360000000001s)]
*  four, we're like, we're going to consider the bids or favor the bids that WIC is [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5957.92s)]
*  in there for three years as, as the governor and the transition. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5962.84s)]
*  And if you can get to like 6 billion and you have that in there, you're [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5966.88s)]
*  going to have a better chance. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5969.72s)]
*  And there might've been some of the other bids that were like, all right, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5971.4400000000005s)]
*  our offer is five, eight, and we take over the team immediately. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5974.16s)]
*  Um, I just don't know if that's in there or not. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5978.08s)]
*  And I don't know if this is Cuban 2.0 or like, no, no, he's going to run the team. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5980.8s)]
*  And then nine months from now, the new guys like, Hey WIC, um, I took your [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5984.4800000000005s)]
*  courtside seats, so I moved you over. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5992.280000000001s)]
*  You're going to be in a suite from now on and all this stuff that happened to [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5994.360000000001s)]
*  Cuban, we knew the Cuban thing was done. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5996.36s)]
*  And I can't remember if we talked about or not when he wasn't involved with the [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=5998.4s)]
*  Western conference trophy presentation and all that stuff. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6002.28s)]
*  And then there was stuff that you were hearing during the finals about. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6005.799999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't let them sit, you know, they wouldn't give them the courtsides. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6009.2s)]
*  He was scrambling to sit courtside and the team only gets two and there was [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6011.96s)]
*  just a lot of buzz that, Oh, he didn't play this one correctly. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6016.599999999999s)]
*  Um, I don't know what the [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6020.599999999999s)]
*  Or it was, or it was played the way it's supposed to be played. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6022.28s)]
*  Is it when somebody writes you a check for billions that [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6025.839999999999s)]
*  guess what they want to own the team. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6028.92s)]
*  That's why I have no idea what, what, uh, where we're going with the Celtics. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6030.24s)]
*  Um, what was your last sliding door? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6034.0s)]
*  Cause we're almost done with this segment. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6036.36s)]
*  If Lucas drafted by Atlanta and he stays with the Hawks, does that [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6039.5199999999995s)]
*  mean no Dyson Daniels? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6043.4s)]
*  I didn't know you had a Luca one. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6046.5599999999995s)]
*  So I had another Luca one with Atlanta. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6047.839999999999s)]
*  I don't know how different it really is. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6050.04s)]
*  He's probably still on Atlanta. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6051.599999999999s)]
*  Trey is with Dallas. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6053.5199999999995s)]
*  They likely don't have a finals run in 24. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6055.2s)]
*  Um, but I don't know. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6058.04s)]
*  Uh, that one's not nearly as exciting as the Luca one that you did with everything [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6062.64s)]
*  else. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6065.64s)]
*  So why don't you just share your last one that you think I'll just [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6065.88s)]
*  rip through really quick. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6068.08s)]
*  The, what if Dame goes to Miami is fun because it has, it has a [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6070.12s)]
*  whole bunch of ramifications. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6074.5599999999995s)]
*  Miami offered hero, Lowry and 28 and 31st. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6076.08s)]
*  Phoenix. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6081.2s)]
*  If this all happens, Phoenix, the, the Deandre Aitin and Kamara for a [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6082.12s)]
*  Nurkic and Alan that trade doesn't happen. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6087.64s)]
*  Eight and eight and trade probably happens though. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6091.04s)]
*  Rip, but I'm not positive Grayson Allen's in it because that was part of like, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6094.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, trying to get Dame and they had to move money off and put Grayson [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6099.64s)]
*  Allen somewhere, who knows the bucks. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6103.76s)]
*  Don't lose drew to the Celtics. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6105.76s)]
*  They get a 29 first and swaps in 28 and 30. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6109.72s)]
*  Um, Portland, Portland ends up getting, they trade drew to Boston for [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6116.52s)]
*  Brogdon Williams, a 24 Golden state first and a 29 Boston first. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6122.32s)]
*  Basically what I wrote down is every team is worse off except Portland and [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6127.36s)]
*  Boston, the bucks are worse off with what, with Dame and the fact that it [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6131.400000000001s)]
*  didn't elevate them the way they thought. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6136.2s)]
*  Even though Dame's been, I think good this year. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6137.88s)]
*  Dame's been better offensively this year. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6140.0s)]
*  Uh, there's no comparison. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6142.400000000001s)]
*  I test wise. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6144.4400000000005s)]
*  He's looked really good. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6145.2s)]
*  Uh, stats are good. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6146.12s)]
*  Heat are way worse off. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6147.320000000001s)]
*  Phoenix is worse off. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6149.72s)]
*  Um, so yeah, it's, it's just a weird one. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6152.52s)]
*  I think it helped the Celtics win the title is the biggest sliding door from that. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6156.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6160.28s)]
*  Let's, let's stay. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6160.84s)]
*  What if they do the Miami deal? [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6161.76s)]
*  Does that mean Butler gets extended? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6164.92s)]
*  Does it mean that Miami's still in the mix? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6166.44s)]
*  Does it mean that Butler's happy? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6168.36s)]
*  Does it mean that Golden state has no other option? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6169.839999999999s)]
*  You know, I think if you do that Dame trade, you then have to do the extension [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6172.879999999999s)]
*  with Jimmy because you can't do all of that and then not have a relationship. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6176.36s)]
*  You don't think Miami wouldn't just like, Hey, we'll just run it to pre-agency. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6181.36s)]
*  See what's out there for you. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6185.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6188.2s)]
*  I don't think you can, you can't give up all that for Dame and be like, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6189.04s)]
*  we're trying to win right now. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6191.839999999999s)]
*  Also, I didn't factor in whatever happened to Bam out of bio in the last year. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6193.6s)]
*  What happened? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6198.72s)]
*  Why isn't he an impactful top 20 guy anymore? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6200.92s)]
*  Does if Dame's on that team, is he? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6204.8s)]
*  Well, having another like all NBA, not that Dame's making all NBA this year, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6209.56s)]
*  but, um, having somebody like his, his shop making would certainly help a lot [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6213.32s)]
*  easier right now. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6218.64s)]
*  I know there's. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6220.36s)]
*  Bam better. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6220.68s)]
*  It makes Butler if he's happy and they took care of an extension and they might [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6221.52s)]
*  be a contender. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6225.4400000000005s)]
*  So that's a good one. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6226.12s)]
*  Um, yeah, I think there's some assumptions in that though. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6227.280000000001s)]
*  Like what if Dame comes in, gets his 30, isn't playing defense and becomes a son [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6230.400000000001s)]
*  situation. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6236.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's not really like, you just assumed a lot about what they would [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6237.6s)]
*  be doing in the East. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6243.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6245.360000000001s)]
*  I think they would have taken care of Butler in that scenario. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6246.64s)]
*  So I feel like it's two guys. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6249.12s)]
*  Not all right. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6250.68s)]
*  Fine. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6251.4s)]
*  Then let's say it's, it's Butler and Dame with Bam, no hero. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6251.84s)]
*  Is that a top six team in the East right now? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6256.64s)]
*  I think they might've thought it was, but you're right. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6265.5599999999995s)]
*  It might've been a son situation where the league got way deeper and this recipe [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6268.72s)]
*  you had for a big three didn't make as much sense in 25 as it did now. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6272.48s)]
*  I think it would have helped them more last year. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6277.24s)]
*  Also might help them get some, some, some buyout dudes and who knows? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6279.12s)]
*  I think that would add struggle, trouble against Boston. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6286.08s)]
*  A couple more quick ones. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6290.32s)]
*  What if Fishby doesn't have new owner syndrome? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6291.92s)]
*  Because he did that KD for Bridges, KM Crowder, four first and a swap. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6296.24s)]
*  Um, it also led to the second Beale trade, which saved, he basically saved [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6302.4s)]
*  Washington and saved Brooklyn with those two trades. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6306.4s)]
*  So that's gotta be thrown in there. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6308.6s)]
*  What if the adoka scandal never happens? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6310.6s)]
*  Do the Celtics win in 23? [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6314.52s)]
*  What happens to the Rockets? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6317.52s)]
*  Does any of this even matter? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6319.0s)]
*  Did it all play out exactly the way it should have played out? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6320.400000000001s)]
*  Is he still second row Joe to you guys? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6322.68s)]
*  He might be third row Joe. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6325.320000000001s)]
*  Um, what if Danny just doesn't blow up the jazz in 22 coming off of 49 33 season [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6327.4400000000005s)]
*  when they lost to Dallas because Luca was hurt half the series, but Brunson went [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6334.240000000001s)]
*  nuts and it seemed like, what is this? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6337.64s)]
*  This team's broken. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6339.8s)]
*  Jaylen Brunson just let them up, but nobody knew who was Jaylen Brunson yet. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6340.72s)]
*  And then they ended up making those two massive trades to Cleveland and to [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6344.68s)]
*  Minnesota and basically create these new, you know, real contenders for two other [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6348.04s)]
*  teams. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6354.280000000001s)]
*  Mitchell would have started getting loud. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6355.84s)]
*  I think at some point, I don't think that was going to be up to just Utah. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6357.280000000001s)]
*  What if gold state takes Lamello and Franz in those two drafts? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6362.64s)]
*  Again, stupid. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6366.88s)]
*  No, it isn't stupid. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6368.5199999999995s)]
*  Cause I know, but I mean, it's like, this is like in a drive. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6369.4s)]
*  You can do this and all the time, but it is, there is this alternate universe [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6371.639999999999s)]
*  where they take Lamello and they take Franz. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6374.679999999999s)]
*  Did they win the 22 title at that point? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6378.36s)]
*  Maybe they don't. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6380.2s)]
*  Are they better now? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6380.88s)]
*  Maybe they are. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6381.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6382.36s)]
*  It's just, it's like steps like I'm done. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6383.08s)]
*  I'm out. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6386.28s)]
*  Does the Mello fit in their system? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6387.96s)]
*  Do they trade them within a year? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6389.44s)]
*  Does Lamello does a well, does he actually look like a future hall of [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6390.88s)]
*  fame or 16, 17 a game wide open threes all the time? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6394.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6398.08s)]
*  Passing over the top. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6398.36s)]
*  Like could Lamello actually, I know he's a stat filling guy, but would he look [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6399.16s)]
*  like a really nice, complimentary fun winning player? [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6404.28s)]
*  I will say coming over Franz, which I think was argued really extensively [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6409.759999999999s)]
*  and golden state side. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6415.639999999999s)]
*  And the whole case for Franz was he's an IQ guy. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6416.96s)]
*  He's movement. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6420.16s)]
*  He can fits into what we do. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6420.88s)]
*  That, that just would have been a better pick for them. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6421.92s)]
*  I had Bob Myers on and talked about that pick after and then was like, who [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6425.04s)]
*  would you have taken then? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6429.16s)]
*  Cause I was like, it's just comminga felt like the competition he was going up [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6430.72s)]
*  against and he was like, well, who would you have taken? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6435.2s)]
*  I go, it's totally unfair for me to say like after Franz has had the start to [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6439.16s)]
*  his career that, Oh, you should have taken Franz. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6442.76s)]
*  So we came to some kind of agreement with that, but I think it's a lot like these [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6445.12s)]
*  conversations that the guys will have. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6449.0s)]
*  And they go, okay, but if it's a lot like the Jaylen Brown thing with [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6450.32s)]
*  H if with this body type and this kind of athleticism, is there enough there [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6453.08s)]
*  that we see that we can build on that this could be like a really special [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6457.92s)]
*  perimeter player where you're taking him. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6461.24s)]
*  That's what I think breaks a lot of ties in these war rooms. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6463.52s)]
*  And then we look back being like, how do those guys fuck that one up? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6465.84s)]
*  I think they finally realized that the, that they, as long as Steph and [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6468.68s)]
*  J-Mart run the team hoops IQ had to be the number one thing. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6472.72s)]
*  Maybe they struggled with that for a couple of years. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6476.88s)]
*  Uh, two more quick ones. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6478.72s)]
*  This is just a funny one. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6479.68s)]
*  What are you saying about Wasman and Kaminga? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6481.120000000001s)]
*  What if COVID never happened? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6483.4800000000005s)]
*  And I went back and I looked at the standings and I remembered and actually [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6486.120000000001s)]
*  listened to like 10 minutes of a pod we did that Sunday before COVID of Lake, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6489.080000000001s)]
*  the Lakers finally beat the Quippers. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6493.72s)]
*  And we did a pod about what does this mean to the Lakers and say, like, but [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6497.0s)]
*  the Quippers had already beaten them twice, but the Lakers when COVID happens, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6501.080000000001s)]
*  the Lakers are 49 and 14. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6505.72s)]
*  They're number one in the West. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6507.52s)]
*  The Quippers are 44 and 20 and the nuggets are 43 and 22. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6509.0s)]
*  So the, and those are going to be our three teams, basically. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6513.8s)]
*  Milwaukee was 53 and 12 and Giannis was about to win his second MVP. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6516.84s)]
*  And Milwaukee, I just forgot this. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6523.56s)]
*  Milwaukee was like, that was the big obstacle. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6525.6s)]
*  That was the one. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6528.56s)]
*  And then it was like LA versus LA. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6529.400000000001s)]
*  And then here's Giannis over here. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6531.280000000001s)]
*  And what, how is this going to play out? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6533.04s)]
*  And COVID happens, they come back and Giannis gets hurt in the first round. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6535.04s)]
*  And that's how Miami jumps in. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6538.96s)]
*  The Quippers completely fall apart in the bubble. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6540.72s)]
*  So COVID never happens. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6543.8s)]
*  I don't know what happens that season, but it's probably Milwaukee or the two LA [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6545.6s)]
*  teams, I think the title comes from one of those three, I think it would have been [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6548.84s)]
*  way better for the Quippers. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6553.08s)]
*  Um, here's my last one. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6555.200000000001s)]
*  This is just for you. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6557.200000000001s)]
*  Cause I, this is like the ultimate dumb slide indoor thing. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6558.0s)]
*  What if Philly doesn't bail on Al Horford after one year? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6561.4400000000005s)]
*  Uh, it was such a bad fit though with Embiid. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6564.64s)]
*  It just, it just didn't work. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6569.6s)]
*  So can I give you the trades? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6571.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6573.64s)]
*  Cause they had to get all this pick by the way, that we talked about before. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6573.88s)]
*  November, November, 2020 coming out of the bubble season, heading to the next [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6577.72s)]
*  season, Darrell has just taken over and Horford's got three years left on his deal. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6582.320000000001s)]
*  They trade him with Maladon, Meachich and a 25 first for Danny Green. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6587.32s)]
*  That was the trade. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6596.8s)]
*  They put OKC, they put OKC puts Horford on ice for a year. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6598.88s)]
*  They trade him to the Celtics for Kemba in the 16th pick. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6603.84s)]
*  What happens to the 16th pick? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6609.32s)]
*  They pass on Shen Goon and Trey Murphy with the pick they get from [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6611.84s)]
*  Horford and traded to Houston for two heavily protected Detroit, Washington [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6615.68s)]
*  picks that was kind of a bad trade, but they just could have taken Shen Goon or [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6620.52s)]
*  Trey Murphy Celtics make the 22 finals with Horford. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6625.4800000000005s)]
*  They win the 24th title with Horford and Philly is now tanking in 25 to keep this [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6629.04s)]
*  pick that they gave up because they decided Al Horford was a bad fit with Joe [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6634.52s)]
*  Ellen Bede who doesn't fucking play. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6639.200000000001s)]
*  Guess who needed a backup center for Joe Ellen Bede. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6641.84s)]
*  Tough one. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6645.84s)]
*  Tough one, but it was ugly and you felt like at the time it was worth moving. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6648.68s)]
*  They had to do something. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6651.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6652.360000000001s)]
*  Cause it was crazy. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6652.76s)]
*  Is that Al Horford had negative value? [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6653.6s)]
*  They're like, you gotta take, if you take Al Horford, I need, I need, I, you also [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6656.6s)]
*  have to throw in a pick, you got to take this guy back. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6662.56s)]
*  That's how bad it was. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6666.52s)]
*  And now he's like one of the most beloved Celtic teammates probably ever. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6667.52s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6671.4800000000005s)]
*  Cause it's two transactions there where it's a negative because you're [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6671.76s)]
*  getting off a Kemba's disastrous thing, but you're including the pick to take him back. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6675.36s)]
*  I'm just so glad that Al got that second act in Boston because it was this. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6680.12s)]
*  Deal where, you know, he's just not going to be appreciated the right way when [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6686.0s)]
*  he signed it a max contract, but it's so hard to sign any free agents. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6688.92s)]
*  Like you should be thrilled, especially at the time and age that Horford was at. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6691.88s)]
*  It's like, you can get this guy like, I hope he says yes to our max offer. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6696.04s)]
*  And then, you know, look, the counting stats aren't going to be good enough for [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6699.679999999999s)]
*  a lot of fans when it's Al Horford and then for him to extend it this far, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6703.12s)]
*  like even a couple of years ago, I was like, when is this thing going to be over? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6708.96s)]
*  Can you really ask to run him this way? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6712.24s)]
*  And I mean, thank God for Horford. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6715.4s)]
*  Cause without him, I really wonder what they would look like to have, you know, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6717.8s)]
*  have that kind of insurance against Przingus where you need, you need somebody [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6721.28s)]
*  who's really good to play all those games that you know, Przingus is going to miss. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6724.96s)]
*  You know, it would have been a fun, I mentioned, forgot to mention one other [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6729.76s)]
*  what if with this, the, if the, the Horford shade doesn't exist for the Celtics, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6732.32s)]
*  they're stuck with Kemba for one more year, but they take Trey Murphy with the 16th [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6736.36s)]
*  pick who's kind of like the perfect interchangeable swing to come in. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6741.4s)]
*  And like that, that's another one. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6747.16s)]
*  But what ifs, those are our favorite ones. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6748.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, somehow we went for almost two hours, so we don't have to do the [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6752.4s)]
*  thing at the top of the podcast. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6755.599999999999s)]
*  I think we're good with the pod March madness. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6756.88s)]
*  I'm sure you're enjoying it. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6759.2s)]
*  Um, not really. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6761.0s)]
*  Not really. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6762.48s)]
*  No, not with St. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6763.48s)]
*  John's most anticipation I've had for St. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6764.4s)]
*  John's in 25 years. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6766.28s)]
*  I already told that story about St. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6768.2s)]
*  John's last Sunday. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6769.4s)]
*  Uh, I did not leave my apartment and leave guests behind this time around. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6770.44s)]
*  I knew that shooting thing was probably going to really hurt him. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6774.88s)]
*  I didn't expect that it was going to happen in the second game against Arkansas, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6778.2s)]
*  but Lewis was just really bad and you could even see at some point edge of [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6781.92s)]
*  fork grab them and be like, you need to wake up, you need to wake up. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6785.84s)]
*  So I think on the whole, you need to look at it this way. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6788.48s)]
*  If you're a St. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6791.08s)]
*  John's fan, you've had nothing to be this excited about for a quarter century. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6791.5599999999995s)]
*  Patino is everything and that as advertised considering he's [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6795.88s)]
*  won everywhere he's gone. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6799.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's disappointing, but they won the big East. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6801.2s)]
*  They beat you con twice. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6803.36s)]
*  They're back on the map. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6804.84s)]
*  They're likely only going to get better until Patino probably gets back into like, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6806.44s)]
*  you know, who knows what job is open to him. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6810.88s)]
*  You never know. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6813.16s)]
*  Cause Patino will just take them. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6813.639999999999s)]
*  But if he's content wants to stay in St. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6814.8s)]
*  John's, I think that they'll be even better. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6816.56s)]
*  So it was a really fun season for a program that, you know, at some point [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6819.4800000000005s)]
*  during every year when I would watch him, I wouldn't really talk about it all that [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6823.4400000000005s)]
*  much. I just wanted to enjoy it as a fan. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6825.88s)]
*  Cause there's very few things that I still have in my life that are just about, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6827.320000000001s)]
*  Hey, this is going to be a fan experience. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6830.52s)]
*  I don't really have to talk about it. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6831.92s)]
*  Not breaking down St. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6833.0s)]
*  John's after a bunch of those games. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6833.76s)]
*  It brought me so much joy this year to feel like you were a part of it again, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6835.56s)]
*  the way I did when I was a kid, the way I was in college, the way I was in my [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6840.96s)]
*  twenties, um, that there's just too many positives for me to be too upset about [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6843.64s)]
*  losing to Arkansas. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6848.4800000000005s)]
*  Cause they also can't shoot. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6850.64s)]
*  They were like three forties out of 364 teams. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6852.08s)]
*  So you knew this game was coming again. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6854.240000000001s)]
*  I didn't think it'd be after one round, but [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6855.8s)]
*  do you think he should have done the press conference after and done the [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6858.360000000001s)]
*  Chris Mullins not walking through that door, St. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6861.4400000000005s)]
*  John's fans, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6863.280000000001s)]
*  Bill, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6865.360000000001s)]
*  William Glass walking through that door, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6865.56s)]
*  Walter Barrett is not walking through that door. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6868.160000000001s)]
*  And if he did, he'd be old and gray. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6869.84s)]
*  I would imagine a lot of guys are going to be walking through that door though. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6871.799999999999s)]
*  And if they had had, if they had one, even a bench guy who was a five, who [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6874.719999999999s)]
*  could stretch the floor a little bit. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6879.24s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6881.96s)]
*  Florida just escaped Yukon today. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6882.5599999999995s)]
*  Could have been my guy, Brady Dunlop. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6884.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6887.599999999999s)]
*  You got hurt. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6888.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6889.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're missing. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6889.88s)]
*  I'm sure he'll just recruit two shooters now. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6890.639999999999s)]
*  I think he should stay for a little while though, cause I think it became a real [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6892.96s)]
*  thing in New York and I think he's smart enough to realize that the point of his [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6896.24s)]
*  career that he's been in where he's basically done everything and he's made a [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6900.32s)]
*  shitload of money, like why not try to be the king in New York for one more year? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6903.24s)]
*  Cause I think he's one of the most crazy competitive people ever. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6906.599999999999s)]
*  I think he, there's another level to him that's even beyond like the most [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6910.24s)]
*  competitive people that you know. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6914.44s)]
*  I mean, nobody's ever resigned from as much money as he had at stake with the [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6916.28s)]
*  Celtics where he's just like, I resigned. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6920.28s)]
*  You can have the money back. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6922.28s)]
*  That never happens ever. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6924.2s)]
*  It's like, let's negotiate a buyout for three weeks. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6926.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm out. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6928.4s)]
*  Here's my facts. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6929.2s)]
*  But I don't know, man. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6931.08s)]
*  I've just seen it too many times. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6932.759999999999s)]
*  I've seen it too many times with him where he's just like, okay, what's the [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6933.96s)]
*  next challenge? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6936.16s)]
*  And I think that's just kind of the way he's wired. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6937.799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't even matter how old he is because the guy is, you know, arguably [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6940.679999999999s)]
*  the greatest college basketball coach of his era. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6944.08s)]
*  You know, I know there can be arguments made for other people, but I mean, this [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6947.4s)]
*  guy went to Greece after Louisville and you were like, okay, we're never going to [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6949.96s)]
*  hear from this guy again. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6952.719999999999s)]
*  And then he shows up cause I own is like, we'll do it. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6953.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6955.96s)]
*  And then he went to the cross in two years. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6956.16s)]
*  He has St. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6959.72s)]
*  John's as a two seat and winning the big East. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6960.320000000001s)]
*  So look, man, I would think there'd be a lot of people that would want to go [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6962.320000000001s)]
*  there. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6966.96s)]
*  The New York thing for St. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6967.08s)]
*  John's has always been a little difficult because you'd always think this is [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6968.12s)]
*  automatic, but then for the longest time, the New York kids actually didn't want [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6970.84s)]
*  to go there. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6974.320000000001s)]
*  They wanted to go somewhere else. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6975.0s)]
*  The setup wasn't necessarily that great. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6976.320000000001s)]
*  The NIL part of it, you know, you can get into the USC thing. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6977.92s)]
*  Like why wouldn't, why wouldn't, must be able to just get whoever he wanted to in [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6980.88s)]
*  LA and the marketability of LA and SC and all that stuff. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6985.92s)]
*  And it's like, man, I actually think it's a little more complicated. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6989.36s)]
*  I'd also argue the SC campus situation is, is better than maybe St. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6991.44s)]
*  John's over the years, but I don't care. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6995.16s)]
*  Like I'm not, I was bummed out. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6998.04s)]
*  They lost, but I was so happy about this year that I'm going to let that part of [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=6999.96s)]
*  it. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7004.08s)]
*  I think there could be some kind of memo to spike Lee though. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7004.2s)]
*  Like we're good. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7006.679999999999s)]
*  We don't need you decked out in St. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7009.04s)]
*  John's gear. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7011.2s)]
*  Spike, can we talk? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7013.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7015.5199999999995s)]
*  Lay back. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7016.08s)]
*  You don't get, you don't get enough. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7016.5599999999995s)]
*  Attention. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7018.679999999999s)]
*  You know, the next thing has been great for spike. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7020.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7024.2s)]
*  That could for him. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7024.88s)]
*  You need another team. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7025.799999999999s)]
*  He didn't need to add a second one. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7026.679999999999s)]
*  You, there's no way he was rooting for St. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7029.16s)]
*  John's or playing Georgetown is my guess. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7030.839999999999s)]
*  Very possible. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7034.759999999999s)]
*  Uh, Rossello back on your pod on Tuesday. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7037.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7041.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7042.48s)]
*  We're doing, uh, I don't know what we're doing. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7042.719999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7045.92s)]
*  Well, I'll see you, uh, in Boston, Massachusetts this week because we're [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7046.2s)]
*  doing a live rewatchable show. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7053.24s)]
*  Which one am I doing? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7057.12s)]
*  What time? [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7058.16s)]
*  We're doing good will hunting Thursday. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7058.5199999999995s)]
*  Thursday. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7060.92s)]
*  What time is the theater open? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7061.32s)]
*  Thursday at, uh, at night it's sold out. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7062.72s)]
*  It's at, uh, it's at house of blues. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7065.639999999999s)]
*  And we're doing that. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7068.5599999999995s)]
*  And then I'm making you come to at least a couple of Coolidge corner theater. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7069.4s)]
*  Um, you gotta come to, you gotta come see like heat or good fellows or one [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7073.240000000001s)]

*  I got so nervous when somebody sent me the itinerary and they're like, they [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7083.68s)]
*  want me to do the town again. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7086.320000000001s)]
*  I go, I'm not doing that. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7087.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7088.280000000001s)]
*  I'm never doing it. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7088.68s)]
*  We're just doing good hunting on Thursday. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7089.280000000001s)]
*  I was on the rewatchables this week. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7091.64s)]
*  So we got that coming up in the sky. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7093.84s)]
*  We had a category in the rewatchables called blind call to Rossello. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7096.72s)]
*  And every time we called, you didn't answer because you never answer your phone. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7100.96s)]
*  And then this time I did the call and van goes, call back, call second time. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7104.6s)]
*  Or Craig said that maybe hit his second time, maybe to go through called you [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7109.12s)]
*  answered and you did, uh, you did about a minute on blue chips. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7113.16s)]
*  It was great. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7117.24s)]
*  I was in the car too. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7119.52s)]
*  All right. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7120.72s)]
*  I'll see you in Boston. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7120.96s)]
*  See you. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5KgzTneJCM&t=7122.28s)]
