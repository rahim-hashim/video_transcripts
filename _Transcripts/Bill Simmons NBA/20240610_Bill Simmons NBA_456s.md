# Conspiracy Bill on the Lakers Coaching Job | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw)
*  Who do you think the next Laker coach is going to be? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=0.0s)]
*  This Hurley story is so weird. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  I feel like there's something wrong here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=8.06s)]
*  Cause I don't, I understand why he would want to do it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=11.74s)]
*  Living in LA is actually awesome when you find a place that you would like to live. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=16.12s)]
*  So that's not it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=19.62s)]
*  It's the Lakers. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=20.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=22.02s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=22.46s)]
*  If you're a lifer in basketball and the Lakers want you to be their head coach, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=23.82s)]
*  but are they going to pay him all that money when it's a family that isn't on the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=27.28s)]
*  richer side of the NBA ownership deal? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=31.8s)]
*  Were they really going to pay him that much money? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=34.42s)]
*  Like 120 million for seven years. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=36.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=39.8s)]
*  So if it's the money, okay. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=40.0s)]
*  If it's the Lakers, all right, lifestyle. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=43.2s)]
*  No problem. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=43.46s)]
*  All of those things, but it just, it felt weird to me the way it went along. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=44.36s)]
*  That all of a sudden it was like, wait this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=52.36s)]
*  Can we bring in conspiracy bill? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=54.4s)]
*  Please do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=56.82s)]
*  Woj once upon a time wrote a book about the Hurley family. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  I think has pretty good ties there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=63.7s)]
*  Um, we know JJ was talking to the Lakers for a while and probably wanted real money. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=66.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=71.86s)]
*  JJ is making money as a podcaster. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  He's making money as an ESPN announcer and for him to give up a life that he seems [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=74.14s)]
*  pretty happy with to take on this crazy Lakers job, he's going to want to get a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=79.9s)]
*  Lakers job, he's going to want to get paid. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=83.34s)]
*  So it felt like two weeks ago, JJ had the job, but then I'm not sure what happened. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=85.64s)]
*  Maybe he wanted too much money. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=91.64s)]
*  Maybe the Lakers wanted to put a little pressure on him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=94.48s)]
*  Maybe curly who I think just signed an extension. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=98.4s)]
*  Maybe he is looking at all these crazy NBA numbers where all these coaches now are [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=101.76s)]
*  making 10 million or more a year and he's thinking, shit, I'm actually still underpaid. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=106.26s)]
*  Maybe I have to float something out that I'm interested in the Laker job. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=111.48s)]
*  And then if you're the Lakers, you're like, this is great. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=114.68s)]
*  We get to steal headlines from the finals. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=116.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=120.04s)]
*  People are talking about the Lakers again, Hurley. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=120.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=122.72s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=123.44s)]
*  We'll do the meeting and then we ultimately end up with JJ and Hurley gets an extension. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=124.76s)]
*  And that's how this plays out. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=129.08s)]
*  That's conspiracy bills take. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=132.08s)]
*  I don't think it's a crazy conspiracy at all. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't, because if you know, I don't know what JJ makes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=138.76s)]
*  I could probably guess. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  And I could also guess that he's doing it in a way where if he were to do this a long [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=145.72s)]
*  time, you know, much like you, Bill, I mean, there's real money out there to be. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=150.24s)]
*  If you can start your own company and then somebody wants to acquire you later on, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  those numbers can be more than what NBA coaches make. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=159.24s)]
*  So as much as I would think if you're a JJ or a Hurley or whatever, like, oh [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=162.16s)]
*  my God, I could be the head coach of the Lakers. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=167.64s)]
*  I would imagine in LA. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  But if you're already making a ton of money, you're not going to go to the Lakers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=172.76s)]
*  and be like, well, I'll go, especially JJ who's so young. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  Like if he wants to, if he wants to coach at some point, he can coach, he could [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  probably build this company for five more years, sell it, continue to get better [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=183.6s)]
*  with the NBA stuff that he's doing at ESPN. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=188.64s)]
*  I mean, clearly he, the guy's got some goals and an execution plan here and he [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=191.32s)]
*  would have to delay all that and he could still do all of those things and then [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=195.0s)]
*  become a coach a little bit later on, unless the Lakers is like the absolute [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=198.6s)]
*  thing and you never know like the timing of things, like you can't just assume [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=201.6s)]
*  you're going to be off to the Lakers gig five, seven years ago or six, five or [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=204.36s)]
*  seven years from now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=208.16s)]
*  But I think you're the money part of it was right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=209.2s)]
*  Cause I was like for Hurley to do this, this is probably like a hundred million [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=211.44s)]
*  dollar contract with the new salaries that are going on for NBA coaches. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=213.96s)]
*  Like it, it went on a massive. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=216.96s)]
*  He did that extension. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=219.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=220.32s)]
*  Cause there's a couple of big deals that happen and same thing for JJ. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=221.0s)]
*  He's looking at that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=224.4s)]
*  Um, I do think there was a money piece. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=226.36s)]
*  There's a competitive needs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=229.52s)]
*  I agree with everything you said about JJ. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=230.72s)]
*  Just play this out, try to build value. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=232.6s)]
*  It's the same reason doc took the bucks job. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=235.68s)]
*  You know, doc was super happy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=238.56s)]
*  He was already getting paid for a job. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=240.76s)]
*  He got fired from his live in LA. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=242.6s)]
*  He's playing golf, having a great time and didn't want to coach again. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=244.24s)]
*  And then Milwaukee calls and like, Hey, do you want to coach Janice? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  He's like, I do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=250.76s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=251.8s)]
*  Cause he's competitive. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=253.32s)]
*  These guys have been competing their whole lives. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=254.4s)]
*  And when you pull that away, I think you miss it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  So with JJ, it's like, I could become the Lakers Lakers coach and I could. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=259.96s)]
*  Coach LeBron and Davis and a team that's going to spend money and is always [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=264.8s)]
*  kind of relevant in some way. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=269.0s)]
*  And this is one of the best jobs in sports, much less basketball. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=270.4s)]
*  And you get competitive about it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=274.68s)]
*  We come first of all, we're totally on the same page on that one. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=276.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  So if that's the driving force, I mean, I understand that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=280.44s)]
*  But there's a number when you're making as much money as JJ might be making [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=284.76s)]
*  now and could be making down the road where you go, all right, if I'm, I'm [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=290.32s)]
*  not just here at ESPN chopping it up late night on one of the studio shows. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  And then doing a couple of games. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=301.44s)]
*  And then even if you want to say it's the NBA finals, like I probably [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  guess where he's at at ESPN for that number, but the number for him, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=306.56s)]
*  and this sort of feels weird, but it's just part of the story. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=311.4s)]
*  The number that he could potentially obtain by building his own media company [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=314.44s)]
*  and all the value that comes with all that kind of stuff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=317.96s)]
*  That's where I would think where he's like, yeah, I'm competitive. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=320.08s)]
*  I miss it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=322.12s)]
*  I want to come back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=322.64s)]
*  I want to prove I can do this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=323.36s)]
*  I've always wanted to coach as the fucking Lakers. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=324.32s)]
*  I get to move back to Manhattan beach. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=326.12s)]
*  This is going to be incredible. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=327.44s)]
*  I can't, Oh wait, you thought I wanted to do this like for some sort of passion [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=328.28s)]
*  discount, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=332.36s)]
*  So five million a year. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=333.6s)]
*  Well, cause the other thing is he went for the Charlotte job too, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=335.6s)]
*  And they took Charles Lee, but he also interviewed for that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  So that tells me he really wants to coach. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=340.56s)]
*  I think he really does, but he also, they maybe made the mistake of floating it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=342.44s)]
*  out there that he was getting the job. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=348.32s)]
*  Cause I know you heard the same stuff I heard and it seemed like it was locked [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=349.96s)]
*  down and then all of a sudden we have this Dan Hurley story. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=353.4s)]
*  So, and then there was the Woshe Shams thing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=358.16s)]
*  You can't, you can't sleep on the Woshe Shams thing either. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=361.4s)]
*  Shams reports that JJ is getting the job. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=363.72s)]
*  And then Woshe comes back with a, wait a second, which I think is a piece too. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=367.28s)]
*  Is he getting the job? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=372.92s)]
*  What about Hurley? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=374.08s)]
*  And then boom. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=375.32s)]
*  So now one of those two guys is going to be Ron. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=376.48s)]
*  It's a fun story. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=378.64s)]
*  It was certainly a big topic at the finals. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=379.92s)]
*  It was who's going to win the finals and then what's going on with the Lakers or [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyL9FWwFvMw&t=381.88s)]
