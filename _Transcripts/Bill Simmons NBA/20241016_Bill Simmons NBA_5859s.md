# NBA Over/Unders Part 1: The Thunder/Mavericks Divisions | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o)
*  We're starting with the Northwest because that is probably going to have the best regular season team in the league the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=0.0s)]
*  Oklahoma City Thunder their over under is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  57 and a half how's that I've been monitoring FanDuel and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Some of the over hunters have just been going up and down because they're getting like this action 10 9 days [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=13.6s)]
*  So okay. This was 56 and a half. It was 55 and a half and now it's 57 and a half [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=18.84s)]
*  They are minus 140 to win the division. They are plus 340 for best record. They are plus [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=24.32s)]
*  130 to be the one seed in the West which I think is my favorite bet of the three parts [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=29.48s)]
*  60 plus wins is around plus 180 last year there are 57 and 25 and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=34.96s)]
*  They added Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=40.24s)]
*  Rossello [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=44.0s)]
*  Why isn't this over under even higher than 57 and a half? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=45.08s)]
*  Probably just because of the West like there's some good teams in the West that are gonna be completely left out and then obviously just start [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=48.2s)]
*  with the uncertainty of whatever the injury storyline is but [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  I'm with you. There's there's no way they're gonna be worse [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=56.92s)]
*  So it's moose and maybe they're just afraid to set a number 61 because it's just such a massive number [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  We know I'm not gonna go through every team stats here [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=66.76s)]
*  But their stat profiles off the charts except for the rebounding rate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=69.22s)]
*  Which was comically low for a team that was this good and so they've addressed it and they'll also address kind of the weird [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  Giddy problem that they had where they played him in a playoff game [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=78.88s)]
*  Then people were gonna sag off of them and now Caruso adds a spacing and a better defender even if you still kind of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=82.32s)]
*  Like Giddy skill set which I think I do so well and then young guys who are now your older [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  We got a little taste last year house. This seems to me very similar profile of the Celtics last year [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Really good starting five. They have a bench young team. That's gonna be durable for six months, which I think is important [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=97.52s)]
*  And I think they hit this. Yeah, the only thing I think is holding the number back holding it down is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=104.0s)]
*  They're so young we they just made it, you know last year made their first [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Long-gated run into the playoffs elongated the long. Yeah elongated run. It was a long gated run [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=115.84s)]
*  I don't know if it was elongated. It was two rounds [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  They made it they made it into the playoffs and that's keeping the number. I'm not kind of that is your first malapropism [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=124.76s)]
*  They are long though, they're so good on defense they're so f-ing good on defense [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=132.8s)]
*  They're gonna be an incredible defensive team and they have redundancy at all the positions and they're young and there's injury luck that they had last year [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=137.44s)]
*  But even if that bites them in the butt this year, they're gonna be good. Yeah, so they win in 22 [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=145.32s)]
*  They won 24 games 23. They won 40 last year. They won 57 in this year [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=151.16s)]
*  I think they're somewhere in the first half of the 60s. I would say in the 62 range [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=156.8s)]
*  Seems fair to me, but Rossello crunch time. I [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=161.56s)]
*  Guess this is a playoffs question more than a regular season question [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=164.92s)]
*  But you have chat you've Jalen Williams you've dork you've Caruso you have SGA [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=168.76s)]
*  You also have heart and Steve now you've Wallace who I think is gonna definitely probably be better than it was last year [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=173.04s)]
*  I like them last year Wiggins Isaiah Joe and other Jalen Williams and I guess my question is who is there five? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=178.08s)]
*  Those six seven times a year in the playoffs [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=186.72s)]
*  When it's like, all right, who's our five and I think it would be heart and Stein and Chet [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=190.36s)]
*  With Jalen Williams Caruso and SGA, but now I don't have Dord out there and I don't have Isaiah Joe with the shooting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=197.28s)]
*  It's a good problem to have [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=202.94s)]
*  But I just don't know what they're gonna do. I guess the good thing is they go big they can [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=204.94s)]
*  They can have a shooting line up [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=209.12s)]
*  I think you're right house [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  At least they have the option now and that was the thing that drove you crazy about it [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=214.12s)]
*  We spent time talking about other trade deadline [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=217.32s)]
*  Yeah, would just be in whatever you think of Jalen Williams to space the floor a little bit [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=219.12s)]
*  We know he's gonna take a handful of annoying charges, but they didn't have it and as much as we all like chat [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=224.0s)]
*  There's a certain night sort of like this guy's getting his ass handed to him [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=232.16s)]
*  Well, remember the rebounds in the Dallas series? I think I bet him to have the most rebounds in Dallas series [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=235.12s)]
*  I think he had like 20 total like he just got his absolute ass kick by a live link Gafford [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=239.64s)]
*  If the other teams big they both play if the other teams wing heavy than Dora will be and they'll split it up [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=245.92s)]
*  Can I make a nerdy basketball point? Yeah [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=251.24s)]
*  One of the things I liked about heart and Stein [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=254.48s)]
*  Heading back to the Clippers was when they would put him like a top of the key and they would kind of run offense [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=257.64s)]
*  Through him and I was like, what's this? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=264.6s)]
*  This guy's like Bill Walton at the top of the key and they like why don't they use this more and then the Knicks? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=266.04s)]
*  Really used it and I wonder with okc what that's cuz they were so shea [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=271.04s)]
*  Dominant last year was either Shay or Jalen Williams [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=275.88s)]
*  I wonder like how much they're gonna run through him and what it's gonna look like [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  It's just an extra wrinkle that I think they needed his awareness is a big and it's passing is like way [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  I didn't really catch on because I was in a Clippers season ticket [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=286.72s)]
*  yeah, but some of the stuff that I saw with him with the Knicks where he'd be [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=290.68s)]
*  Attacking the rim and right big doesn't give it up there and then there'd be somebody else crashing which then encourages everybody else to go [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  Hey follow [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=302.6s)]
*  Heart and Stein like follow him come to the other side cut off of it and he was just finding guys like wide open like [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=303.6s)]
*  The fact that he could still allow that late pass right before it looked like he was gonna go up at the rim contested [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=309.06s)]
*  And that's what Preston wants to do man. He wants to load this team up [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=314.04s)]
*  There's so many teams the last one I'll make at least on this part of it [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  There's so many teams when I do the depth chart. I'm like Denver would kill for that guy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that guy. Oh my god, Denver would love him like and you know, would Ken Rich Williams be like Denver like yes race [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  He's we now have a seventh made shirts. Yeah [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  house [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Is this the team is there another move with them because I don't want to go through all the picks they have they have probably [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=334.64s)]
*  the best batch I [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=341.24s)]
*  Think of picks of all the teams that have a shitload of picks they have they could swap at the Clippers this year [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=343.44s)]
*  They have Clippers unprotected next year. They have a bunch of stuff down the road [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=348.92s)]
*  Dallas I'm top two protected a couple Denver picks like near where yokage might be like, you know [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=353.4s)]
*  Riding horses four years from now and I've been playing in the Nuggets [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=360.36s)]
*  Would you do anything or is it early in the run here? You don't need to I don't think you need to you just sit tight [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=364.24s)]
*  You hope that you don't have any injuries [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=370.86s)]
*  But if you do have injuries you have all the flexibility in the world at the trade deadline or even before that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=373.22s)]
*  To address it you just try and run this team out there and let them let these kids win 64 games and grab the number one [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=378.22s)]
*  Seed and get on the playoffs. I think I agree with house. I would be willing to do something here [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=385.22s)]
*  But it would have just don't know what it was. I went through the ringer top hundred and I'm like [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=390.62s)]
*  There was one guy who's the guy [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=395.86s)]
*  Yanis [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=400.18s)]
*  I [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=402.18s)]
*  Granted everyone would trade for Yanis [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=404.18s)]
*  but if it goes badly and we'll talk about this in part two it Milwaukee goes badly and Yanis is like I [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=405.66s)]
*  Kind of want to keep winning titles guys [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=413.86s)]
*  Can you just send me to a place where I can win titles and okay sees like? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=415.64s)]
*  We have a lot of picks and a lot of stuff if they sign thin asses [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=419.74s)]
*  There's one more I I would do something only because like the picks are gonna become so redundant [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=427.06s)]
*  Yeah, like we're all excited about their depth or excited about the youth and all of these things that you know [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=432.18s)]
*  It can't be somebody that's already blown out three franchises, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=436.94s)]
*  Like hardened all of a sudden said I think I want to go to the Thunder. I'd be like, I'm good [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=441.38s)]
*  He's like I'm ready to come home right full circle. Let's do this. Okay, he's like we're good [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=444.62s)]
*  There's certain guys I would still stay away from but I think I'd be more proactive even if [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  Like I think I'm picking the Thunder to win the whole thing. So why would you mean to disrupt that? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=454.06s)]
*  I already have it at plus 750 and now it's at plus 625 because everybody's getting used to the fact that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=458.54s)]
*  The NBA season is about to get here [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=464.06s)]
*  That's why this win total it was fifty five and a half, you know [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=465.88s)]
*  Six weeks ago was fifty six and a half three days ago [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=469.22s)]
*  And now it's fifty seven and a half and all their one seed conference stuff people are all seeing the same things [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=471.62s)]
*  I'm not ready to announce my pick yet. There's one other guy that I thought would be interesting for them is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=478.5s)]
*  Trey Murphy and New Orleans [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=484.34s)]
*  Because if New Orleans and we'll talk about them when we get to them in more detail [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=486.46s)]
*  But if New Orleans is at a point where there's no market for Ingram [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=490.5s)]
*  Murphy they didn't sign to an extension, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=495.11999999999995s)]
*  You have to he's a restricted free agent in a year and you have to do that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=497.82s)]
*  But also what do you do with Ingram and maybe the move is you can get more stuff for Trey Murphy and keep Ingram and Ingram's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=501.34s)]
*  Like from an asset standpoint, it makes more sense to trade him [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=507.65999999999997s)]
*  Then if you're okay see that's exactly what you need if you're gonna add some of this team [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=511.38s)]
*  It's somebody who's just dead-eye [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=515.24s)]
*  Three-point shooter resize who can just come in and make shots, you know, that would be unfair [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=517.28s)]
*  I mean that would be like, you know the 2017 2018 war right like it's so stupid that they're this good already and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=521.48s)]
*  They have all of these picks [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=529.2s)]
*  Like it's that's pressing. I don't know that we're ever gonna see a run of like roster creation [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=531.36s)]
*  Also, and then we can do whatever we want [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=537.52s)]
*  And I I think in the years that we've talked about this in the past like some people have described to me [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=540.32s)]
*  Certainly not Presti to me, but other people saying like he's just gonna keep [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=544.68s)]
*  drafting and drafting and drafting and like you're gonna know and maybe some people are lost in the shuffle and will feel like a waste [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  Of pick but like it just gives you that many more chances to hit on something really special and said it's not like I love [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  Well to do stuff like the Caruso thing where now we can just put Wallace [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=560.2399999999999s)]
*  Get in the giddy spot right also get Caruso and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  They can just keep doubling tripling down. They also have the ability to just [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=568.68s)]
*  They're like the it's like when you read those stories about Jeff Bezos [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=572.76s)]
*  Whatever that island in Florida that he buys houses on and he's like, yeah, I'm gonna get that house, too [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=575.88s)]
*  And the guys like it's not for sale and it's like it is now [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  How about 75 million and the guys like I guess it is for sale [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=582.92s)]
*  That's what okay see could do if they want one more shooter. It's like well, we're not trading Trey Murphy [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  What if we give you three firsts and we'll give you [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=591.84s)]
*  Wiggins and what a pick swap then and like I guess we're trading them [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=595.08s)]
*  They have the ability to do that so I think we all see the same stuff [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=598.96s)]
*  I don't see a scenario where they're not a 61 team unless [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=602.4s)]
*  Played 75 or more games last year Jaylen Williams of the eight top rotation guys played the least and it was still 71 games [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=608.96s)]
*  I will keep making this point as we go through the teams [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=616.24s)]
*  You saw it last year with the South's these younger teams with durable young stars are just better bets with overs [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=619.28s)]
*  Whereas we'll get to maybe there's a team where the best part in the team is announced [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm no longer playing back-to-backs for the rest of my career who would do that? That might be a team that I'd be less [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=630.44s)]
*  Excited to take. All right, so we're all in over for okc. I'm just gonna say now this is a lock for me [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=635.88s)]
*  Coming out of the gate with a locker Rooney. You guys don't have to decide now, but that's gonna be a lot. Okay [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=642.2800000000001s)]
*  It's on the lock list. Yeah, it just makes it easier this week. So [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=647.6s)]
*  The next one all sudden it's gonna get harder here because Minnesota is our next one [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=651.64s)]
*  They're over under has bumped up to 51 and a half. It was down this morning to 50 and a half [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  Then it went back up to 51 and a half [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=659.88s)]
*  Minnesota action all over the place division plus 270 conference five to one title ten to one [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=662.4s)]
*  One seed thirteen to one if you think they can win sixty plus five sixty [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=667.84s)]
*  Now this team they lost Carl Anthony Townsend Kyle Anderson [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=673.0s)]
*  They added Julius Rano Dante de finchenzo and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=676.6800000000001s)]
*  Rob [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  Dillingham [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  Rossello, what does the team built to beat Denver? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  Do after they actually beat Denver? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=687.6s)]
*  Well, I don't know [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=692.32s)]
*  You know, I don't know what the cat market would be because [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=695.96s)]
*  Talking to teams it was like oh cat got traded and then it was like were you upset that the front office didn't shopping more [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=699.72s)]
*  It wasn't like a why didn't we get a call? This wasn't pal to the Lakers [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=705.86s)]
*  This wasn't the guy in your fantasy lake who made a trade and didn't tell anyone else everyone's bad at him [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=709.66s)]
*  Yeah, cuz there would be things like yeah, we don't really know they wanted cat anyway [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=713.94s)]
*  But I guess you just wanted to be asked if you wanted him [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=717.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they apparently really wanted even chenzo who by the way is turned into Larry Bird the last two weeks. I love it [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=719.86s)]
*  chirping everybody this I [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=725.78s)]
*  Like D. Vincenzo a lot me too. Is this a runaway train of like because it's kind of a cat D. Vincenzo trade [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=727.98s)]
*  Wow [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=734.9s)]
*  Julius is upset about that. Well, Julius isn't expiring and it's kind of like show us if you're gonna stick around or are you really gonna play? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=737.78s)]
*  Randall go bear and Nas read to close a playoff game. You're not you're probably gonna play around with Nas read [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=744.8199999999999s)]
*  Depends on who they're playing [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=752.6999999999999s)]
*  so [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=754.74s)]
*  The fact that they got D. Vincenzo the more I stare at this [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=756.18s)]
*  it just seems like the Knicks called them for towns for [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=760.26s)]
*  Two straight months there you can put Dante in there. Nope. Okay. All right [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=764.14s)]
*  Hanging up then like two days later. Hey, what about town? So you ready yet? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=769.5s)]
*  Put Dante in there. Nope, and then something snapped when I think they realized Robinson was just not coming back anytime soon [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=773.62s)]
*  And they got him. I think it really hurts the Knicks [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=780.38s)]
*  But this guy is kind of what they needed [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=784.66s)]
*  Right is he's a guy who doesn't need the ball that much who can handle the ball [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=787.66s)]
*  Who's unafraid in big moments who can save them on the nights that Edwards doesn't have it or Edwards is being shut down [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=792.18s)]
*  I was in foul trouble. I just [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=798.5799999999999s)]
*  It's weird to say this but I kind of like him on that team more than towns and I know towns is way better [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=802.02s)]
*  Yeah town for talent. It feels insane to go like I kind of get it right when the trade happened and you're looking at the pieces [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=808.5s)]
*  You're thinking okay. Well talent in even if you don't like towns. Yeah, I feel like New York wins the trade [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=815.02s)]
*  And [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=821.18s)]
*  Especially when you look at the need for the Mitchell Robinson timeline [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=823.0999999999999s)]
*  Hardenstein's gone. So you're like this is really nice because now you have this stretch five option who doesn't have to be the primary [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=826.54s)]
*  He's he's like it's a better team for him. No question. You're better team for town [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=832.78s)]
*  We'll see cuz I kind of can't stand for [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=837.18s)]
*  We've discussed it many times there's a record [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=841.8199999999999s)]
*  But I'm I'm with you. I thought there were times with the Timberwolves last year [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  Or was like, you know, Jane's not really an attacking on ball guy consistently enough [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=849.1s)]
*  I think it's why they you know, he died in the Dowsers [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=854.5s)]
*  Yeah, and Conley just isn't really a guy is gonna be breaking down a ton of dudes off the dribble anymore [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=857.1800000000001s)]
*  I think it's why they were like, hey, we don't have a ton of flexibility anymore [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=861.4200000000001s)]
*  So let's go after Dillingham [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=864.6600000000001s)]
*  So an on ball creator and not the defense is gonna be running everything but he can just do so many different things [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=866.22s)]
*  It's just more. Yeah, it's more uncertainty for the deep incredibly good fit [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=871.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, such a good fit and and in addition to all the basketball skill and everything what we've seen the last two weeks that swagger [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=875.54s)]
*  Works it's gonna work with this team. It's gonna help Anthony Edwards [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=883.94s)]
*  It's gonna help you know, cuz Anthony Edwards is ready to put his imprint on the league [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=887.26s)]
*  You want to see that clip? I mean, I'm tell me about the clip. There was which clip random preseason game [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=891.94s)]
*  What was it Sunday? Yes, one of the great days in New York sports history and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=897.72s)]
*  And he just he gets caught with Brunson on the side [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=901.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah that one you saw that one and he's just like I'm shutting this guy down and Brunson's doing his Brunson [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=904.9399999999999s)]
*  they clear out for him and he's doing all these different things and [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=910.8199999999999s)]
*  Ants just with him the whole way and he's talking shit to him and then forces a terrible shot [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=913.98s)]
*  Which the Knicks actually get the rebound but after he did it [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=918.9s)]
*  Ant did like the I just hit a walk-off home run in baseball kind of double fist pump scream [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=921.1s)]
*  Like it's like fucking like that guy down [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=926.74s)]
*  I mean if you're looking for like different types of lineups for a series where it's starting to go sideways because go bear is getting [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=928.46s)]
*  Exploited river. I like their flexibility more [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=935.46s)]
*  I it also means more Nas read like if you look at that, that's the thing [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=938.24s)]
*  he Nas good played 81 games and still played less total minutes than cat because [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=941.7s)]
*  Number one pick faced the franchise there a little while turns the keys over to ant because he had to because ant was the better player [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=946.98s)]
*  So I think ant did a really good job of massaging all that stuff [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=953.3199999999999s)]
*  But then it's like I was okay giving the keys that ant but now I'm giving him a fucking Nas read [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=956.28s)]
*  You know, so like what's going on here? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=960.36s)]
*  And you know cat they were 10 games over 500 without him, right? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=963.0s)]
*  And also he got hurt every year for 15 to 30 games or whatever. I am an over for this house and [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  I battled on it [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=975.56s)]
*  but they were 56 and 26 last year and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=978.36s)]
*  We didn't talk about Randall yet and Randall is such a divisive guy with the Knicks fans [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=982.2s)]
*  and I have Knicks fans in my life who are [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  Hardcore you guys don't understand Randall's really good [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=990.08s)]
*  he did all this stuff and then I have other fans in my life who like get that guy out of here, but [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=992.84s)]
*  It's it's playing is in a contract year. He brings something different to them and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=998.08s)]
*  You know, I think it gives them a lot of go-bear insurance [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1004.32s)]
*  There's a you go Nas and Randall a crunch time you just don't have to worry about the go-bear piece [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1007.0s)]
*  yeah, I like that [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  Chris Finch and [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1013.7199999999999s)]
*  Randall are on the same page in terms of the incentives, right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1016.68s)]
*  They have the same incentive in terms of the outcome for the player and the team this season [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1020.28s)]
*  so it lines you're gonna get the very best version of Randall in my humble opinion because I [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1025.44s)]
*  have immense respect 90% chance of that 10% chance of [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1029.84s)]
*  People are like man Randall looks bummed why would he be bumped [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1033.68s)]
*  Not enough playing crunch time [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1038.68s)]
*  If it's a weird fit my immediate reaction was the ball stopper piece of this with Edwards and and we love Edwards [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1041.16s)]
*  I think as much as anyone but there's he gets a little ball stoppy from time to time and then Randall definitely does [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  And I thought it was the two of them together is weird [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1053.44s)]
*  Like not only the need and the positional fit and the stretch five that makes the Celtics have to defend a stretch five [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1055.5600000000002s)]
*  Like if that's how the playoffs play out like there's a bunch of reasons why I still like this for the Knicks even with my cat [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1061.52s)]
*  Doubt and I know we'll probably do more on this then so it's a bit redundant [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1066.84s)]
*  But Randall ball stopping was another thing that I loved for the Knicks here because it's a real thing [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1070.36s)]
*  He's incredibly talented like yes when you look at all those years. He's putting up 20-plus [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1076.0s)]
*  I think 26 in one season [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1080.24s)]
*  You're going man this guy's talented and he can really pass [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1082.24s)]
*  He's always been able to pass going back to college be like well how like but then there's a limitation on who you are as a team [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1084.6s)]
*  And even in the rare times the Knicks had Brunson og and Randall all together. It's like an incredible record [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1090.08s)]
*  It's an awesome net rating. I think if they'd have played out more and more and you'd had playoff moments [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1095.8s)]
*  I think they may have gotten in each other's way and now I think it's more defined. Yeah, I'm a Randall apologist [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1101.52s)]
*  I think that when we go back and look at those years of him with the ball stopping [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1106.6s)]
*  He was the only option right he knew it. That was it [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1110.36s)]
*  He was the only option right he knew it that was it [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1113.08s)]
*  That was something we said for you put up 24 10 and 5 for a couple years in a row [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1115.62s)]
*  He was all in BA a couple times like he's you know and he might turn out to be the underrated guy in the trade [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1120.54s)]
*  Which is weird because he's good [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1125.48s)]
*  But but we could be in December and people going wow Randall's really good didn't think he'd be good at this good on the Timberlops [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1126.8s)]
*  It's like yeah, he's good, but I could also see another version where it's like wow [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1132.4399999999998s)]
*  This is still clumsy, and it's mid-december, and they haven't really figured out how to integrate all these guys [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1136.34s)]
*  Quick question is towns [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1140.6799999999998s)]
*  Ewing theory eligible for either of you guys [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1143.08s)]
*  No [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1146.32s)]
*  Okay, I think they were the number on pick [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1147.8799999999999s)]
*  He's probably headed to the Hall of Fame with the stats because everyone makes the hall fan [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1150.84s)]
*  Just pull up his number just made it pull up his numbers real quick in the playoffs against house. Are you with me on? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1154.36s)]
*  on [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1160.6s)]
*  Pushing back on his self-proclaimed best shooting big of all time [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1161.8s)]
*  You know I've been trying to need a little more time to think about it [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1167.4399999999998s)]
*  Connect can I have one more day to mull it over release catching threes are a little different than off the dribble pull-ups from Durant [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1171.42s)]
*  I think there's a slightly different like how why did that become like well? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1179.1s)]
*  He's pretty tall and he shoots it from three pretty good [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1185.08s)]
*  Well, I mean yeah, he's right one of the biggest reasons [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1187.8999999999999s)]
*  I wrote my book was because I didn't want people in the year 2050 to think Karl Malone was the best 12 players of all time [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1190.5s)]
*  Good job. I just I had to do it good job. It was really drove me to 700 pages the next generation of me [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1196.3s)]
*  I would hope I would hope proving that Karl Anthony Towns and Dwight Howard weren't as actually impactful as the numbers and the OMB a's made [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1203.0s)]
*  It seem right would be a catalyst for them [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1210.24s)]
*  Because there's gonna he is definitely gonna be 25 years from like wow look at those Towns numbers [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1213.34s)]
*  He must be amazing. He is the epitome of this like whenever hit me when I I did this when Derek Rose retired [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1218.3799999999999s)]
*  He wins the MVP that year and you understood why he won it and he won it like in an overwhelming first place [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1225.14s)]
*  Oh, okay, it was like 78 to 5 or it was even it was even bigger than that [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1232.22s)]
*  It was a massive spread [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1236.22s)]
*  I was like single digits for yeah Ron and then I think a hundred boats or something for Derek Rose and in the moment [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1237.46s)]
*  You're like hey, you know what it makes kind of sense the one seed young guy [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1243.02s)]
*  It wasn't 60 games LeBron is you know being held to a LeBron standard from the previous two years when he won the MVP [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1246.78s)]
*  You go back and look at that on basketball reference right now [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1253.26s)]
*  You're like what the fuck was wrong with you guys how I know and I wrote a column picking Rose [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1256.14s)]
*  Passionately, so I like to believe that in the moment [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1261.94s)]
*  You can you could still be right even if the data years later goes that doesn't make any sense [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1266.18s)]
*  And I think towns is like the the opposite of that where people are gonna go look at these [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1270.8600000000001s)]
*  This guy was nasty [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1276.98s)]
*  You know with that said perfect team firm right now if it's in there if [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1279.06s)]
*  If he can be an actual impactful guy who can play for straight playoff is Bridges gonna take four shots again [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1284.66s)]
*  We're gonna save this for the next yeah, let's say for next last question forget the overs [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1290.46s)]
*  So Edwards 12 plus playoff games 27 plus points per game [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1295.38s)]
*  44% field goal 22 and under just the guys of all time who did this [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1300.94s)]
*  Amari Anthony Edwards LeBron James Kobe Luca and Kevin Durant [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1306.1s)]
*  So we went from like we were going nuts about Anthony Edwards and was like slow down stop with the MJ stuff slow down [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1311.34s)]
*  and I was like well fucking a he's like killing everybody like [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1317.34s)]
*  Can we at least talk about how it's like it feels a little MJS without without offending MJ [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1320.98s)]
*  It would cool and then round three it went backwards and then in the Olympics [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1325.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, he's basically a heat check guy in the Olympic team [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1330.8999999999999s)]
*  But now I think it's kind of been forgotten how awesome he was and I wonder does it go up a level [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1333.86s)]
*  Does it actually as good as last year was was the playoffs to start of something else and that's [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1338.8999999999999s)]
*  The number one reason I'm going over 51 and a half because I think he really will give a shit week after week during [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1343.58s)]
*  The NBA season which is what you need for overrunners. Yeah, I wondered with the Dallas series [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1349.5s)]
*  You know in the mistakes there's some big mistake possessions there with him [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1354.78s)]
*  Yeah, but as you pointed out house, I mean cat was 38 and 24 splits against Dallas if cat is just [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1358.66s)]
*  Hitting a few more of these open shots. They might be playing for an NBA championship [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1365.42s)]
*  No, it doesn't feel that way with the way Luca Dallas all kind of gelled together until they ran into Boston [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1369.5400000000002s)]
*  But I'm with you. I'm going over even though it's like you're sitting here at the West going man [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1374.98s)]
*  The reason Vegas is putting these projections lower than you would think at the top is that you have to find [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1380.26s)]
*  Mmm, like where are you finding all of these wins with how good like 1 through 13 is [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1384.8600000000001s)]
*  But I don't want to go under 51 and a half for the end point that you just made [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1390.5s)]
*  That's so good. It's an easy over for me. Okay, I don't think the West is 1 through 13 good, but yeah fun [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1395.8600000000001s)]
*  I just quick Rob Dillingham thing off of Minnesota. Yes [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1401.46s)]
*  Fascinating preseason stuff from him and I don't know [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1406.18s)]
*  What we're gonna get from him during the season, but I'm excited for it [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1409.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a couple moments where you [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  It's like whoa this they could actually use this this is unpredictable [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1415.3s)]
*  Guy who can who can just go by people and do things. They're a good front office [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1420.3s)]
*  So the fact yeah that proactive and then knowing with all the pick tax still do on the go bear deal [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1425.3s)]
*  That when they did that it was like, you know what they saw it makes you feel good when you're watching me [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1431.02s)]
*  Like they need somebody else who can attack from the other side with it [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1436.58s)]
*  What's Connelly gonna look like eight months exactly exactly he was he was running on fumes right round three if [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1438.94s)]
*  Dillingham doesn't go to Kentucky is Reed Shepard the number one pick [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1445.66s)]
*  Well, I think now that we know what we know. Well house and I we're gonna talk about Risha Shay Island later [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1449.74s)]
*  If you've been on Redfin no, this is unbelievable. Yeah, I mean you want to talk about an all-time pivot in two and a half months [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1457.14s)]
*  With really a pivot with my opinion I'm out on trying to predict foreign guys [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1465.38s)]
*  The only thing I knew for sure is that the wizard shouldn't take Alex. Sorry scoop from you didn't like the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1470.54s)]
*  Croatian it turns out scoots from Bulgaria. Yeah [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1475.78s)]
*  That makes sense. All right, the Denver Nuggets. They're over under his 50 and a half [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1479.3s)]
*  Which seems offensive because Nicole the Oakage is in the prime of his career [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1483.34s)]
*  and he's one of the best 15 players of all time and they still have Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter jr. And [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1487.02s)]
*  Christian Brown and Jamal Murray now they have Russell Westbrook, which I can't wait to talk about [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1492.8200000000002s)]
*  Yoga just never played with an NBA player [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1500.22s)]
*  And I'm starting to wonder if he ever will [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1503.26s)]
*  Because we thought Murray was gonna take a step up and it went backwards in the playoffs and then the Olympics [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1506.9s)]
*  I don't know what happened was he out of shape was he hurt? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1512.3400000000001s)]
*  But it was awful. It was so awful [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1514.74s)]
*  And now they're kind of stuck with their contracts unless they can figure out a porter trade because he makes a lot [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1517.58s)]
*  Gordon's got an extension coming up. They just paid Murray [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1523.62s)]
*  This is kind of the team and Yoko might go through his entire career without ever played with an NBA guy [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1526.3799999999999s)]
*  Which if you look at the 15 16 best guys ever all of them have played with awesome guys [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1531.74s)]
*  and not him [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1537.6599999999999s)]
*  It's a bummer. I mean they [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1539.82s)]
*  the I [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1542.5s)]
*  Understand the thought process that led the Nuggets to [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1543.98s)]
*  Signing Michael Porter jr. To the contract that they signed it to but to me that's like the fulcrum contract [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1547.9s)]
*  That's the thing they invested so much in that guy that it prevented them [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1552.5s)]
*  They lost, you know in consecutive years guys that helped them win a ring right and what they have coming up [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1556.84s)]
*  Talent wise is just not there [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1564.26s)]
*  So well, they're missing picks too because they have some picks going out the window later in the decade [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1566.06s)]
*  so it's gonna be really hard for this time team to get better, which is [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1570.54s)]
*  How we get to our guy Russ he's back see him set a screen the other night. I was fucking awesome [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1574.7s)]
*  He's like, what are these six teams in seven years off ball screens you can do these [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1581.66s)]
*  Six teams in seven years the 2017 MVP [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1591.82s)]
*  I think there should be a whole like even though he's an MVP and he's gonna go into the Hall of Fame [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1595.18s)]
*  I think if you're on that many teams in that shorter time, you should have to wait a year [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1598.9s)]
*  To not be in the hall. Yeah, like hey, you're eligible this year [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1602.82s)]
*  But you were people were talking about you being one of the best players in the league and you ended up in that many different [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1605.62s)]
*  cities in that short amount of time but all for the same reasons teams that teams that [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1611.1799999999998s)]
*  Talked themselves into what he does. I thought he was actually really good in the Cooper's regular season. Which team did he make worse? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1617.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna try and do a little well houses your pro wet. He made the Wizards good [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1623.9399999999998s)]
*  He taught Denny Avdya how to be a professional early in his career [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1629.02s)]
*  The guy wasn't gonna learn it from the organization call fame black. Well, but look [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1632.34s)]
*  He you know, what kind of like we're doing math if Russ isn't there [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1635.74s)]
*  It's impossible to say in Washington method isn't big in Washington. If only he had been there for Jordan pool in time [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1639.36s)]
*  Oh god. Oh my god, who knows Russ's [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1645.54s)]
*  Playoff team since [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1649.9s)]
*  2017 when he won the MVP starting that playoff year. What do you think their record is in the playoffs? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1651.66s)]
*  Russell Westbrook's playoff teams. It's got to be a handful of games below 500 maybe 10 games below 500 [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1657.3s)]
*  I think well, I'll give you this 44 games total. What's the record? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1662.26s)]
*  Well, if it's 44 it's like I don't know [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1667.74s)]
*  27 and 17 I was gonna say 17 and 27 15 and 29. It's 13 and 31. Oh my god. It's even worse. Yeah, it's not good [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1672.82s)]
*  But it's the whole point so like yeah, I get what LA did because they had health concerns and it was like [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1681.4599999999998s)]
*  Hey his energy alone, but they did it because of the resume and the profile and because active players are so enamored with Westbrook [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1689.1s)]
*  They're not watching him critically. They're not watching how we fit in if he has the ball every single time down [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1696.6999999999998s)]
*  He is so overwhelming athletically and physically and his attitude. He will get you production as you saw in Washington [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1702.62s)]
*  Okay, that's what we wanted from scoot, right? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1708.8s)]
*  But once he is off the ball, it is the it's a waste of everybody's time and Denver is so thin in the bench [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1711.26s)]
*  I think they were one sort of desperate to think they were adding somebody apparently Yocic wanted him there [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1718.1399999999999s)]
*  They even gave him like the second-year option on it when it was it was kind of an odd deal [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1723.26s)]
*  They're so thin that I understand why Denver's doing it, but I would just simply ask this [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1727.58s)]
*  closing big-time games [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1733.1799999999998s)]
*  You're not taking the ball out of the best player in the league's hands. So what is Westbrook doing to your spacing? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1735.26s)]
*  We've already seen that not work at all of these other stops once he had to be off the ball [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1740.2s)]
*  He's not a useful player. Can I give you the zag? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1744.44s)]
*  sure [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1747.88s)]
*  Can you imagine how amazing would be if Russell Westbrook at this point of his career? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1749.24s)]
*  He was in the 2008 draft just turned into this amazing Yocage teammate. We were like, whoa, I [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1753.64s)]
*  Didn't realize he could do all this. This is like Bill Walton on the 86 Celtics second look at these back cuts [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1761.44s)]
*  No [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1767.68s)]
*  Why was he hiding it? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1769.04s)]
*  That's what I mean. I also look the Dallas series [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1771.56s)]
*  It was in here all along he couldn't get anything done in the Dallas series when they needed him desperately and yeah became [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1774.92s)]
*  Unhinged they couldn't play him. So like that's my last [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1780.2s)]
*  I feel about him as a basketball player like that last stretch against Dallas. So if I gave you house I gave you [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1784.92s)]
*  Westbrook is a playoff asset [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1791.32s)]
*  Westbrook is waived in January so he can catch on with another team. You could only pick one of those two options [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1794.32s)]
*  What would you pick playoff asset because I think this is going to be the greatest feat of Joker's career [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1799.76s)]
*  Who has Russell Westbrook had played with with at this state, you know along you got to play with LeBron. That's pretty good [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1805.76s)]
*  He got to play with KD. That's pretty good [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1813.0s)]
*  But the Joker's an entirely different animal all we've seen the thing that all that's pretty most about it [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1814.84s)]
*  George Durant hardened they're good. Why like they're good, but everybody's enamored with him [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1820.84s)]
*  They're good. Yeah, Bradley Beale. The Joker's different. The Joker sets his guys up. The Joker is [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1827.56s)]
*  15 minutes a game where it's just like when Joker's not in the game. Can you just that's fine [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1834.2s)]
*  Yeah, that might be what it is how screwed they are with the roster and money and the cost like they couldn't match the Bruce Brown thing [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1838.7s)]
*  Different the KCP price is kind of scary for a guy that even in a playoff game. You're like, did he play last night? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1846.1999999999998s)]
*  I thought that number was too high [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1852.2399999999998s)]
*  He was what was he seven point eight points a game in the playoffs if he had zero points in a playoff game [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1854.36s)]
*  Would you be shot? Is she in did he play last night all stars for you? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  and yet [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  You know you look at what's happened here and Calvin Booth has been drafting guys [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1866.6799999999998s)]
*  You're like, okay [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1870.54s)]
*  That's guys played a little bit more and then you have just that age-old [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1871.28s)]
*  Conflict between front office and coach like yours [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1874.52s)]
*  There was a couple years ago where they were so banged up [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1877.24s)]
*  They didn't have really any offense to close games and Malone still wouldn't play Michael Porter jr [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1880.4s)]
*  Because he was so mad about his defensive lapses [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1884.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1886.4s)]
*  And Porter jr was atrocious defensively terrible instincts always made like the wrong read would jump in its lane that he wasn't supposed to [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1886.68s)]
*  So Malone hardcore old-school og type of coach like I can't have those kind of defensive mistakes reward you with minutes [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1893.6000000000001s)]
*  Like dude, you don't have anybody else you can get a bucket [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1900.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1902.84s)]
*  And so I think the disconnect from what I can tell is that booth is keep he keeps drafting all these guys like straw [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1903.34s)]
*  There maybe has a chance Peyton Watson's like fun and athletic but none of these guys are shooters [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1910.08s)]
*  Christian Brown's gonna go up from I don't know. Is he gonna play 35 minutes a game? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1915.16s)]
*  You need him to be the 35 minute game starter bad [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1920.24s)]
*  They also talked themselves into Sarich, which is kind of like he's like discount Westbrook for teams talking themselves into him [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1923.3999999999999s)]
*  Remember the Warriors last year like Sarich like in November good passers [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1929.72s)]
*  Oh, sorry also second rookie of the year voting. Yeah [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1933.22s)]
*  Sharj for you remember that no, so keep it moving over under 50 and a half and [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1937.92s)]
*  this comes down to if Murray sucks or [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1945.24s)]
*  Is just can't get it going this year's late bloomer. It's gonna be really tough to hit this but they were 57 and 25 last year. I [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1949.1200000000001s)]
*  Just can't go against yokage [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1957.44s)]
*  And I don't I also kind of deep down don't want to but 51 and 31 [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1959.76s)]
*  I mean he's the best part of his generation at this point. I just can't I [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1963.04s)]
*  I feel the same way I did this last year with Luca and we argued about it and you were like that number's too low [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  I just can't believe Luca's not gonna win that many games and I look at yokage [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1973.48s)]
*  I'm like it's gonna have so we'd have to have 32 losses to lose this [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1977.4s)]
*  It's gonna lose 32 times guy plays every game. So I'm going slight over. I don't feel great about it [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1981.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going under [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1987.08s)]
*  I think the ceiling the regular season ceiling for this team is 50 [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1989.08s)]
*  I don't think that there's a move out there because of the contract constraints, but they need talent [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1993.3799999999999s)]
*  They're just not good enough. You can't play Christian Brown with however many minutes are gonna play it. They don't have they're going to yeah [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  Murray's not good. He can't be healthy and he's not good. So I wish them. We're the very is good [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2006.32s)]
*  He just hasn't been when is he good? When's he gonna be good? It's been how many? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2012.56s)]
*  Six seven months how many games? I'm not giving up. He was he was so good two years ago. Yeah [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2016.32s)]
*  Yeah, he was so we're betting on this year. Yeah [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2022.4399999999998s)]
*  I thought there was a good throw in there. Yeah [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2027.24s)]
*  No, I think it is is where we're using present tense sure. All right present tense. We can and it was tough [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2030.52s)]
*  How's this show shook from? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2036.56s)]
*  No, I bet against him I won money betting against can't but just them him just not playing fourth quarters in the Olympics [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2038.1599999999999s)]
*  Nothing, although I guess Jason Tate neither. What do you ever solo over under? I hate going under your kitchen [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2043.94s)]
*  I hate yeah, and if you look at the last four years 57 wins 53 wins [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2049.54s)]
*  48 47 so I mean that's a little irrelevant [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2054.5s)]
*  There's a couple stats here that just kind of shock you when you do their resume they were [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2057.06s)]
*  They were last in three point attempts per game and then they were also 29 free throw attempts per game [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2062.06s)]
*  Sure, like where like now it's another year with like whatever you think of KCP is we I think we're fair about it [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2068.1200000000003s)]
*  You have to guard them. There's still other nights there and when you look at the depth chart, you're like, alright back up Russ [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2076.32s)]
*  Strother hunter Tyson who I did love in the combine Peyton Watson charge or Zeke notch like [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2082.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna go I hate it. Well, I can't go over over over Minnesota Denver and OKC [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2089.04s)]
*  So I gotta pick one to be an under and it was a coin toss between Minnesota and Denver so I'll go under I [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2095.02s)]
*  Have some unders coming for the rest of the division. So I felt fine about it. I can't go under on yoga [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2100.66s)]
*  It's fine the prime of his career. I just can't I know [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2106.06s)]
*  That's why I don't feel good about it. Yeah, it's fine. It's one of my least favorite straight overs eight straight overs from alone [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2109.02s)]
*  So, you know, you're bucking the trend the under is popular. It's minus 132 [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2115.14s)]
*  So everybody's plowing into the under the public following into the under [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2119.46s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about like may not but if Murray [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2123.18s)]
*  I mean even with weird Murray seasons like remember the start of last year [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2128.1s)]
*  Yeah, and they still won 57 I know and they should have been the one see I guess the best thing for this is [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2132.72s)]
*  Yokich plays [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2137.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. Yeah, sure play. It's a good case. And by the way, this is not picking a bead when he lost MVP [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2139.5s)]
*  He took under 15 shots again, right? What it really is is Michael Porter, Jr. Making a leap that we're still kind of waiting [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2144.94s)]
*  We're being traded for Brandon Ingram. Yeah, I don't know every what does that I get from that guy. I'm like [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2151.78s)]
*  I'm just saying like how do you get to a mid-50 win team? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2158.26s)]
*  There could be like a draft of when you hear a quote from this person [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2162.46s)]
*  Do you that because hoops? I've been just anonymous quotes. There's usually like an injury. Oh, yeah, that sounds like Dwight [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2167.42s)]
*  Eric, we'll go [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2173.3s)]
*  This sounds like a podcast [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2176.42s)]
*  What do you guys have shows you touch as over under 27 and a half they were 31 and 51 last year [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2178.62s)]
*  They added Cody Williams who's had a couple good Twitter montage videos so far [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2186.02s)]
*  I [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2191.46s)]
*  Don't know what the fuck this team's plan is [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2193.14s)]
*  They just have a shitload of picks and a bunch of young guys. They did not want to trade Lori marketing. I [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2194.86s)]
*  don't I also don't think they want to be good and [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2200.78s)]
*  My assumption is they're gonna do what they did last year, which was they started out 26 and 26 [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2203.86s)]
*  They've done that the last two seasons, but then they traded guys who were helping them. Yeah, including your guy font neck. Yo [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2210.18s)]
*  Yeah, they finished five and 25 down the stretch. I feel like that's who we're getting this year [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2216.46s)]
*  Not the 26 and 26 teams. So [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2221.44s)]
*  This is gonna be an under for me fellas. Where do you stand Brazil? Do you know why they signed marketing? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2224.34s)]
*  Yeah, cuz he's really good and they also did in a way where he's ineligible to be traded now this year and it sounds [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2230.18s)]
*  It sounds like you do that because I think for whatever they were getting for him there to have a bunch of picks [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2235.7s)]
*  Nobody made an awesome offer. I think they can awesome offer. I don't think they wanted to trade him [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2241.46s)]
*  Why made an awesome offer Gold State? I [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2245.8199999999997s)]
*  Think they acted like they were gonna trade him and then we're like now or not [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2248.7799999999997s)]
*  Just to like I think age fucks with everybody [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2253.7s)]
*  Maybe to what end he did this in Boston to he'd be like we're rebuilding our trading for Isaiah Thomas [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2256.42s)]
*  He was just all over the place because Isaiah Thomas was free and he's an asset guy, right? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2261.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's like I think marketing is an asset if you're not gonna bowl me over I'm keeping them [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2265.9s)]
*  Yeah, but they're in a weird spot because they still owe the pick from a Derek favor salary dump [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2270.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah from 21 so they owe it to okay see so they're of course [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2275.22s)]
*  It's either it's one through ten protected this year one through a protected next [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2280.06s)]
*  To be in the bottom ten [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2284.78s)]
*  27 and a half exactly and that's probably in the bottom ten. That's 31 wins last year after he was you said a [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2287.82s)]
*  disastrous like [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2294.86s)]
*  Torch job to it like Colin six Sexton was good right last year some of these young guys like either Kianthey or Taylor [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2296.02s)]
*  You know Filipowski pretty incredible. This is the most guys that you've watched tape on trying to figure out how much you like them [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2304.42s)]
*  Yeah, cuz like I'm gonna crunch them sense about again [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2311.5s)]
*  Juzang I got Jason Preston had the commercial that everybody Cody Williams you were fascinated by [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2315.1s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't really get that one and then the Filipowski stuff. It was like we'll take you buddy [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2319.98s)]
*  I'm enriched by having John Collins player option hanging around. I bet he exercises it playing [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2328.62s)]
*  26 and a half million recording right now [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2336.9s)]
*  Is reported [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2341.5s)]
*  Credit to agent at Excel going over will Hardy fuck it. Let's roll. Oh my god. Really you're going over. Yeah, they're too well coached I [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2343.22s)]
*  Think I think this is the last I think they told will Hardy one more year of this and then we'll start trying to be good [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2352.34s)]
*  Would be my guess Walker Kessler because the Denver would do for Walker Kessler [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2358.42s)]
*  Well, I think there's a try to get them the Knicks try to they were like pursuing them all summer before they finally [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2362.98s)]
*  I don't want to say sorry only 55 games last year too, and they still won 31 [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2369.38s)]
*  Yeah, but the West wasn't what it is this year. Well, it wasn't terrible. It's not it's a completely different landscape better [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2374.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay, but I mean one of the other things it was kind of weird about this season [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2381.62s)]
*  What should make it easier is that there wasn't that much movement like a lot of these teams feel pretty similar [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2384.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you guys felt that house did house breeze for this [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2390.7000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2394.62s)]
*  Utah's [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2397.58s)]
*  We have all these different teams that have all these picks and you say they have a ton of picks [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2398.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't love the Utah picks you mentioned they they have basically all their own except for the one you mentioned [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2403.66s)]
*  They have a bunch of many in Cleveland picks [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2409.98s)]
*  For the rest of the decade, which I'm just not that excited about Cleveland locked down their team. They're good [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2413.62s)]
*  We'll be talking about them later, Minnesota [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2419.02s)]
*  I'm pretty bullish on for the rest of the decade and that's really all they have so the big one they have in [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2421.7s)]
*  27 they can swap picks with the Lakers and God only knows he's gonna be in the late [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2428.54s)]
*  Is it top four protected? I think is that what it is top four? That's what I have. Yeah, you're right the research [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2432.34s)]
*  But other than that weekend was so they have good good batch of picks [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2439.1s)]
*  But not any pick like the okay sees like we have this these two quipper picks and they're incredible [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2443.58s)]
*  And we could probably trade this for some things can change though quickly because you're also talking about like 27 28 29 unprotected [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2450.22s)]
*  Minnesota's I think a top five protected in 20. I mean who knows this league [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2457.4199999999996s)]
*  No, is it something really weird would have to happen? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2461.8199999999997s)]
*  I would say with Minnesota because Edwards by the end of this decade will be 27 Edwards would be a Laker dude [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2464.8199999999997s)]
*  You think I just want to see your face? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2470.7799999999997s)]
*  Trying to think how that's gonna be aggregated [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2475.7799999999997s)]
*  We're still oh says Edwards no [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2478.78s)]
*  Simmons disputes were silo rumor Simmons eviscerates were silo rumor without words [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2481.82s)]
*  Simmons torches were silo take [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2487.94s)]
*  Future in doubt so you're going over [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2490.86s)]
*  Will Hardy okay, I am under rolling up the sleeves guy loves a challenge house I am over [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2495.6200000000003s)]
*  Just out of over brothers. It's fine. Here's here's the thing [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2503.86s)]
*  There's only two bad teams in the West. There's between five and seven teams that are bad in the East and [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2507.94s)]
*  Utah needs to be in the top ten [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2514.98s)]
*  Keep that pick and I think that has to be somewhere in the 20s. I think 30 wins is still bottom ten [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2517.34s)]
*  Well, here's the team that's not gonna win 30 games the Portland Trailblazers. They're over under is 20 [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2523.94s)]
*  They're 80 in one to make the playoffs 80 to 1. They're 21 and 6 to win last year. They added Klingon [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2529.98s)]
*  They added houses guy. I have the you let you in an abloving. I've the he made a giant leap last [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2537.08s)]
*  Yeah, he really played contracts incredible by the way [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2542.44s)]
*  Do you realize what that contract is four years 55 million and it actually goes down so in the fourth back later [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2545.04s)]
*  It's eleven point eight seven five. Mm-hmm. So it's the bub Carrington pick and then you know [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2550.36s)]
*  Most face second most favorable of all these three picks in 29. So they lost Malcolm Brognen [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2555.8399999999997s)]
*  They gained Robert Williams back of Celtics fame [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2561.92s)]
*  They added your guy Devante Graham who swung the playoffs when he made a couple shots against Denver last year [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2565.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll get you 20 you get in the looks first question [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2571.6s)]
*  Are these the [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2576.36s)]
*  2024 25 trade machine all-stars totally. Oh, yeah. Wow [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2577.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll give you because I have to have dreams that fit that Deandre Hayton 34 and 35 next two years [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2582.08s)]
*  Anthony Simon's 26 and 28 I can offer you Jeremy Grant 29 32 34 [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2587.7200000000003s)]
*  Danny I have the a great contract for so just spelled it out Rob Williams need a big guy. I think not gonna play [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2594.0s)]
*  You don't think he's gonna play well, he's hurt even when he's healthy. He's hurt. Remember the 22 final [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2600.44s)]
*  February but he feels like a February trade so they have multiple guys that I think [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2605.16s)]
*  Will be a lot of grief. I kind of liked him a little [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2610.56s)]
*  Thibold [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2614.52s)]
*  You know who's who's that guy they have that I love tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, they won't trade him. He's not available [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2616.68s)]
*  But I'm going under I think this team's gonna suck and will be the worst team in the West house. It's under yeah [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2623.56s)]
*  No, no hesitation reservation Chauncey billups got into the Hall of Fame. That's gonna be his [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2630.4s)]
*  You know the thing he gets a hang his hat on for the season [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2636.36s)]
*  There was a funny thing at the end of last year that I know we're still a loved word [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2639.04s)]
*  Deandre and put together like I've got six weeks of good games [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2642.72s)]
*  I want it you want the numbers want the splits but then puffed his chest out a little bit about it [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2645.8s)]
*  You're finally getting to see the real me people don't understand that I've accomplished everything except individual accomplishments and team accomplishments [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2650.04s)]
*  So they didn't say that but I'm waiting for a player to actually say it at some point [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2657.6400000000003s)]
*  So Aitin is still only 26. Yeah for the all-star game [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2662.96s)]
*  He just didn't shoot a lot and other guys just shot all the time [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2666.62s)]
*  So he's 14 10 to 56 percent from the floor only 18 games after the all-star break [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2669.8s)]
*  He's 23 12 and a half a couple assists 58 percent he doesn't shoot any free throws anymore [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2675.32s)]
*  Not that he was a high free throw guy even in Phoenix [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2681.4s)]
*  but there'll be somebody that will talk themselves into him as an option because [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2684.7200000000003s)]
*  There's some teams that need centers out there now [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2691.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know, you know, you're talking about a significant investment in that I mean like the morelands a team that does not have a center [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2693.0400000000004s)]
*  Doesn't have one right now. Yeah, I don't they would have to get kind of creative. Of course [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2698.5600000000004s)]
*  Nothing's really impossible in this league, but I'm not I don't think Aitin [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2702.4s)]
*  necessarily loves the whole part of you've got to go out there and [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2706.44s)]
*  Play there's fans outside. Yeah playing part. Yeah, but [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2711.12s)]
*  To be here he's so talented he's so gifted physically and all this stuff like look at those numbers [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2716.6800000000003s)]
*  He gave you post all-star. So he had a nice run and then [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2721.32s)]
*  You know scoot had a nice little nice little pre and post split where he basically just shot more [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2725.44s)]
*  Wait, can you hold this? Yeah, go ahead. No this is a good part finished. Yeah, you're right [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2731.56s)]
*  We should that should be the end of the Portland segment [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2736.08s)]
*  How so they've been better off taking the Miami trade. Oh [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2739.04s)]
*  That's a great question hero. Yo bitch Duncan Robinson to Miami first and one Miami swap [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2742.36s)]
*  And instead they did Aitin drew holiday a [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2748.88s)]
*  Milwaukee [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2752.4s)]
*  2029 first and two Milwaukee swaps [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2753.4s)]
*  So I'm gonna make the case. They actually still did the right thing [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2756.2s)]
*  I just don't think they got enough for Drew. I agree with this if it weren't Miami, would you say I think so? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2759.32s)]
*  Here's the thing. I was just telling somebody this the other day [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2764.8s)]
*  Miami and their whole little annoying media machine that they have [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2768.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, fucked up that Portland situation to that point Joe Cronin and the poor and people were like we were never trading with those fucking [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2771.88s)]
*  Guys and they end up making the Dame trade [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2778.1200000000003s)]
*  They get drew back and now they're like Drew's like I want to be an contender like we got you [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2781.32s)]
*  We're gonna trade you a contender and they still won't trade him to Miami the team that probably needed him the most right and [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2786.2799999999997s)]
*  All the shit Miami did that summer led to them not getting drew holiday who also would have blocked Boston from getting drew holiday [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2792.3599999999997s)]
*  Instead they had a settle for Rozier in February. What did they do? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2799.0s)]
*  What do you say all the shit they did what if like they tried to force? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2802.3199999999997s)]
*  They did 90 different ways about how fucking stupid Portland was for not taking their hero deal and we were calling it on the podcast [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2808.4399999999996s)]
*  all these different media people that [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2816.6s)]
*  Let's be honest are a little Miami Heat friendly and they were super aggro bad [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2819.12s)]
*  Well, but everybody else is wrong was my favorite part. Yeah, it was like no everybody else is wrong [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2823.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like so your bias is the right one [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2828.56s)]
*  Got it [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2830.56s)]
*  I think Portland got pissed off because the fact that they didn't trade drew to Miami tells me they were pissed off [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2831.2s)]
*  Plus I've heard they were pissed off. Look hero was so bad in that Celtic series [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2836.56s)]
*  especially like I mean [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2842.24s)]
*  Miami was was struggling for bodies. So normally you wouldn't be like hey, you're checking [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2844.24s)]
*  We have to put Caleb on Tatum. So you're gonna be playing [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2848.68s)]
*  You're gonna be going Jaylen Brown and those games have started be like this is this is ugly [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2853.24s)]
*  Like heroes a really talented guy, but he probably profiles like a little lower than than he does [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2858.3599999999997s)]
*  He wasn't what Portland needed and then with the contract like I could totally understand Portland going [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2863.72s)]
*  We don't need another [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2868.52s)]
*  Like guy that just kind of comes in that sort of a high-level shot making [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2870.04s)]
*  Yeah, like flawed player and all these different things. So I I [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2874.34s)]
*  Don't know the eight and part of it. It depends on what you think of eight and it depends on what you think of eight [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2878.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, would you rather you and I were higher on him than most? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2882.52s)]
*  But I feel like they needed to know that holiday trade [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2885.76s)]
*  Maybe the other team was the Clippers because I think the Clippers were pretty desperate pre [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2888.52s)]
*  Hardened trade to do something make something happen and that that could have been another place for [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2892.52s)]
*  All right. This is an important part of the podcast. It's a new gimmick for the overenders. We're new an investor relations call [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2897.96s)]
*  And in tell you this is coming it's scoot Henderson stock we do this call once a year [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2907.1600000000003s)]
*  We have some which we only do once a year. I feel yeah, it's seven some calling the meeting in order [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2914.2000000000003s)]
*  Rosilla how we feel it we feel like [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2921.4s)]
*  the [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2925.44s)]
*  The analysis was correct, but the outcome is wrong [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2926.64s)]
*  Tremendous upside still all the upside that we imagined is there but we have a guy [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2931.4s)]
*  Jaylen sucks down at Orlando branch who still is bullish on scoot. So we're gonna follow his lead on this train. Yeah [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2937.56s)]
*  Gotta be honest the goggles freaked me out a little [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2945.2s)]
*  I wish I had known about the eyesight before before we bought that big position on scoot the breakout video of the preseason stuff [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2947.3199999999997s)]
*  Where he said, what did you learn? He was like the food scared me a bit [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2954.68s)]
*  And it's not it's not wrong which food they were like, what'd you learn about your first year? He's like all the food [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2959.08s)]
*  Damn it. How about slashing cake? I'm not giving up but we can't we can't [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2967.3999999999996s)]
*  There's no way [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2975.2s)]
*  It's a hold position. It's a hold position. Okay, I would tell [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2977.2s)]
*  investors though [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2982.48s)]
*  We've got to diversify it a little bit [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2983.88s)]
*  The DASDAQ 500 looking good guys [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2988.04s)]
*  20% of your position on this [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2991.8s)]
*  He was terrible, but here's a stat for you. Yeah, so if you go per 100 possessions all players in the NBA [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=2995.4s)]
*  scoot [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3002.84s)]
*  Was the second worst in turnovers per 100 possessions now? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3003.96s)]
*  That's fool's gold sometimes the biggest mistakes and evaluated are made during those last six weeks of the NBA season where guys are mailing it [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3008.8s)]
*  And you don't really know who's playing but at least we had something right at least like Caleb Williams against the bad NFL teams after [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3015.6000000000004s)]
*  a tough couple games like [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3021.44s)]
*  Caleb Williams in front of three bad defenses. You start feeling better about Caleb Williams. I can't even like enjoy the bad games or the bad [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3023.44s)]
*  Opponents with cameras all that so anyway, so second worst on the turnover per 100 possessions [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3031.44s)]
*  So anyway, so second worst on the turnover per 100 guess who's number one Wemby so we're good Wow [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3035.92s)]
*  All right, that's weird you're doing the meeting over [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3045.4s)]
*  Over. Oh, yeah over so you'd went over on everybody except Denver [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3048.08s)]
*  Did I over on Portland? Yeah, why low number? It is a low number. It's true [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3053.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's not low enough in my opinion [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3058.88s)]
*  Alright the southwest includes the Dallas Mavericks that made the NBA finals last year and have an over-under of 50 and a half wins [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3061.8s)]
*  They are plus 130 for the division five to one for the conference 11 for the title [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3070.36s)]
*  plus 650 one seed [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3074.76s)]
*  Last year, there are 50 and 32 [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3077.2400000000002s)]
*  They finished 24 and 9 in the last 33 games and then 12 and 5 in the first three rounds they had a 28 and 9 stretch [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3080.28s)]
*  At some point for the at the finals and I feel like that's the Dallas team we're getting even before [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3088.36s)]
*  We talk about all the ads and the drops. They lost Eric Jones. They lost Hardaway jr. They lost Josh Green [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3094.52s)]
*  They added clay they added Marshall. They had a Grimes added Dinwiddie. I [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3099.8s)]
*  Don't understand why this team wouldn't be like a least of 52 and 30 team and that's before we get into the Luca MVP stuff [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3104.32s)]
*  Rossello [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3112.52s)]
*  Is Dallas better worse or the same this season? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3113.9599999999996s)]
*  They're better because I really like what they did. I love Najee Marshall. We all know that I even like the Grimes pick up [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3118.04s)]
*  Um a full season with Gafford and Washington, but then having a lively combination there and then you know, jaden hardy who I thought was just [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3124.4399999999996s)]
*  like really scary except [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3131.8799999999997s)]
*  Amazing athletically coming out in the draft like you've just seen a few moments with him [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3134.4399999999996s)]
*  Even if he's just green light as soon as he laces him up, I think they're better, but I still went under [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3138.04s)]
*  Wow by a hair. Yeah, it's interesting shocked. Okay. Well, it's 50 and a half and they won 50 last year [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3143.72s)]
*  So you're saying they win 50 again this year 49. Yeah, I mean it's just more about the west [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3149.56s)]
*  I mean you could even break through some of the numbers where [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3154.84s)]
*  You know, it's funny because there's a lot of stuff [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3158.2s)]
*  Where it was like oh you have to ignore the year-long numbers because they're a different team now and the defensive numbers are better [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3161.0s)]
*  And all this stuff and like some of it improves like there's a defensive jump in there [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3166.84s)]
*  Offensively, they're basically the same three-point stuff [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3170.98s)]
*  They're basically the same but they were 12th in net rating post all-star break and they made it to the nba finals [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3173.2400000000002s)]
*  What about the super bowl hangover though? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3178.76s)]
*  I don't see it with with them. Oh, sorry. I got screwed up wrong sport. Oh, there's a little kairi baked into that too. Maybe [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3181.32s)]
*  Okay, okay, like kairi. We did get the very best said and did all the right things last year [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3187.4s)]
*  He's like ripkin right now [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3193.4s)]
*  It's great point. It's a great put wow see in my I didn't put factor into my analysis [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3196.04s)]
*  The kairi variance what's 48 or 49 like that's what i'm thinking. I don't I don't think they're gonna be bad [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3201.88s)]
*  It's the same luca premise, but the number was so low last year [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3206.6s)]
*  And not mature not mature kairi. This is just who he is now [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3210.04s)]
*  Maybe it is who he is. I mean, that's great. That'd be awesome, you know, but he also the funny thing is he completely skates [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3214.2000000000003s)]
*  Through having awful playoff performances now because really bad in the finals [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3220.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a good point and I think he wanted it so bad because it was boston like, you know [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3224.6800000000003s)]
*  He's burning the sage and he's talking about all the stuff and none of it matters and what his time there's a game three [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3229.1600000000003s)]
*  Money's a construct and it's like yeah [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3234.04s)]
*  But you really want to stick it to boston like it fucked you up a bit out there game three [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3235.8s)]
*  Yeah, which I watched over the summer when luca gets he fouls out with what four minutes left and there's that moment where it seems like [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3240.2000000000003s)]
*  This would be amazing if kairi ends up saving the day here and making it a two one series and it was all set up on [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3247.16s)]
*  A platform and then he didn't come through. Yeah, and there was a sampling that of the nets where he decided [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3253.48s)]
*  Oh, i'm gonna try to take these it's over and we said this after the finals boston fans should cheer him now [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3257.96s)]
*  It's over. It's like when we tuned revera. Yeah, just like 2005 opening day. Yeah, that was awesome [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3263.16s)]
*  That was the fucking best. Uh how he smiled too remember revera just started like he left but that's revera was the it was so hard [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3269.48s)]
*  And not like revera. Um, I mean I hated him but yeah, no, but you but he was one of those guys where you're like [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3275.88s)]
*  Yeah, this guy's cool. I think I mother fucked him for like eight straight years. But yeah, no, he's awesome house luca is [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3282.04s)]
*  33 nine and nine the last two seasons [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3288.58s)]
*  He is 30.9 points a game and 50 playoff games second behind just mj [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3291.88s)]
*  He's 28.7 points a game for his career, which is uh, only jordan and wilder higher [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3296.6800000000003s)]
*  He might have had the best six season statistical start to a career since cream of duljubar [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3302.2000000000003s)]
*  Has no mvp's house [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3311.4s)]
*  I think he wins the mvp this year, which is why one of the reasons i'm going over I think and the mvp odds [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3314.2000000000003s)]
*  Not a lot of bet on it [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3320.92s)]
*  But I think he's the logical mvp choice this year because in beads out yoke edge nobody [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3322.52s)]
*  He's there's I don't know what he would have to do to win another mvp [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3327.6400000000003s)]
*  I just don't think anyone's voting for him again and [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3330.2s)]
*  Unless edward steps up or sga averages 32 a game [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3333.08s)]
*  Sga would be that would like a one seed with luca [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3337.08s)]
*  Yeah, if you had to do like an mvp bracket, who would the one seeds be? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3339.8799999999997s)]
*  It's probably ant sga and luca because if okay, see goes 64 and 18 [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3342.8399999999997s)]
*  And sga averages last year. Yeah [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3348.2s)]
*  But I would great in the voting [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3351.72s)]
*  Right, I would I would pick luca because I just would find it hard to believe he's not going to win an mvp [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3353.3199999999997s)]
*  Because he's too good [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3358.44s)]
*  I feel the exact same way [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3359.6400000000003s)]
*  I am super over on this dallas team [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3361.08s)]
*  the only thing that can derail it is is injuries and it's you have to say it like with a little more oomph in this situation because [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3363.4s)]
*  kairi and luca have both missed chunks of time over the years, but [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3370.1200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3374.2000000000003s)]
*  It is I let my notes say luca mvp year [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3374.92s)]
*  They went 24 9 over the last 33 years seven, which is always a good. Yeah good time [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3378.28s)]
*  Yeah, uh luca plus 330 on fanduil shay is plus 410 [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3382.92s)]
*  yokich 480 [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3387.72s)]
*  Yannis 8 to 1 edwards 9 to 1 brunson is 12 to 1 and I don't think anyone else has it [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3389.08s)]
*  I have them basically taking the place of denver in denver 57 wins last year [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3394.6s)]
*  I have dallas jumping all the way up there in denver going back down [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3399.96s)]
*  They're basically trading spots. It sounds like a lock for you. I'm getting i'm it's going to be close [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3402.52s)]
*  I have it in brackets right now. But yeah, I really like what they did [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3406.7599999999998s)]
*  I think they got better [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3410.2s)]
*  I think the guys that they brought in are better than the three that they um said goodbye farewell to [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3411.24s)]
*  I have another question for your house. Go ahead [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3416.3599999999997s)]
*  On the on the scale of stars reinventing themselves as role players on new teams [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3420.04s)]
*  with [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3425.64s)]
*  2001 mitch richmond being the lowest [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3426.74s)]
*  In 2013 ray allen being the highest [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3429.48s)]
*  Where is clay thompson going to be? Oh, wow. I like it closer to ray allen [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3432.92s)]
*  I think they're just going to ask so little of him [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3436.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think that they need a ton and and it's going to be splashy when he comes in and hits, you know [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3439.0s)]
*  Five threes and a quarter. It was like, oh my god, they have clay. Look at what clay did [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3444.52s)]
*  I don't think that they're going to put the pressure on him [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3448.6000000000004s)]
*  To do anything. It was too much pressure [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3451.48s)]
*  He couldn't do what golden state needed him to do last year [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3453.7200000000003s)]
*  I think he'll be fine for what else he's gonna ask of him [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3457.0s)]
*  He still averaged 18 a game [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3459.48s)]
*  but then when you get through the summer and you read some of the stories and some of the quotes and even some of [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3460.84s)]
*  The stuff draymond and steve kerr and curry said [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3464.92s)]
*  It really seemed like he was a mess last year emotionally [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3468.1200000000003s)]
*  It does seem like that. I think he had a lot of a lot of trouble with the last two years and [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3471.8s)]
*  Especially when he didn't get the contract [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3477.08s)]
*  He just seemed like a mess and it and even people who loved him and played with him forever were like he needed a fresh start [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3479.4s)]
*  Now, I don't know what point of his career is that I didn't think he could play defense anymore. We're still [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3486.28s)]
*  I think he could guard anybody. No, I don't think he can guard anybody either but me either [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3490.12s)]
*  I mean if you threw if you asked him to be like, hey [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3493.8s)]
*  What do you think clay shot the last couple years from three? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3496.36s)]
*  And people be so he was like 41 39. Yeah high like almost 10 attempts per game [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3499.0s)]
*  I would agree on the defensive side. I would agree on the same like animosity and the contract stuff like [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3504.04s)]
*  You know, there was a number out there and then he didn't take it and then he like damn [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3509.56s)]
*  I kind of wish I had taken that and then it looked like old state was totally fine [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3512.84s)]
*  We're trying to reinvent stuff around stef whatever version of this is that we'll get to but I like it for him [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3517.0s)]
*  I like it for him because I just think off of two [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3522.36s)]
*  creative guys that have so much attention like clay's job is going to be like really easy [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3524.68s)]
*  Do not leave him alone totally agree with this and he averaged 18 a game last year, which I'd forgotten [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3532.3599999999997s)]
*  And by the way, like a whole bench thing. Remember like when we got his emotion like I love clay [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3537.16s)]
*  Okay, i'm a huge clay fan. I will always be and so even all the bumpiness and him being what he was honest [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3541.24s)]
*  He felt real. He was fucking oddly funny like in a goofy kind of fun way [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3547.56s)]
*  And if you want to knock him over like we've got access to so many of these guys for so many years that there's always going [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3552.92s)]
*  To be something like oh, I think I disagree with that [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3557.56s)]
*  But like I loved his personality and his approach throughout all of it [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3559.8s)]
*  Because it felt so genuine in comparison with some of the other guys. So [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3564.76s)]
*  I [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3568.92s)]
*  I'm just gonna have a hard time like [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3570.12s)]
*  Being upset with anything about like I hope this works out for him [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3573.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think it's going to be really really easy like pj and jones had those incredible like moments shooting from three [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3577.48s)]
*  Yeah, but it was there was a real like variation there with both of those guys [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3583.88s)]
*  My fear might not manifest itself until the playoffs is you're just putting out [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3590.44s)]
*  Luca kairi and clay all together. I'm not gonna be able to guard anybody [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3596.6s)]
*  I can't guard anybody with those three just nausea comes in saves the day. I can't wait for I can't wait for dallas [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3602.04s)]
*  To experience nausea marshal. Did people know they're under [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3608.04s)]
*  Well, but like a game, you know fine [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3612.92s)]
*  Nausea marshal is going to be there's been there were very few totals where I went. That's stupid [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3616.2000000000003s)]
*  What's your crunch time for this team? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3620.36s)]
*  When round two well, i've been still listed as a backup, I guess but um [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3622.84s)]
*  Is clay crunch time for you? Is he a bench guy? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3628.6800000000003s)]
*  Because I don't think he can be a crunch time guy for this team if you're also going to play luca and kairi [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3631.96s)]
*  No, it's it's you're just hunting everybody because like imagine against okc. Yeah [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3636.44s)]
*  That's the thing like all their swings could play defense last year and clay [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3643.48s)]
*  Unless something changed [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3647.7200000000003s)]
*  All right. So i'm over rousselo is under ladder work 50 and a half in house is over [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3650.04s)]
*  All right [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3657.2400000000002s)]
*  The memphis grizzlies a team that I have changed my opinion on they're over under multiple times mainly because it keeps going up house [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3657.88s)]
*  It's at 47 and a half now [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3664.52s)]
*  Fantastic plus 270 for the division that sounds like an under [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3666.7599999999998s)]
*  14 to one one seed playoff minus 245 [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3672.1s)]
*  Last year, they were 27 and 55 everybody was hurt [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3677.64s)]
*  They added zac edie marcus smarts coming back. We'll see what [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3681.8s)]
*  What stage of his career he's in? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3686.52s)]
*  jaron jackson's already hurt [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3689.48s)]
*  He didn't decide to do it during the season this year he said fuck it and it happened before the season [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3691.72s)]
*  Jaws back and you take a special joy in memphis injuries and I don't know if it's because of urno or what is it [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3697.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a little bit of yeah [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3703.96s)]
*  No, but they've had I mean they've had bad luck like brain and clark tearing his achilles. That sucks bad luck, but um jaron jackson [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3705.32s)]
*  I do have suspicions of [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3712.6s)]
*  His skinny body banging bodies for eight months a year like it's just it's a lot to ask [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3716.52s)]
*  But now they have zac edie. We'll talk about edie island later [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3721.72s)]
*  I am a under I was way more excited about this when it was like 44 and a half 47 half [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3726.28s)]
*  With all the variables with all the injury stuff with that fact that they're counting on edie who I really like [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3732.36s)]
*  I don't know what version of marcus smart we're getting anymore. I don't know if jaws heads on straight [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3738.04s)]
*  House it's an under for me. It is an easy under for me. Um [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3743.32s)]
*  Because they can win 47 games and I still win the bet and that's 20 game improvement which seems like the right amount of improvement [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3747.56s)]
*  For the chemistry experiment that they're about to undertake and it has been a chemistry experiment [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3755.16s)]
*  You know now for for three seasons going on now because jaw can't be on the court and triple j can't be on the court [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3760.36s)]
*  and [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3767.8s)]
*  Experiment is very generous [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3768.6800000000003s)]
*  noun [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3770.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean some would say [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3773.2400000000002s)]
*  A controversy late in three years. You just want a rotation [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3775.3199999999997s)]
*  Can you have eight guys that are going to play and they say oh, this is our rotation and then next year [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3779.56s)]
*  Oh, it's the basically the same eight guys. Maybe we saw somebody in they just don't have that [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3784.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, they also have they were relying on these young dudes last year who I really liked like gg. Jackson vince williams [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3788.9199999999996s)]
*  And I wonder if there's a little bit of a 2019 celtics thing. We're still on query. Who is he's hurt [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3795.08s)]
*  How long is he out for he's out like two months? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3800.2s)]
*  Two more months, so he had foot surgery a month ago reevaluated in three months. Jesus. No [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3803.08s)]
*  Triple j's out ggs. I don't want to edit that. You know what even the greats [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3808.7599999999998s)]
*  Hey, you lost track of a hurt grizzly. It's okay. I lost I lost track of the 11th man on the grizzlies [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3812.68s)]
*  But yeah, it's just a lot of variables for me where do you stand racila over great [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3819.72s)]
*  Uh, look, it's my favorite stat. It is my favorite stat of any of the preparation over the last week [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3824.52s)]
*  33 players played in a game for the grizzlies last year [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3831.96s)]
*  33 like I was looking through minute dispersal trying to look at all the injury stuff. Yeah, like okay [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3836.5s)]
*  How many games the guys play who was your favorite guy that played? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3841.64s)]
*  Was there maybe vince williams? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3845.72s)]
*  I meant just favorite. I can't believe he did he played a minute for that team guy [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3848.52s)]
*  I thought jeff malone getting a few minutes was surprising jeff malone from the 80s. Yeah [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3852.2s)]
*  He's back he was working in home depot and they were like the corner three [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3856.12s)]
*  Do you want to you want to get some run in and they were he was like, oh pick up [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3860.6s)]
*  I love this and they were like, no, it's actually a game. So I have no the home depot thing's not true. Um [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3863.96s)]
*  Look they went 51 and 31 they went 56 and 26 the previous two seasons [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3870.44s)]
*  I saw the recent jaw ad campaign where I was like, oh so okay [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3874.84s)]
*  This is what we're doing [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3879.1600000000003s)]
*  And in reality, I started thinking about a little bit more [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3880.6s)]
*  I think for the grizzlies to be the best version of themselves and for jaw to be the best version of himself is he needs to [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3882.8399999999997s)]
*  Be without blame. He needs to be delusional. He needs to think everybody else is wrong [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3887.96s)]
*  And just attack attack attack. Okay, I don't want him thinking about anything [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3893.24s)]
*  I want him just going to the rim with this ferocity that made us all fall in love with him in the beginning [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3897.3999999999996s)]
*  I think he's paid his dues as far as the punishment part of it. I don't want him reflective [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3902.2s)]
*  I don't want him to see him mature. I want him irrationally [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3906.68s)]
*  This sounds like the last four episodes of the menendez brother show [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3910.54s)]
*  Uh, because he's not going to do [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3914.78s)]
*  He's not going to do any of the stuff that public wants him to do and that might be better suited for him to just get [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3917.34s)]
*  Back into the court and attack and so I don't think they're gonna have even like there's no way [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3921.82s)]
*  Like bane played 42 games clark played six triple j actually played 66 marks and only smartly played 20 games now [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3926.78s)]
*  Everybody's favorite player is zach edie, which I think is maybe a little bit too much momentum on that one [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3933.82s)]
*  Um, the number is higher because of what they've been together. So i'm actually going to go the other way with this and go over [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3939.1800000000003s)]
*  I love it. It's fine. I don't feel I enjoy it super strongly about it either way [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3944.0600000000004s)]
*  I just there were more things that made me nervous about going over than under just I could see them going 52 and 30 [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3947.82s)]
*  They'd be fine. I it doesn't seem likely to me without triple j, but you know, they also could be a mess [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3953.98s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I I this was one of three teams where I was like, all right [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3960.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm doing the if my life depended on it [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3965.1800000000003s)]
*  What would I do? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3967.98s)]
*  I was like I just [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3969.34s)]
*  Going over on a team that has this many variables. I like the over a lot more last night [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3970.7000000000003s)]
*  No, I somebody had what was happening last night. Somebody had taken [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3975.34s)]
*  Watch that ad I think I was the first time I saw the jaw ad and I went [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3979.34s)]
*  Hey instead of being upset and like this guy's not taking any account. I was like good [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3982.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's do the jam around outcome pie chart house [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3987.7400000000002s)]
*  And the the outcomes can be first or second team on ba [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3992.86s)]
*  all-star [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=3998.1400000000003s)]
*  Good starter injury prone [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4000.1400000000003s)]
*  Or it's a mess again [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4002.7000000000003s)]
*  What would you where would you put the percentages what would you do first or second team all mba like 12 15? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4005.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, not very big. That's a pretty small slice. What about devastating hip dislocation? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4011.6600000000003s)]
*  No, my god, jeez 5 don't do that. Come on. I would say first team [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4017.1800000000003s)]
*  It would have to be really special god. They were so good [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4023.9s)]
*  They were so good there for a little stretch. It's not like [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4027.1s)]
*  I would say probably 10 to 12 all-star to me seems in like the 25 to 30. That's the biggest slice of pie to me [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4030.38s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I do like good starter injury prone is probably second biggest. I just don't want to root for that [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4036.8599999999997s)]
*  But you're right. I'm we're doing out high blame pie [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4041.2599999999998s)]
*  And then he's a mess off the court. No, and this season goes badly is probably 10 percent. I [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4045.2599999999998s)]
*  This is where I don't know how popular this is but like when we say mess off the court in the historic moments of people [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4051.66s)]
*  being a mess off the court like [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4057.18s)]
*  Distraction that causes him to miss games. Yeah, sure, but like [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4060.6s)]
*  If you want to go through all the guys go through like the 70s and 80s [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4065.74s)]
*  Well, we didn't have to do that. You can do recent stuff like jaws not in the same [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4069.66s)]
*  Tier of some of these guys that are fucked up [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4074.22s)]
*  My guess is all-star [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4077.82s)]
*  but he also [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4079.82s)]
*  Those guys also were not supposed to be the face of the league because we we you know [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4080.94s)]
*  The league was hoping two years ago that job would be the face [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4085.02s)]
*  I know what happened with edwards was what they wanted to happen with job two years ago, right? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4087.82s)]
*  Most exciting social media all-star american player [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4095.02s)]
*  edwards kind of took it so [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4098.94s)]
*  There's a there's a scenario where he's awesome this year partly because edwards took the spot that was [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4100.94s)]
*  Therefore I like this. Um [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4107.02s)]
*  It's a zac ed investors relations call [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4110.620000000001s)]
*  We've taken a position on zac edie the ninth pick in the draft. Um [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4114.46s)]
*  I just I think he's going to be pretty good for them [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4120.620000000001s)]
*  I'm excited to watch him because he's a weird mba player in a league where everybody is looking increasingly the same [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4122.860000000001s)]
*  I like that. He has to be out at the end of games because he can get fouled and we'll make the last two free throws [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4129.5s)]
*  I think he's gonna be really hard to guard. I think there's gonna be certain matchups where they're like, Jesus christ zac edie [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4134.860000000001s)]
*  Has 18 points in the first half. There's gonna be other games where it's like wow, they can't [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4139.18s)]
*  hide him on defense [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4143.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna I recommend a [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4146.54s)]
*  Small purchase of edie stock here. Okay [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4149.26s)]
*  You in house [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4153.34s)]
*  For verno [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4155.66s)]
*  Very small buy i'll add some edie to the portfolio, but it's like it's spec money. It's resello [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4157.18s)]
*  Um [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4163.26s)]
*  Look, here's what I would ask [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4164.86s)]
*  Are you actually going to throw it to him in the post? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4167.26s)]
*  like you're going you're going to do that because [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4170.78s)]
*  If we go [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4174.38s)]
*  Who led the league in post-ups last year? It was yokich with eight. All right [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4175.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh, and bead was second at less than five [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4181.34s)]
*  So that's not what anybody does al jefferson led the league in post-up touches like post like real post-ups [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4185.02s)]
*  Okay, al jefferson, um like with 20 [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4190.860000000001s)]
*  And it was only like 10 years ago if you could redo al jefferson or d brown's career and you could only redo one [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4193.9800000000005s)]
*  Which one would you redo? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4199.66s)]
*  Big al man [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4203.02s)]
*  I just feel like he had bad luck for three straight years with dumb injuries. I know I loved him [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4204.78s)]
*  I loved him because he just you know, I thought he could have been a 25 point a game guy [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4209.02s)]
*  He was unguardable on the block. He had great feet great hands. I didn't even know that his body bad luck, you know, but [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4213.18s)]
*  So the ed like if you're telling me the guy that lit it up like sometimes you're like, okay [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4219.42s)]
*  Well, he's seven four [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4224.46s)]
*  I just didn't think a team would actually want to run an offense that way because nobody does it anymore [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4225.42s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess if you're gonna take him in the top 10 [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4230.38s)]
*  Then it means you're going to do something that nobody does anymore. I think the number five guy in post-ups [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4234.46s)]
*  Was shangoon at three point eight a game [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4239.9s)]
*  So is ed getting 10 and then shangoo got hurt and then houston played better with that [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4243.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. Okay, what's going on here? But that's perfect because then you think of like the best version of jaw [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4247.58s)]
*  Space it out [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4253.1s)]
*  Let him attack [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4254.46s)]
*  No help. So where's zack edie when that's happening two threes his entire college career [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4255.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4260.38s)]
*  So I think the the ed like stuff that we're seeing is it's kind of awesome like good for him, you know [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4260.78s)]
*  but specific to [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4267.42s)]
*  I guess if you invest this kind of picking him you're gonna do that [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4270.62s)]
*  Does that does that get in jaws way a little bit and then of course i'll you know [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4272.9400000000005s)]
*  So sounds like you don't want to buy in on you [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4276.86s)]
*  house and i'll [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4279.26s)]
*  We'll cover you small bit small taste. I'm a little higher on them, but I the job thing. What is it then? What is it? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4280.46s)]
*  Because there's going to be games [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4287.58s)]
*  Okay, like they play new orleans and new orleans is like we still don't have a center herb jones and this messy guy [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4289.58s)]
*  And we may play zion and center and memphis a little bit. That's great [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4296.22s)]
*  We're just going to post up zack edie and he's going to score on all these fucking dudes [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4300.3s)]
*  I think there's games like that. I think he's a situational asset [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4304.78s)]
*  Right. I wouldn't want against the lakers probably not playing [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4309.179999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4312.46s)]
*  Against the warriors if they have draymond. It's like yeah, let's see what this looks like [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4313.42s)]
*  Let's post up draymond a couple times and see how it goes. It might be like a really successful novelty that I don't know [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4316.7s)]
*  It's like a percy harvin [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4323.42s)]
*  It's like those receivers that they're like, yeah, he's gonna we're gonna run options with him and [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4328.0599999999995s)]
*  Weird reverses and swing passes. All right, new orleans speaking of they're over under is 45 and a half [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4332.860000000001s)]
*  and [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4340.38s)]
*  They added to jante murray and daniel teis brasil's favorite player [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4342.54s)]
*  They lost yonkers balance genius [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4346.54s)]
*  They still have brandon ingraham who they made the mistake of saying that they were probably trading during the summer and then nobody made an offer [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4348.780000000001s)]
*  They don't have a center unless you count daniel teis [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4355.5s)]
*  Um zion's in good shape [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4359.58s)]
*  Yeah, he looks good. It's awesome [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4361.82s)]
*  Looks like older and uh just felt like [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4365.66s)]
*  It was a fast forward to four years from now [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4369.74s)]
*  um [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4372.94s)]
*  I'm an under on this at 45 and a half. I don't feel great about it. I think this season's really hard but uh [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4374.0599999999995s)]
*  The west is too good and I have too many questions about what this team is going to do defensively [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4381.9s)]
*  I don't know really [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4386.94s)]
*  How much is ian going to play the murray mccallum ingraham zion as four year five guys just seems super weird to me from a ball [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4389.5s)]
*  Kind of who's going to be happy in that scenario standpoint those seem to be like four guys that need the ball [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4398.38s)]
*  Um [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4404.219999999999s)]
*  It just feels like this team isn't the team they're going to be in february [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4405.9s)]
*  I feel like this is this would be my pick for something weird some trade is going to happen with this team [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4409.259999999999s)]
*  What do you have else? Yeah, i'm in the same boat. Um [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4413.66s)]
*  I feel like a team starting off the season with a guy that they they didn't intend to have on the roster [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4416.86s)]
*  Um feels like feels slightly awkward feels like [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4422.86s)]
*  They're a wizards team basically if you've been in that scenario many times sure andre blatch is back [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4426.0599999999995s)]
*  And I was super blown away by willie green last year [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4431.66s)]
*  I thought down the stretch that new orleans really had uh an opportunity to make some noise getting to the playoffs [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4435.179999999999s)]
*  I really thought because they have a really like dynamic roster in terms of what they can do defensively [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4440.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if everybody's healthy [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4446.94s)]
*  Um the guy that doesn't fit that is ingram which made him so super expendable [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4448.94s)]
*  But he's on the roster. So it's an under for me. I I can't you know, I just can't invest in the idea that [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4453.66s)]
*  There's upside, you know, they won 49 games and their total is 45 and a half. It's crazy [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4460.38s)]
*  And the under is minus 132. So everybody's buying the under on this team and i'm gonna go right along with them. We're still out [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4465.98s)]
*  Larry nance and dice and daniels were in that trade for mary and nance was somebody that was finishing games for them and gave them a little [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4473.58s)]
*  You know, I don't want to say small ball, but a smaller ball and uh, I just thought he was really valuable for them and [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4481.9s)]
*  I don't like the mix of guys enough to go over [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4488.62s)]
*  Say they're gonna be 46 or higher [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4493.0199999999995s)]
*  But you're a zion guy [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4495.9s)]
*  Made it no secret. Yeah [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4499.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, where are you over under under? Um, what happened to the pelicans I love? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4501.02s)]
*  You know [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4507.900000000001s)]
*  Remember a couple years ago. I'd be like, you know, you look one through 13. Yeah, i'll take their one through 13 [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4508.700000000001s)]
*  It's kind of true against anybody. It was for a while now. Dyson daniels is gone [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4513.820000000001s)]
*  Um, maybe they can pick up usman jang i'll be excited about it again, but mary hasn't defended like since san antonio [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4518.9400000000005s)]
*  He's got this defensive rep and I don't see it anymore [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4526.780000000001s)]
*  I like cj like I kind of go man mary cj ingram zion like that should be good enough for a high 40s [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4531.42s)]
*  Win total like it should be 49 or 48 or it's a fantasy team. Whatever. Um, look zions 24 [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4536.860000000001s)]
*  And he played 70 games last year and at the worst possible time he goes out in the player [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4543.9800000000005s)]
*  Playing game, you know like here we go again [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4549.42s)]
*  And you know, he'd played 29 total games the last two years [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4551.34s)]
*  So it's a bit of a zion thing and as much as I like herb [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4553.740000000001s)]
*  And I like train murphy and I think jordan hawkins still has a chance because I thought his shot making in that draft was like [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4556.46s)]
*  The most nba ready shot making and you can get stuck behind all these other dudes like a nausea marshall [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4561.900000000001s)]
*  But I I think the nance point that you made bill [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4567.660000000001s)]
*  It may be a precursor to what we have now with the main rotation [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4571.1s)]
*  Because when you look at that matchup against the thunder you're thinking okay valence unis is massive and now chet's gonna have to deal [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4575.02s)]
*  With him and then the balance unit is getting all these rebounds, right? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4580.06s)]
*  But yet willie green wanted to close with larry nance because he wanted to be more adaptable to all the ball handling you saw with [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4583.0199999999995s)]
*  Thunder. Yeah, so I think that might be part of the reason we have this version now because willie green even said like he's not the five [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4589.0199999999995s)]
*  We're not talking about five. We're talking about positionless. I do think there's some credence to that. Um [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4595.179999999999s)]
*  But it's the end of the day end of the day somebody's gonna have to go to the other centers and it's gonna be herb jones [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4600.62s)]
*  A lot of time. I think there's certain nights [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4604.46s)]
*  Where you go? I don't like that at all dude, like we love herb jones find three guys [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4607.179999999999s)]
*  Not I want herb jones like guarding luca [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4612.0599999999995s)]
*  I want to be guarding everybody sga [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4615.34s)]
*  Yeah [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4617.5s)]
*  Also, they don't really have other defenders like him [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4618.7s)]
*  You know because they got rid of daniels zion's not he's he's better than the disaster. He was at the beginning of his career [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4621.82s)]
*  But even like you bring in trey murphy and hawkins off the bench. Those guys aren't locking anyone down [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4627.74s)]
*  He's trey's trey's pretty active and he's long as hell. So I don't want him guarding luca. No, well, I mean, you know [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4632.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't want him guarding tatum. You're gonna lose those anyway, especially with a luca one [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4637.74s)]
*  This one it already feels weirder than it needs to be before the season starts [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4641.66s)]
*  So that's under for me dog and where did their picks go? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4646.3s)]
*  They have other firsts. They have a milwaukee swap in 26 [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4650.06s)]
*  They have either a bux or new orleans first in uh, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4654.22s)]
*  27 [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4658.6s)]
*  And that's it [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4660.14s)]
*  Like that that lakers trade is basically paid out because they put that [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4661.900000000001s)]
*  That pick in the uh in the murray trade [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4665.740000000001s)]
*  I [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4668.62s)]
*  Said it earlier. I'll say it again. I think [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4670.62s)]
*  Trading trey murphy might be the ultimate move for this team [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4673.34s)]
*  Because I think he would have I think he would bring back the most and it would solve [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4676.86s)]
*  Some of the issues they have but I don't know what the move is. Anyway, i'm going under so we're all under on this [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4680.86s)]
*  geez [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4685.82s)]
*  Tough times [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4687.099999999999s)]
*  I guess we'll find out how good de jante murray is because there's been a lot of excuses the last three years [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4688.46s)]
*  And his stats are good and that's about it houston rockets some action today house [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4693.58s)]
*  We're at 43 and a half for the over under and it dropped down to 42 and a half [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4699.5s)]
*  They're plus 130 to be in the play-in. They're minus 150 to be in the playoffs [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4704.46s)]
*  They added reid shepard. This is the most fun depth chart to look at of any of the 30 teams shangoon jabari [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4710.62s)]
*  dylan brooks [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4718.38s)]
*  jalen green van vleet as the starters shepard thompson eason [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4719.58s)]
*  whitmore [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4725.98s)]
*  racila sky landell [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4727.74s)]
*  steven adams [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4729.9s)]
*  jayshon tate who i sneak in like for a while item 12th. Yeah, even write him down jock landale the spurs didn't know how to use him [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4731.5s)]
*  Is there a bigger high ceiling low baseman team than this? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4739.0199999999995s)]
*  You could talk me into 35 wins. You could tell me they're going 51. Well, I don't know why they're going to win less [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4742.3s)]
*  Why are they going to win less? I don't know [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4747.58s)]
*  And let's just the math of all the wins that are available. Well, there's one there actually, you know [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4749.820000000001s)]
*  I love this theory the too many guys theory [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4753.9800000000005s)]
*  But I do have too many guys too many guys all those guys I listed are like i'm better than that guy [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4756.54s)]
*  I should be playing 30 minutes a game [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4761.5s)]
*  They have a lot of I should be playing 30 minute a game guy would be my fear [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4762.860000000001s)]
*  This feels like a veteran gene and look stones did an awesome job with the roster. He has okay [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4766.3s)]
*  But there's also people that would tell you like you can't do it this way because now you have 15 guys all thinking [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4771.58s)]
*  They're supposed to be in the hall of fame. Yeah [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4775.9s)]
*  But I mean whatever i'd rather like cam wintmore is their ninth guy [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4778.219999999999s)]
*  And I guarantee in practice he's like i'm killing everybody in this practice [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4782.379999999999s)]
*  Right or he's looking at reed shepard the first day of practice being like i'm gonna lose minutes to this guy [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4786.139999999999s)]
*  And then reed shepard makes a 20 footer in his face. Yeah [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4790.7s)]
*  Well, that's another thing like reed shepard might [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4794.7s)]
*  In some cases be more effective than bainvillea like they have these situations where on the one hand you could say well [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4797.66s)]
*  Their bench is going to be awesome and the other hand they're going to be in these weird situations where [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4803.34s)]
*  Somebody might be playing over somebody who's finishing games. We already talked about the shingoon part where they have not [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4807.1s)]
*  Where they were better without them better without jabari smith looked great as a stretch five basically [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4812.3s)]
*  Yeah [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4817.66s)]
*  If there's any coach that I trust [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4819.02s)]
*  To figure it out. It's I was really scared what you were going to say there when you paused [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4821.1s)]
*  You're like if there's any coach I trust I was like no house [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4826.54s)]
*  No [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4830.3s)]
*  To figure it out good to figure it out good play. Yeah good spot. Yeah, we've moved beyond. Yeah [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4832.14s)]
*  No, I think that houston is super duper exciting super loaded to me [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4839.34s)]
*  The biggest challenge is figuring out jalen green. They gotta figure out what they're gonna do with that dude [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4844.62s)]
*  Not sure that he's [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4849.26s)]
*  I feel this is the best i've felt about him. Oh, well, that's great. Okay. Well that helps me [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4851.02s)]
*  It's a super over for me. I love this houston team. I think they're gonna be battling for seven eight [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4855.42s)]
*  I don't even you know [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4860.62s)]
*  I I think they're gonna like have a high enough record as I could they might host the seven eight playing [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4862.38s)]
*  i'm intrigued by the jalen green question to rossola because [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4867.900000000001s)]
*  What did he was like 27 28 a game there for a month? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4872.46s)]
*  It was when shingoon went out. I think it was the okc game like last night. Yeah, there were real moments [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4875.74s)]
*  Where it was like holy shit. This guy's figured it out [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4880.3s)]
*  but [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4883.5s)]
*  There's a lot of guys in this team who need the ball [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4885.26s)]
*  Yeah, it used to be a [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4887.26s)]
*  Bunch of guys playing basketball without each other [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4889.34s)]
*  Right. It was it was like four famous people on a podcast that have all had a really good run [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4892.7s)]
*  And they're like, let's start a podcast this week and you're just like what the fuck fuck you guys doing? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4897.9800000000005s)]
*  Like that's how they the rockets used to look. Yeah, and I used to enjoy how much I hated it [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4902.3s)]
*  Serious i'm like these guys are so and then well we used to have that joke about whoever got the ball over half court got to shoot [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4909.18s)]
*  Exactly exactly, but I didn't feel like they were like that down the stretch last year [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4916.3s)]
*  No, but I think the van vleet dylan brooks numbers that even though when they came out, you know, like oh my god [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4919.74s)]
*  Like what are you paying those guys? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4924.62s)]
*  Yeah, people were making china jokes for dylan brooks after that laker series when he was in memphis [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4926.14s)]
*  They're like or i'm gonna get like 60 80 million bucks. Yeah, so [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4930.06s)]
*  What happened was I think a couple of adults in the room and [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4934.46s)]
*  Jalen i'd see I if i'm a rocket fan. I I love how talented shangoon is [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4939.42s)]
*  But I can't unsee what that stretch was like [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4945.179999999999s)]
*  It's a higher ceiling with how we know basketball is played where you have to have a guy like jalen green and shangoon [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4948.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a little more mixed on can you win four straight rounds with the guy you're running an offense through and i'm starting to worry about you barry like not [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4955.099999999999s)]
*  showing enough of the high end stuff where ball handling was a question for him coming out of auburn and [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4962.7s)]
*  You know, he just doesn't really get there's a lot of like during the bad jalen stuff [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4969.34s)]
*  Can you guys [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4972.94s)]
*  Find him once in the corner [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4974.139999999999s)]
*  And it didn't seem like they wanted to so I I can't wait for the reid shepard dynamic of all of this this shepard [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4976.54s)]
*  Because it was a team that did not shoot the ball well last year. They were 23rd on from three [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4981.179999999999s)]
*  House they actually were better offensively than maybe you'd think 20th [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4987.259999999999s)]
*  But the thing is this is a young team that played really good defense [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4990.86s)]
*  So can you live with van vleet shepard at the same time? I like I don't know it's endless. It's worth it [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4994.379999999999s)]
*  I don't know. It's endless. It's worth it. Is this your number one league pass team house? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=4999.9s)]
*  They're super high up there. Definitely just just because if shepard is like really if shepard's like mark price in the early 90s [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5004.219999999999s)]
*  This might be the number one league pass team for me super fun [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5010.46s)]
*  If he's just coming off the bench and just lighting dudes up [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5013.259999999999s)]
*  I can't wait. I can't wait either. This is the this is the I can't wait team [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5017.42s)]
*  We all have to go over on this thing. I mean 42 and a half. Yeah [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5021.82s)]
*  Come on [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5025.34s)]
*  The fact that they have the same over under as the lakers is hilarious [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5026.46s)]
*  Hey, it's honestly hilarious. They have so much more talent than the lakers [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5030.86s)]
*  um [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5035.58s)]
*  Bill like [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5038.38s)]
*  Right. No, I know. I know west teams. You'd want to be next five years [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5040.0599999999995s)]
*  Will we all agree? Okay, so he's first [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5045.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5047.099999999999s)]
*  Is san antonio second? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5048.0599999999995s)]
*  Um [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5050.780000000001s)]
*  Because you get wemby. I know that's I I only can see well i'll give you six teams okc san antonio minnesota houston [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5052.3s)]
*  Denver dallas, i have minnesota second because that's how much I believe in edwards [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5060.14s)]
*  I have minnesota second for the same reason over wemby. Yeah [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5064.06s)]
*  Because the team is san antonio second the team is already there [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5067.9800000000005s)]
*  That kid's gonna get a bunch of runs to the nba finals because they have so many picks to play with too with him [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5070.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and minnesota kind of minnesota like this is the team [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5076.54s)]
*  Yeah, but I think houston [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5080.14s)]
*  Is probably four over denver dallas just because way over dallas, you know way over dallas [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5082.620000000001s)]
*  Okay, see, but here's where I have but that's where you have you have yokage and luca [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5089.02s)]
*  um, I would have dallas [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5093.740000000001s)]
*  Higher than houston because you guys you know, you're already are getting somebody who's gonna go down. That's pretty good [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5096.780000000001s)]
*  It's pretty good. You're right. The whole point of houston is you're hoping one of these guys is it with luca with this star [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5101.5s)]
*  You have to put denver down as you mentioned the first five years of lucas start once you put that in perspective [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5105.9s)]
*  And yeah, the other seven guys are you gonna unbuckle those? Why would you have denver over houston? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5109.82s)]
*  Denver is going nowhere. I love yokage. Denver is a dead man walking. Can people stop pretending yokage is gonna quit in two years [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5114.0599999999995s)]
*  I like it because I hate this no i'm doing it because I want to do it twice already [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5121.179999999999s)]
*  I want him to get mad at him be like no i'm actually gonna play until i'm 40 in america [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5125.179999999999s)]
*  You know like a guy has a fucking interest god forbid [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5129.82s)]
*  It's like in the sopranos when tony got the horse [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5136.379999999999s)]
*  That's yokage. He just likes going to the he likes going to the barn. Yeah, but it's like when when chris wanted to write screenplays [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5139.9s)]
*  Yeah, tony was like [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5145.58s)]
*  And then he invests in cleaver right? So it's like what the fuck man stay consistent. I feel like cleaver was a good idea [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5147.82s)]
*  How's that? I watched some sopranos last night [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5154.0599999999995s)]
*  Loved it. Yeah, very guess what? Guess what always delivers the sopranos [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5156.62s)]
*  It's always it's always good. Although if you binge it too hard [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5160.7s)]
*  You can start being like am I in a bad mood right? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5163.900000000001s)]
*  It's like those hospital shows are like that too the doc is so it's been grazed anatomy the doc was really good [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5168.46s)]
*  Yeah, it was really well done. Well executed three overs for houston [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5173.66s)]
*  San Antonio spurs [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5179.82s)]
*  35 and a half. I this is the most everybody was going to take the over no matter what so they just said screw it [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5182.52s)]
*  We're putting this number as high they're just daring you [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5188.46s)]
*  It was like daring last week in the eagles game [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5190.78s)]
*  the eagles ended up they were favored by nine and a half over the browns because [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5194.06s)]
*  People like fandel were like you don't want to take deshaun watson. We're just going to keep raising the line [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5199.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I bet if we put it at nine you still don't want to take the shaun watson and people are like [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5203.74s)]
*  I don't take the shaun watson. You're right [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5208.7s)]
*  Um this line they're like you love wemby [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5210.94s)]
*  Take like they have on the fandel thing. They have a wemby specials [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5213.82s)]
*  You just have all these will wemby have a quadruple double will wemby have a 30 20 and 10 [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5216.94s)]
*  So anyway, it's 35 and a half. It's way too fucking high. I I I don't see any scenario where they hit this [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5222.86s)]
*  It's preposterous. It's preposterous preposterous and I don't think they want to hit it [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5229.98s)]
*  He can't he can't play all 82 games and the only way for them. They win 36 games is for him to play 82 games [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5233.66s)]
*  Their starters are going to be wemby sohan [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5240.94s)]
*  harrison barnes, yeah [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5244.139999999999s)]
*  adults in the room den vasel and uh cp3 and then castle coming off the bench with [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5246.54s)]
*  keldon johnson and zack collins and trey jones, so it's at least [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5251.34s)]
*  It's at least looks like an nba nightmare rotation finally. So they they check that box [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5255.02s)]
*  Sohan's not playing point guard this year. He's not going to play point guard and run actions. Um [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5260.62s)]
*  rusella, what's the wemby ceiling for you this year because [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5265.58s)]
*  I I was baby jesus. I was looking at all these props [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5269.58s)]
*  So i'm fandel 24 points per game is minus 390 five plus assists a game is minus 150 [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5274.06s)]
*  12 rebounds a game is minus 230 [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5281.34s)]
*  And for him to be the blocks leader is minus 480 [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5284.06s)]
*  So those are all like they're saying all on the board because I think you have to break this team into pre and post all-star [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5287.18s)]
*  100 which is why I landed at perfect sense could wemby average 24 12 and five and win the blocks title [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5293.1s)]
*  And from we saw the last two months it was 24 12 and five [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5300.700000000001s)]
*  In 22 games after the all-star break exactly what it was 23 and a half points 12 boards five [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5304.54s)]
*  Assist the assist stuff is nuts. I mean he took seven threes a game in the second half hit 33 percent [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5309.42s)]
*  That's going to get better [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5314.38s)]
*  Yeah, the turnover number that I mentioned earlier was scoop [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5315.660000000001s)]
*  But I mean it's four and a half blocks after that and the spurs went 11 and 16 and [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5317.9800000000005s)]
*  I think eventually years from now [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5323.34s)]
*  Maybe it's already now but like I know the defensive player of the year voting that I was arguing for that [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5324.62s)]
*  I knew I was gonna lose [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5330.7s)]
*  Uh, you're like what revolutionary war guy were you like where you're gonna be on the right side of history [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5332.46s)]

*  That might be the best answer I ever come up with [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5341.66s)]
*  Yeah, so you try to tell everyone yeah, my guys just saying um [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5345.0199999999995s)]

*  Look with chris paul just there to throw an entry pass to web and yama for like thank god [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5356.860000000001s)]
*  Can you imagine in practice when chris paul threw him an entry pass and wendy was like what the hell was that? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5362.780000000001s)]
*  I put my hand out and he just sent a bounce pass and it went to where my hand was [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5368.7s)]
*  Did I tell you I ran into chris paul in the vegas in the fountain blue in vegas for summer league? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5372.62s)]
*  Yeah, so it was after I'd had him for the live show. Yeah, I was coming down to the lobby and then he comes up and [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5377.18s)]
*  It was like [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5381.5s)]
*  Just two dudes glowing in it. We talked about officiating for like 20 minutes officiating then wendy [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5383.02s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't even really get to wendy just officiating [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5389.34s)]
*  Yeah, it just it just it was one of those things that they thank god [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5391.74s)]
*  I'd had the live show to kind of like tie it all up together, but he was pumped. He was so pumped like [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5394.78s)]
*  You know, I don't know if a player would ever be like, yeah, they were my only option [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5401.1s)]
*  Right, you know, but he just was so pumped about like I i'm like at the end of my career [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5404.78s)]
*  I'm gonna play with this guy and I think you know, whatever you think about like [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5410.62s)]
*  Paul I bet you win banyama is just like fired up man like this so hand experiment that was ridiculous [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5415.26s)]
*  I don't think keldon johnson is this bad. I think the cell is pretty good. We'll see what they have with castle [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5420.86s)]
*  There's a few other young guys. There's contracts here that aren't that great, but 36 wins. I like castle. Um [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5425.66s)]
*  Sadly, I have to do this. Um, just let house and I talk about this. You don't have to participate [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5433.18s)]
*  House are we sure chris paul has anything left [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5438.46s)]
*  So last year russell sent it out and have a drink last year 58 games 26.4 minutes a game [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5441.34s)]
*  9.2 points 6.8 assists [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5449.32s)]
*  He's gonna be he's 39 he turns 40 in may [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5453.5s)]
*  Here's the list of 39 year olds guards who have averaged four assists a game [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5458.0599999999995s)]
*  John stockton [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5463.66s)]
*  Nobody else in fact [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5466.22s)]
*  only 11 players [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5468.78s)]
*  Total have been 39 year old guards in the mba like he's not not only old [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5470.78s)]
*  There's really no historical precedent for this you're talking about [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5476.62s)]
*  End of the year end of the career derrick fisher on okc darryl armstrong jason terry [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5481.0199999999995s)]
*  vince carter on memphis [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5486.46s)]
*  Um, how many games does he have to play? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5489.26s)]
*  How many games does he have to play? Let's look at his assist over under right? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5491.26s)]
*  So I was trying to think like what's the best case worst case scenario for chris paul because I thought he looked [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5495.58s)]
*  Closer to maybe being on the uh end of the line last year [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5501.42s)]
*  sure [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5505.66s)]
*  So what's the comeback year from that is it's 65 games? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5507.34s)]
*  And he averages eight assists a game. He was 8.8 two years ago. I think that's perfect [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5512.14s)]
*  I think that's all that san antonio is asking for and I think he's he can do that [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5516.46s)]
*  I don't think that they're going to be asking putting him in the position [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5521.099999999999s)]
*  Golden state needed him to be good golden state needed needed him. Well, they also compete [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5524.62s)]
*  Because of curry and just the weird team they had they actually needed him to like play defense [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5530.3s)]
*  Yeah, like so now wemby's protecting him. Yeah [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5535.099999999999s)]
*  I like it. I think it's a best case scenario. There's really no statistical evidence other than john stockton that [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5538.139999999999s)]
*  Any 39 year old point guard can play 30 minutes a game and [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5544.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know that they're gonna ask him to do that. I can't imagine popovich would ask him to do that [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5547.5s)]
*  I just think a nice entry pass a couple times a night is going to be an awesome thing. It's fair [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5551.339999999999s)]
*  i'm gonna read you uh [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5557.0199999999995s)]

*  24 wins for patrick ewing in year two [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5585.02s)]
*  So if you're making the case for the over there's a hey look at all the greatest big men ever [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5588.22s)]
*  Those guys were actually fucking awesome in year two, but that you know, they were all their different situations [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5593.74s)]
*  Those teams were those are pretty creamless had been four years in college. Yeah. Yeah, ralph samson year two [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5597.9800000000005s)]
*  They were in the playoffs at least but um [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5603.58s)]
*  The picks are what's really fascinating with this team. They have atlanta's unprotected first this year [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5607.02s)]
*  They have a swap with them and that's what's crazy too the murray like bill come to do now for atlanta. Yeah [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5611.82s)]

*  They have a boston swap. They have a dallas swap [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5623.74s)]
*  They have two minnesota swaps and they get a minnesota pick. Sorry one minnesota one swap. They have a sacramento swap [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5626.06s)]
*  So and they have all their first so when they decide [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5633.02s)]
*  Yo [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5636.860000000001s)]
*  This guy would look great with wemby. Who are we saying last night would have been unbelievable with wemby [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5638.22s)]

*  We were saying theoretically I didn't we were saying [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5655.18s)]
*  Theoretically the guy we were watching in some random terrible exhibition game [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5658.78s)]
*  Yes, the stuff ben simmons was doing the brooklyn nets against the washington wizards house made the point [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5662.7s)]
*  If you took this person and he could reliably do this over and over again [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5668.78s)]
*  This is a very good teammate for victor womenyama. He's like a second round top 45 protected swap [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsU2nWa5_-o&t=5672.379999999999s)]
