# Why Doc Rivers Decided to Coach Again #shorts #billsimmons #docrivers #bucksbasketball #nba
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs)
*  Been trying to figure out why Doc Rivers decided to coach again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=0.0s)]
*  He was super happy. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  He loved not coaching. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  He loved doing the media stuff. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=4.88s)]
*  What changed? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  And I have not talked to him. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=7.44s)]
*  This is a guess. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=8.48s)]
*  Philly starts playing really well. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=9.32s)]
*  Everyone starts talking about MB, the new offense. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=10.76s)]
*  The under the radar piece of it is, ah, new coach, Nick Nurse. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=13.96s)]
*  Damn, James Harden goes to the Clippers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And he's playing great. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=19.72s)]
*  Doc's sitting there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=20.8s)]
*  Super competitive dude. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=21.88s)]
*  Hasn't won a final since 2008. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=23.32s)]
*  Milwaukee fires their coach. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=26.32s)]
*  They come to Doc. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=27.92s)]
*  Come home. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=28.76s)]
*  You went to Marquette. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=29.64s)]
*  This will be great. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  Giannis. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=31.28s)]
*  Damn. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=32.08s)]
*  A functional situation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=32.72s)]
*  Philly. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=34.36s)]
*  Dysfunctional. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=35.0s)]
*  James Harden. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  Ben Simmons. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=36.44s)]
*  Clippers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=37.32s)]
*  Dysfunctional. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=37.84s)]
*  Chris Paul and Blake Griffin couldn't stay in each other. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=38.56s)]
*  End of the Celtics run. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=40.52s)]
*  Dysfunctional. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=41.84s)]
*  Rondo. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=42.68s)]
*  Ray Allen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Weird shit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=43.72s)]
*  Come. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=44.32s)]
*  Help us win. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=44.800000000000004s)]
*  You said on the Bill Simmons podcast, Giannis and Dave [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=45.64s)]
*  should be running more pick and roll. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Knock yourself out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  Take us home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=50.64s)]
*  And then he thinks to himself, revenge time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=51.56s)]
*  And I think he takes the job because people are fucking competitive. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=53.92s)]
*  Doc Rivers is still competitive. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=57.6s)]
*  That's my theory. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCZRh9wBATs&t=59.08s)]
