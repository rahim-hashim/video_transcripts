# Doc Rivers on the Celtics Going 3-0, Coaching the Bucks, and Jerry West | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38YRaUdyI4s)
*  Just went to game three of Celtics
*  Mavericks finals, which we're gonna talk about in a second, but what's upon a time? I had an occasional podcast partner
*  It would come on and we would talk basketball and I really look forward to it and I had a great time
*  And I thought we really had something special and then one day I see the bottom ticker of ESPN
*  And my podcast partner who had told me at dinner just a couple weeks before with Larry David as a witness
*  How you didn't miss coaching this is the most relaxed you've ever been you can't believe you had to take a year off and
*  Then all of a sudden in a couple days you were the Milwaukee Bucks head coach and your explanation was I have a chance to coach
*  Yannis
*  That was really it
*  It was so funny because we did we had dinner great dinner
*  Everybody was relaxed. I was very relaxed at the time and then the Bucks opportunity came up
*  And I took it. It was just such a good opportunity
*  That only Yannis with Dame and Chris Middleton a team that had won it already
*  Yeah, things change quickly
*  well and the case I made and we hadn't we didn't really have a long conversation about it, but
*  You know, I was hurt. I was trying to put the pieces together. But ultimately you've been competing your whole life
*  Right since I don't know when you started playing basketball
*  But then you played forever then you coach forever and it's just this switch you you just couldn't flick it off
*  You have to compete, you know, it's true bill, but I would say this
*  I was not going to just take any job that I told you guys that that night
*  if a coaching job had a just open that I
*  Didn't think it was the right organization or the right people the right guys to coach
*  An opportunity to win or at least bill winning I was out
*  And if that job had never surfaced again, I was not gonna take a job I was literally sitting there
*  I was getting better at golf finally
*  I'll believe it on the pod. Yeah, we do have to talk about that because I heard
*  Right when I left there's a guy named Larry David who made a comment that he's gonna lose money now
*  Is that true? I think that is true
*  Oh my goodness
*  I'm gonna let him live with that. I'm gonna like to just what was it like to just walk into a season without a training camp and
*  Without a summer and without any knowledge of the team you're coaching and you're basically just coach for hire
*  Coming in trying to figure out your team the players all the coaches you have you're in a new city
*  You're living in a hotel room. Like what were the what were the first like three four weeks like it was hard
*  Bill way harder honestly than I thought, you know, I coached for over 20 years
*  I thought I can just jump right back into it and and get things going and that just wasn't the case
*  First of all, we were gonna go on our toughest road trip of the season
*  Right right out of the gate
*  I think the biggest thing that I would say
*  For anyone who has done this is that you don't have your staff
*  And I found that to be very difficult starting out
*  And and all the guys that I had were fine coaches. They were good. They just wasn't mine
*  They were I wasn't used to inherited right I inherited two staffs
*  But oh staff and then Adrian's new staff because they they kind of co-mingled and and so now I'm coming in as a third
*  Person, you know that was difficult trying to figure out who I would use in different spots
*  Defensively offensively all that was hard and then we had all the injuries but it did it took a while
*  But I will say this by the end of it. I felt like man. This is gonna be a great job
*  You know, obviously with Yon is out and and Dame injured and Chris playing at probably 90% with his health
*  You knew you wasn't gonna go far in the playoffs
*  I did feel like if somehow we could sneak this first round out without Yon is
*  With Dame getting healthy, but not healthy if we can get to the second round and Yonis comes back
*  I thought we could we could make a run
*  But that never happened
*  So the Yonis injury that I mean we've seen that injury a couple times where they're
*  Little cagey about how long it's gonna be but if you if you just google the injury you're like
*  Oh, that's a month and a half injury
*  So, you know, you know at least it's three four weeks, right?
*  And of course that takes you through the first round so, you know, you're going to the first round without Yonis basically
*  Yeah, I knew I know if anybody can come back would probably be him
*  But I never thought that he would make it back for the first round. I was hoping
*  There was there's whispers that maybe game seven. I don't think that would have happened and truth be told
*  Because after the playoffs were over and watching them work out. I don't think he would have made it back for the Knicks series
*  Until probably game three or four
*  But you know, that's how playoffs are you you have to have health
*  You have to have a lot of things to go for you go your way and we just didn't have that
*  Does the KD what happened him in?
*  2019 hang over the heads of a situation like that. It has to right it really does I was surprised by that
*  Because it wasn't in the Achilles but it looked like one
*  Just like I was actually at the KD game. Yeah, it was close
*  No, no, no, no the Rockets. Yeah, it's the Rockets and Austin was playing for the Rockets
*  I think that was the first time or maybe the second time in my
*  Life that I got to see Austin play a live game that I wasn't coaching him
*  And I remember sitting in the stands and right when it happened
*  You know as you did and everyone did we thought oh wow, he just towards Achilles
*  Yeah, you know now with Yanis, I didn't know but I can tell you forget the KD flashback
*  For me, it was a KG flashback
*  Utah because Utah I remember sitting next to Eddie Lacerte and
*  KG was running down the floor all by himself and he just stopped and went to the floor
*  And I remember Eddie Lacerte turned to me and said this is bad
*  Because no one's around like that's the bad injuries in our league if you run in the collision injuries rarely happen
*  It's when you're running by yourself and your body decides. I've had it
*  With something and so honestly when that happened, that was the first thing that I thought about was Kevin Garnett
*  And something like Yanis, he seems so indestructible. You just assume it's like a LeBron thing
*  It's shocking when he even tweaks anything
*  How are you even hurt you're superhuman so when to watch him go down you go
*  Oh boy, this has to be bad to have him be hurt. No doubt especially knowing that he doesn't like to sit in practice
*  He doesn't like to sit in games
*  You know, fortunately, we were up by like 40 against your Celtics that night
*  If I remember right
*  But even that game got closed after Yanis went out they made a run
*  What was the most surprising thing just being with him day to day for two months that you weren't expecting
*  I've seen coached against him. You had a pretty good feel for him. But was there anything you learned?
*  From the day to day. He's a much better playmaker
*  And I thought you know the energy and the athleticism some of the things he does
*  Bill you can watch him every day for the rest of the season
*  He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy
*  And the athleticism some of the things he does
*  Bill you can watch him every day for the rest of your life, but some of the things he does you'll shake your head
*  That's every night, you know
*  Taking off from the elbow one dribble from half court making it to the basket. I mean he does things that no one else can do
*  but
*  Coming in and taking the job
*  I thought one of the things that I had to do was make him a better playmaker
*  See if he can be a facilitator
*  And I was surprised that his vision like he really has good vision
*  And he in a lot of ways was our point guard at times for us
*  And I think that's one of the reasons we miss him so much against the Pacers and then other than that
*  He's our best player, but his vision surprised me
*  It gave me more hope that when we get this right
*  That we can really do some things offensively
*  It was funny talking to you on podcast about Milwaukee before you took that job when you didn't know you were gonna take the job
*  and
*  talking about Yanis and Dame how it's a little harder to mix those guys that maybe people think because
*  ways people can sag off, you know, cuz Yanis isn't a great three-point shooter and just little tricks and
*  Just things you have to do
*  So then you take the job and did you feel like you unlock that at all by the end of the season or no?
*  Yeah, I thought we got really good at a lot of little things with Dame and Yanis
*  You know, I thought first of all, they start connecting and their two-man game was becoming lethal
*  I think it was second or third best in the league and it's still in my opinion hasn't scratched
*  You know, what was the most difficult thing and it took me a little bit to figure it out
*  Dane didn't have the ball in his hands a lot at times and it was hard to visualize like why is this happening?
*  And and the reason is on missus when Yanis gets the ball, he's elite you want him to break out
*  Dame was going backwards half the time to go get the ball. Yanis is gone
*  right and and so
*  Then you okay
*  So on missus Dame doesn't get it unless it's thrown ahead to him or unless it comes to him in the action
*  But he has to be in front of the ball for that to happen and then on makes
*  Yanis broke the ball up some and then Chris bought the ball up some and I started thinking like wait a minute if that happens
*  We're cutting about 80% of the time that Dame is used to having the ball from Portland
*  And you just can't do that
*  And so what we came to by the end on makes Dame brought the ball up the floor 90% of the time on
*  Missus we wanted Yanis to go and so we're getting the best of both worlds and that's to me is where we're headed
*  We really never got a chance to to work on it
*  But I thought that was a huge breakthrough for us and that the Dame situation where he gets traded
*  He leaves his family behind. He's going through a divorce and just seemed like a lot of personal stuff that was
*  Weighing him down. How did you how did you navigate that during the season and try to get his spirits up?
*  That's hard
*  That was really hard two things and you know, it's funny because I was podcasting with you and golfing with Larry
*  I didn't even realize that Dame was traded two or three days before training camp
*  And so Dame was telling me we were at dinner and he said coach I didn't work out all summer
*  It's the first time in my life that I've not worked out. I was so scared of getting injured
*  Working out. Oh because he was a possible trade. Yeah
*  He knew he was gonna get traded so he said, you know, I did some light running
*  I did some shooting with no one in the gym, but I didn't go at all. He said I was I'm out of shape and
*  And and he was honest about it. That's what one of the reasons you love him because he is honest
*  He said this is the worst shape I've ever been in and I and you know when you start camp that way
*  You don't ever get in shape. You never catch up and he felt that way. It's it's funny
*  You know, I start calling them names like like jokingly
*  With them, you know talking about his weight and he's heavy and all summer now, you know, he's I'm working twice a day
*  I'm down that is like he is so proud that he's in great shape right now already
*  Which is amazing. It also tells you you know, and I shared this with him last week. I said it's amazing
*  You're doing two days right now and the Celtics and the Mavs are still playing right?
*  It just tells you how long of a journey it is for you to win the championship
*  There's half the league is back to work
*  For next season and we still have two teams playing
*  It doesn't look like two teams will be playing much longer
*  We have two teams playing
*  yeah, there was a photo the other day a KD and Chet and
*  Another guy all working out getting ready and it is it is crazy. It's so long plus with the Olympics this year and
*  You know, we'll see but I'm sure you're watching the playoffs and we haven't talked at least on the podcast in
*  2024 but you're watching the playoffs and it's just so funky right Denver Denver loses in round two
*  You have the East just kind of loses its marbles Butler gets hurt
*  The Knicks just fall apart one guy by one guy by one guy
*  You lose half your team and beads hurt and then he's healthy
*  But he doesn't still seem and the East just completely falls apart
*  So on the one hand everybody's like well Boston they haven't beaten anybody in their hand
*  You know these blew up, but you're probably watching it going. Holy shit if we just gone by round one
*  Yeah, you know we match up with Boston the best in the conference. Well, we felt that you still have to beat them
*  You know bill they're they're awful good and you got to give them their credit
*  They've been the best team in the NBA the entire season and it's almost like no one wanted to believe it
*  you know, it's everywhere the criticism of Jason Tatum and and a brown and
*  Who's the best player and they're just I tell you first of all, I don't think Joe gets enough credit
*  I've shared that with you before I think he is such a detailed coach. I mean in the game tonight
*  He files up, you know up six
*  With 22 seconds he was trying to file right, you know, those are strategic things that are big
*  but watching
*  How they play?
*  It's just absolutely beautiful how they play basketball right now. They share the ball
*  Everybody accepts their role. They know exactly where each other is that I don't know how many more slot cuts
*  They're gonna get in this series where a guy drives a guy drives from the slot or cuts on the slot
*  It's a layup
*  You drive you find the corner guy. They they're making the right plays
*  Every night and they're they're over themselves
*  That's what I say this to you all the time
*  About it's so hard to win. It is so hard to win a title and you know
*  But when you see it, you also see it's visual to me is like art for me when you watch you watch every single guy
*  That is over themselves. There's no drama. There's no jealousies
*  Everybody is good with their role. Everybody's becoming star in their role. And when you watch Boston, you know
*  Jalen Brown's gonna be the MVP I
*  Guess of the finals through the first three games definitely
*  But you can make a strong case for how they
*  After the second game I would have said he was leading the way
*  Yeah, and he did stuff tonight like defensively
*  I thought the play where he drove and got the kick for the three might have been the biggest play of the game
*  And he just does it over and over white makes a big three, you know
*  When he came down to it and and Dallas made that run
*  the two biggest shots was
*  I think holiday drove kick for three white makes the second three back-to-back BAM
*  The games put away again and it's what they do. They're just a solid well coached team who
*  You know Kevin Garnett made this comment years ago
*  Sometimes you're good enough to win but you can't because you're not ready to win
*  and
*  Boston watching them play right now. They're ready to win. They're just playing that way. I
*  Want to dive into this because I went to the game tonight and I saw the same thing you did
*  So you're talking about when teams get over themselves, which I think is a great way to put it
*  there was a moment in this game I was sitting on the behind the Celtics bench like about ten rows up and
*  They go on that run in the third quarter and I've watched so much of this team over the last seven years
*  But the the one thing they have this year is
*  They'll go on these runs and they know they know it's happening as it's happening, right?
*  There's like a little swagger to them now that I just don't feel like they had another year
*  At the end of the third quarter and then they had to two threes at the start of the fourth quarter up
*  9170 and I was watching the bench and how locked in everybody is and it really reminded me I texted Steve Carr
*  I was like this reminds me of what was happening with you guys two years ago
*  it was somewhere between the fourth and the fifth game of the finals and
*  just the team lot the Warriors locked in and
*  You know these moments in the series where you're like, oh
*  They figured this out. I remember this happened with the 08 Celtics in the Piston series
*  Somewhere between game 5 and game 6 right and somewhere in game 6 was like this is over. They're winning this
*  What happens how does it explain because you coach teams that that's happened
*  What happens when the five guys lock in like that and the bench locks in and everybody's just like holy shit. This is it
*  It's a combination of the whole season and I just funny I had this conversation with our team this year
*  And our staff like each round you get better
*  People who have never been on the journey have no idea how much you improve
*  From round to round as a basketball team and it's not that you're improving as a player
*  You're improving as a team. You start trusting each other more. You start getting less
*  insecure about stuff
*  individual stuff
*  You're no longer concerned but to one thing and that's giving yourself to the team
*  You buy into everything and there's a happy place
*  You know, I really believe this there's a happy place that teams get to and the only way they can get to it is by
*  You know, sometimes it happens in the in the eastern or western finals. You can see oh boy
*  They just hit the button yeah now now you're gonna have to beat them
*  You know what? I mean and and Boston's been there
*  But even in this series you can see like a year ago. They lose the game tonight. I
*  Agree, they lose that game. I actually think they lose it twice
*  I think they lose them the first quarter when it's 19 or 9 and the crowds into it
*  I think they start doing here about threes and all of a sudden they're down 20
*  And then they lose it again in the fourth quarter as the lead slipping away crowds into it. They can't buy a basket anymore
*  Everyone's just jacking up 20 footers and I think they they definitely were lost in 22
*  They definitely were lost that last year and it's the difference
*  And it comes down at the end of the day to trust the two things that happens
*  Your star players trust
*  Everyone on the team including the coaches and then the the role players
*  Trust themselves and they trust the star players and then when that all happens
*  It's almost impossible to beat that team
*  And you see it every year every year happens. It happened to Denver last year. You know every year
*  It's funny. It was beautiful Golden State
*  Their last title because they had won it
*  But then they lost it and then they had to go back on a journey and they had to bring in some of these young
*  Guys Jordan Poole played great for them
*  Right, and they had to wait. It was like yeah Wiggins. It was a retruss and
*  What's better to watch is no Tatum is great to watch and and Browns been great
*  But it's it's awesome to watch their role. They're quite I'm forgetting the backup center tonight
*  Oh, so man, this is a borderline Tillman game 11 minutes good defense on Luca hit a big corner three
*  He was great
*  You know
*  Howser made big shots in the first three for three. Yeah all trust though
*  That's all trust and and the only reason howzer can make that shot is the star players have to make a play and then they
*  Have to trust instead of forcing shots and that's what they do
*  Watching the Celtics play in the first half compared to watching the mass play
*  It was just two different the mouse first time there in a long time
*  First time there with this team and you can see the difference it just takes it takes everything to win and the Celtics are doing
*  it
*  yeah, the South's had 26 assists tonight Dallas had 15 and
*  What they've done to Dallas the whole series is it's hero ball one-on-one stuff
*  Nobody else is involved, you know Kyrie and Luke I think took 55 shots combined tonight
*  and then you felt it in the end Luca fouls out and we'll talk about the sixth foul in a second, but
*  and it becomes like alright, this is gonna be Kyrie show win or lose and as
*  A Celtics fan who's been with this Tate and Brown era now for you know, two-thirds of a decade seven years
*  This game played a lot of the hits where they look great
*  We're up 21 now it's 15 now it's 13 up there's a lid on the basket like this is the exact type of game
*  They've either lost or almost lost 20 times this year, but then there's this Kyrie piece
*  Where Kyrie he comes in as the big brother, right Tatum's first year?
*  And then it doesn't work out the second year and then
*  Alright the last level of the video game now to go up three nothing in the finals
*  You got to beat this dude that you played with and was supposed to be there for it was just weird
*  It was like surreal to watch right? It's like this is how it's gonna end in game three
*  Yeah, but you know still you know, it's funny because Dallas has gotten a lot of criticism
*  Because of their offense right and what it's not their offense is what the Celtics are doing to their offense, you know
*  Yeah, so explain that explain what they're doing because I don't think people fully understand it
*  Yeah, but you have two superstars on boss on the Mavs and
*  They know that they're going to garner help they come into the game knowing that
*  Every team is gonna send two guys. They're always gonna send an extra guy when they get to the basket
*  The Celtics aren't doing that
*  They're staying home. So in a lot of ways the Celtics are getting away
*  regarding Luca for the most part and
*  Kyrie all the time single coverage and even when they beat them off the dribble, they're still not sending help
*  They're saying
*  Beat us over the top make shots over the top. We're gonna get out to all your players
*  And so, you know and it's bad and by the way spend energy doing that
*  Yes, because Luke and Kyrie were dead in the third quarter and then they rallied a little bit
*  But it was they were when you're carrying an offense like that and just over and over again banging bodies like that's and that you know
*  Luca's not in the greatest shape either
*  And so like those shots that Washington was getting against Minnesota they were wide open now
*  There's someone there and you can see I don't know how many times I thought there was a play late
*  That they threw it to Washington into the corner and he should have shot it right away and he drove to the paint
*  Drove it and had nothing and the reason he didn't shoot is because people have been there all night
*  And so, you know, he's you know, we always used to laugh
*  He's seeing people that aren't there and on that when no one was there
*  He should have shot the ball, but that's what happens and give Boston credit their defensive game plan has been fantastic
*  And let's be honest. They have the ability to do it. They have so many good defenders
*  To me as good as Brown has been offensively
*  He's been unbelievable
*  Defensively and and not only on Luca but more on Kari because of his size and his physicality. He's been amazing
*  Yeah, I voted for Brown for all NBA and part of the case was the two-way game and how hard he plays night-to-night
*  Because I think especially in where the league is in 2024
*  And this is one of the things I love about Janice who as you know is a competitive sociopath
*  Who he just literally is incapable of not trying a hundred percent Brown was like that this year
*  I thought Brown set the tone one of the reasons they won as many games as they did
*  I mean, there's 79 and 20 right now, which is you know, how hard that is
*  that's a crazy record and one of the reasons is because
*  that guy he went up a level and
*  You know, we've seen this really the money started to come in in the late 80s when you were in the league and this but the 90s
*  Was when it really came in and we saw guys go a bunch of different directions, right?
*  Yeah, you played against how many talented dudes in the 90s that
*  once they got a contract it went sideways or
*  Something happened or they got hurt and yeah, it's either a contract or
*  you know this this is a different generation where everyone has their own is like image and
*  You know, it's harder to get everyone to buy it
*  There's there's so worried about their brand and
*  And the guys and the guys that do win and they realize their brand is even better
*  But Brown gets three hundred and four million and everybody's like, oh my god, that's so much money
*  He's the most overpaid guy in the league. He got better and I've been saying this on the pod all year
*  He's been better all year. He was the biggest guy in the game tonight on both ends
*  He made the biggest shot of his career with a minute left when they're they're up to they need a basket
*  Dallas is looming you could feel the Kyrie three coming and he hits this
*  18 footers just money that won the game
*  But I think the mental toughness the mental toughness with him compared to two years ago. It's night and day
*  It's night and day and going left right? He made that shot. Yeah
*  You watch him he this summer he worked on his game, you know, everyone said he couldn't go laugh
*  He couldn't do these he's done him. I think the biggest difference watching Brown play for me is
*  Brown has
*  fluctuated energy wise I
*  Think or or focus wise I think I think he's matured
*  I think he's he's turned into you know, as we say a grown-ass man
*  And he comes into every game with that that mindset
*  And I think a lot of it is work on the court
*  But a lot of it is it's who he is mentally and where he's at and that he's grown up and you can see it
*  Remember when this happened to Paul?
*  When that year the Indiana loss when he took his we he wore the thing on his head
*  He was so bad and also he's in trade rumors
*  But then he came back that next year and he was awesome and the team sucked
*  But he was awesome. And that was the first year. He put together a really professional start to finish
*  awesome two-way
*  veteran leader year and then that led to oh wait when
*  You know, he did it the whole year with KG and rain everybody bill to this day
*  I tell people the reason we wanted in oh eight is because a balls second year with me
*  You remember we butt heads a lot
*  Because you know we had Paul. I just heard him telling this on some podcasts. We had this big falling out of my office
*  and
*  He was pissed because I asked him a question that he thought was why would you ask me this question?
*  I asked him could he shoot I said are you a good shooter and you know Paul, you know Paul Paul
*  Paul has confidence and I remember him saying
*  What kind of question is that? So no, I'm serious. Do you think you're a good shooter? And he says I'm a great shooter
*  You know, what are you talking about? I said when you're shooting 40% I
*  Said so Paul either you're a shitty shooter or you're taking crappy shots
*  Right. You're a great shooter who takes shit shots. Yeah, I said it's got to be one of the two
*  You just told me you're a great shooter, but you're shooting 40% and he was like yelling like what are you trying to tell me?
*  I said, I'm trying to tell you take bad shots
*  And if you want to be a winner, you have to move the ball
*  We'll get the ball back to you and the defense is now shifted and you'll score easy
*  And I've told this hundred times he came back in my office after butting heads the whole year and said we're good
*  Now I didn't know what that meant. I think I thought I knew I thought he was gonna try it the way
*  Did I wanted to and he did it in that following year? I mean if you go look at his percentages, they skyrocketed
*  The problem is we sucked
*  Right, you should have been an all-mba guy that year and the team was too bad. Yeah, he was great
*  It made it easy though, so when Kevin and Ray joined it was easy for him he had already done that
*  Yeah, so it's the same thing he grew up
*  Well that and the reason I wanted to talk about Paul verse Jalen was Paul in that playoffs goes head-to-head with Lebron
*  It's a younger version of Lebron, but it was still Lebron. He was in the league for five years
*  Beats him in a game seven outplays him and then in the finals
*  Let's be honest he kind of outplayed Kobe like he like for real it was at least played him to a draw
*  but the thing that was cool about it was
*  He really thought he was as good as Kobe whether that's true or not. We could bait it
*  I think we know the answer
*  But he thought he was this good and that's what I that's what I'm seeing with Jalen in this finals
*  Lucas better than him, but Jalen doesn't think that
*  Jalen really thinks it's like me and Tatum are on this dude's level and is carrying himself that way
*  The thing that has made Jaden Jalen great is two things number one
*  He thinks he's better than
*  everybody right and
*  But he also knows he's on a team with another great player and and it's not a competition
*  Yeah, it's not a competition for them. I think it used to be
*  But it isn't anymore and again, I keep going back to the maturity thing and and they're competitive
*  And that's the point I meant with Jalen just watching how competitive he is now. He doesn't back down to anyone
*  And I do think and white I think Horford I think drew they all help him. They all help each other
*  But man, they are connected basketball team. And if you're gonna win you have to be connected
*  Does Jalen remind you of Paul?
*  He does
*  You know same size can get his shot wherever he wants, you know guard different types of players can guard smaller players bigger players
*  He's kind of stronger than you think better defender than Paul and Paul was probably a better offensive player
*  In some ways were where Paul was special and all the great ones the Kobe's at the end of the game
*  They could tell you they could tell their opponent
*  Where they're gonna get the shot at and where they're gonna shoot it from
*  Paul of anybody I coach knew his spots
*  Yeah, and he felt like if he can get to it, there was nothing defensively you're gonna do to stop him
*  Unless he just missed the shot
*  And that's what made Paul so good. Well, you know, it's funny then you coach the ultimate example of all time of that Chris Paul
*  Who shot the same jumper from the same shot?
*  Two inches over from the right side of the foul line over and over again and nobody ever realized he was shooting it from there
*  thousand times going right
*  Yeah, but you know, it's funny as a coach. I do remember as a player Mike Rotello, you know
*  Against the Milwaukee Bucks John Lucas went left left left left left beat me left three times and you know
*  He calls a timeout. He's like screaming at me basically said you have another game like this
*  You'll be out of the league
*  Yelling at me and I'm thinking of a man. I swear to God. I'm trying to keep him from going left
*  He's good at it, you know
*  And by the end of my career and I was never on that level of these great players
*  But I remember a young player walking up to me before the game and said hey doc, you're not going right tonight
*  And I told him well, I'm not going left
*  Something's gonna happen but you great players
*  They're gonna get to their spot they just are they're just that good at well one of the things you'd every night
*  Yeah, one of the things that was amazing this whole series, but especially tonight cuz Kyrie
*  He sucked in the first two games and it was a lot of hero ball stuff and he didn't get his teammates involved
*  That's about as bad. I think the crowd got to him. There's no question the game tonight
*  You could see he had a hop in a step. He was making threes and at some point
*  Especially in the second half holiday was like, alright, I got I got him
*  Yes, and they started whatever holiday was doing and then Kyrie responded to it. It was like watching those
*  boxing matches where it's like the the lightweights or like this, you know that that like those
*  125 pounders when it where they're just they're moving at a speed where you can't even keep track and it just seemed faster than
*  Everyone else in the court, but it was great to watch and the reality is
*  It was a great moment for Kyrie and and they made him take hero ball shots and he couldn't he couldn't make the plays
*  Yeah, and I you know, it's funny. I don't know if Kyrie sucked in the first two games or their defense made him struggle
*  Yeah, or maybe no. Yeah, and I think it's a little bit of both. I thought the biggest change tonight is you're right
*  I thought holiday instead of picking them over at half court because I thought Dallas did something really good tonight
*  They took the ball out and they got the ball up the floor quick
*  And so Boston never got into their full court pressure
*  Right, but then if you go watch the last six minutes think about it
*  One of the biggest files of the game was they try to set a pick on
*  holiday at half court because he was up pressuring the ball again and that's what affects them and I thought he started doing it late and
*  You know think about if you're Kyrie Lucas out of the game
*  I got holiday picking me up full court
*  Once I get it across then I have to make the play and I have no other offensive
*  Creator on the floor with me. No one else that can create a shot for him
*  So yeah, he was he was he was against a lot the last five minutes
*  You took over that Bucks job and they had traded drew what six months before
*  Was there still a shadow with drew it all when you took the team over?
*  Because I mean he was one of the most beloved Bucks of all time. Yeah, it was funny. It was more
*  Not that they wanted them back. They loved Damon all that but he was their leader
*  You know, he was he led by example and by what he did
*  and
*  You don't just replace that that takes a little bit of time and and and think also again. They did this trade late
*  Yeah, no, so it had everybody probably in a shock a little bit
*  But you heard his name
*  like
*  It's funny. I've always been a big holiday. I've always liked him a lot
*  I thought he he really took care of Austin his fresh his rookie year in New Orleans
*  You know, he was Austin's rook and and Austin always, you know, I mean Austin being the first person
*  We were talking about players and I remember Austin's rookie year after his rookie year was sitting there having dinner
*  You see you know what the most underrated player in the NBA is and I said who he said drew holiday
*  I said what what are you talking about? He said that this guy defensively
*  There's nobody in the league that can do the things that he can do
*  Well, then when you get to Milwaukee and you coach and you hear you just hear stories about him that on the floor
*  Just as a person
*  And you think man now you got to put this guy on another level
*  You like him even more. They just don't make a lot of people like that and you know
*  Like he's like a champion
*  And so it's really cool, you know
*  It looks like he's gonna get another one and it's because of not just his play but who he is
*  Yeah, there's a confidence with him
*  Yes that
*  when you've won
*  When you've won on the biggest stage and he had one of the great sequences probably in the history of the finals when he's
*  Strip Booker and then throws the that crazy alley of Tiana's
*  It's like you're kind of minted after that but you could feel it in the first two Boston games because there was a couple moments
*  Tatum wasn't playing one game one that game was never really in doubt but in game two there's a couple moments when
*  You know previous Celtics teams
*  I think I don't know if they would have folded but they could have had a little patch where all of a sudden they're down eight and
*  He was I thought that alpha on the court
*  Which I hadn't gone to a playoff game yet until this series with them
*  But I was surprised by that because he's everyone says he's a quiet guy quiet leader
*  But there's an intensity to him. They can kind of feel right he reminds you of
*  Maurice Cheeks in that way. Yeah, that's a good one
*  Yeah
*  I mean Maurice Cheeks would scores eight points in the game and they would be the most meaningful eight points
*  Yeah
*  He makes a run and he would push it up and take that quick pull-up jump shot
*  And then he'd go back to doing his other stuff and then they need and then he'd do it again
*  Drew does it more, you know, he's that plus a better score
*  He does it more and that's what makes him so good, you know
*  It's it's amazing watching all the little things that he does their team does, you know, they're fun to watch
*  I hate to say it because you know, I'm the coach of the Milwaukee
*  Your conference, right? Yeah, but they are a fun team to watch. All right, so Boston's up
*  9170 and
*  Everyone on Dallas is disconnected the body language is awful
*  Nobody's talking as you know, I'm the body language and one of the premier body language experts of all time Celtics body language
*  A-plus Dallas body language Lucas standing in the corner Kyrie's over there and I'm like, oh man, we broke him
*  We broke them this happened
*  Then couple miss shots Dallas makes a couple all of a sudden. It's coming back
*  Luca
*  Picks up I think a fourth foul at some point you stupid foul on Pritchard
*  Just like a hand check foul
*  It's like the kind of foul when you're the best player on the team and then the game you can't have then he gets a fifth foul
*  And then all of a sudden six foul when they're really coming back. It's
*  9390 412 left
*  Jalen drives it to him
*  They call the foul now kid has to challenge right you have to but he's moving they can't reverse it
*  Were you shocked by that call this is the best guy in the game I
*  Didn't like the call
*  In general because I didn't you know, I just didn't like to call but if you're gonna blow the whistle on that
*  It was the right call, right? Absolutely was a foul. You know, it's funny. You know, I was watching the game over Larry's house
*  Yeah, and Luca picks up his fourth foul and Larry will tell you I turned to him and said
*  Lucas gonna file out in this game. He's not gonna make it through this game
*  He's not gonna make it through this game. He's really emotional
*  There was a you just you you read it. You just didn't like there's something you noticed and then like
*  Yeah, I told Larry sitting right there. I said Lucas gonna file out in this game. I said he's really emotional
*  There was a play and he got fouled on that drive
*  You know toward the basket and I think it was Tatum forearms him falls out of bounds
*  Right lost it that was a clear file that to me that call literally has to be made
*  They didn't make it. They just you know, they didn't make the call and and so from that point on
*  Luca those files came right after that. He just
*  He snapped, you know in some ways and you know, I wouldn't say snap, but he just I don't mean he just got lathered up
*  He started playing angry you start playing angry
*  He start playing fiscal and he started does this thing sometimes and all the great players do it. They start daring the ref
*  Yeah
*  No, you didn't call that make this call and so they said okay
*  We'll blow the whistle we will and listen you you have Cape as a rep and market
*  Those aren't the guys you want to mess with right, you know
*  Larry was laughing because I told him I said Lucas messing with the wrong group tonight
*  This this is not gonna go well for
*  And it didn't you know
*  So it was we're laughing because Larry was laughing said you just said that I said you could see it happening
*  You can literally see it happening. Well, they I mean they were letting everything go
*  It was a super physical game and I thought one of the reasons Dallas came back was cuz kids
*  You know, he's one of the best 50 players ever. He's been in games like that. And I think he told his team like
*  Ramp it up man. They're not calling anything because their defense got so physical in the fourth quarter, but it was working
*  I mean it was one of the reasons Boston's offense. I know people they see it and they're like all Boston's choking
*  Dallas was a this game turned into a rugby match and Dallas kind of realized it before Boston did and that was one of the reasons
*  They came back. I thought that was a reason and Boston did something that you do. That's another reason. It's so hard
*  They thought about winning a title for about five or six minutes
*  Yeah, that they started thinking about oh my god, we could close this on Friday. Yeah, they you could feel it
*  They start slowing the ball down
*  They were they were milking the clock you can see it and they had a momentary lapse
*  of thinking about
*  What's ahead instead of staying locked in and then all of a sudden they got locked back in and they win the game
*  I think it'll allow them to close out now because they've already had their their scare
*  You know Dallas is gonna have to play
*  Unbelievable to win this next game or it's gonna be a sweep and the thing we're not talking about with Boston
*  They've not lost the road game in the playoffs. This is an historic
*  run if they if they win
*  The next game they've only lost two games in the entire playoffs and they went undefeated on the road
*  There's 34 there's I think 34 and 14 on the road just period this season
*  Yeah, this was a and I told you this so, you know, I'm not lying
*  Everyone, you know, everyone asked me before we game what's gonna happen?
*  What do you think and once KP got scratched which we haven't even talked about and I think people just assumed Dallas came three their home
*  They're gonna win and I was like I
*  Was telling everybody I think this office are gonna win tonight
*  Because they haven't made threes yet and for whatever reason I can't explain it
*  But they play better on the road and I don't really fully understand especially Tatum. I think he plays I
*  Think home and I've asked people with the Celtics about this like why is Tatum better on the road than home?
*  What are the reasons and there's a bunch of it right when you're home you're dealing with
*  Tickets for everybody, you know, you're with your family
*  The choir with you though. Yeah, but you see you play better at home
*  The only place that I thought it was difficult to play at home was in Philly because of the crowd and I thought it affected our
*  Player sub but that's I think this is the Tatum piece though
*  I think people have been watching him for so long when it's not going well for him
*  You can hear this weird murmur in the crowd. Yeah, and it's just that energy is a little weird and once that happens
*  It's hard to get it out of your brain when you're a player, but they are awful good on the road
*  It's amazing how comfortable they are and the other thing their role players play well on the road
*  Which you know, you know, they hit threes on the road
*  They were 17 for 46 and that was one of the things I was telling people I was like watch our threes for over 15
*  That's that's where they need to be and I'm by the way, I think they're gonna be over 15
*  I think they're finally gonna hit some of these so, you know, they just played free and loose
*  Jalen Brown use a
*  Term that I've never heard. I loved it
*  He talked about their bench and then they call them stay ready players and I've never heard that before and I was like
*  Oh, I love that. I'm using that I'm stealing that the state readies
*  Yeah, he said the stay readies were all great tonight
*  And that says a lot about that that team has had a lot of talk to each other about hey one might
*  You may play 15 minutes one day you may play none you just have to stay ready and they've all bought into it and you
*  Can feel it. That's another thing we talked about made teams connected teams. They put they've become that well
*  And that's the thing when Kate so KP that injury that I don't I can't even explain what it was
*  Like this it's part of the body nobody ever heard of and they're saying like the 30 people in America have had this injury
*  This year, it's like, okay
*  But then he gets scratched have you been in a situation like that where
*  One of your best players is like, alright, he's out. He's 50 50 my play my play. No, he's actually not playing but with this team
*  I was like, I don't know. I think they might be okay
*  That I think they're so deep. Yeah, I mean they really are your replacement is Horford
*  It's a Richard minutes and a little film and tillman was awesome tonight
*  Tillman was unbelievable and and this is where from a coaching standpoint
*  You're so happy for any guy that has gone through the journeys that the Tillmans have gone through, you know
*  when when the Bucks wanted, you know, obviously everybody was happy for Yanis and and and but you're really happy for the
*  Brook Lopez is the Pat Conantons of the world. Yeah same thing
*  that's what a coach looks at is all the other guys that have to put in the same amount of work and
*  Sometimes even more work than the great player and and and they get to shine and it's really cool to watch
*  One of your closest friends on the planet is Sam Cassell. Yeah who you've sat next to a lot
*  Who was on the OA team?
*  He was at the tail end of his career but got a ring
*  But then you went through a lot of wars with him and he's on this self-expensed
*  What is it? What does he tell you about the team that you could?
*  Talk about on a podcast about portraying him the closeness
*  he says a couple things that
*  drove Joe holds everybody accountable and
*  Everybody allows him to hold him accountable, you know, he said something last week
*  He said I remember you telling me he was talking to me and they said
*  that
*  Players have to allow their coach to coach
*  They have to they have to get to a place where you know what?
*  I'm just gonna drop my guard down and I'm gonna allow him to I use the word get in there and just
*  Just let him do his thing
*  And then the coach on the other it has to allow the player
*  To do his thing through the team and that's where they're at and he says it's really amazing like
*  He said Joe holds them accountable, you know all the time and they're allowing him to do that
*  And then the second part is he said he says oh he said doc these boys are connected there's there's no
*  The word I always use and they use it now. There's no clutter. There's no clutter on this thing. They're just not there's no clutter
*  There's there's nothing can shake this team and he talks about that all the time
*  When you see the media shit that goes on and look I do three podcasts a week
*  Sometimes there's narratives you want to talk about
*  But I've never the Tatum Brown thing. I'm just I'm all in on those guys. I've never
*  Never really wavered like this is there's something special with these two
*  But then when we get to the playoffs there's something to talk about then it's like who's better Tatum or Brown
*  It's Tatum good enough. It's Tatum elite Tatum's. He's a first-team all-mba guy
*  But is he really that good and how do you navigate that stuff as the coach because you know the guys see it?
*  They're in a hotel room. They're on Twitter. They're getting texts from people
*  How do you keep their heads from not kind of drifting toward this dumb shit? Well as a coach you call it the peripheral opponent
*  Pat Riley used to use that term all the time the peripheral opponent
*  And you know, it's more if your team
*  Is connected and if your team has a goal that is bigger than the individual it doesn't affect the team
*  It really doesn't
*  I'm sure they all see it and they all hear it and the family members bill. Oh
*  Can you believe there? I mean they you're sitting at dinner and I can tell you how it works
*  You're sitting at dinner sometimes with your family and your brother may be sitting there
*  Hey Jason, can you believe they're saying Jalen is better and Jalen is I guarantee you Jason hears it and it's it's white noise now
*  Like but a year ago two years ago they may have gotten a discussion out of it's blue noise. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's so whatever
*  You know, you had this happens when you had this in 2008 Paul won the finals MVP
*  Could have made a really good case for Ray
*  Like a really good cause I actually probably would have voted for Ray
*  it was it was even either way right and
*  I'm sure Ray didn't care because he was so excited to win the title, but that's something in this
*  Yeah, that stuff happens in his current league. I think it's even more so, you know
*  Jalen wins the MVP of the Eastern Finals. There was pure joy from everybody right?
*  And it becomes an ESPN segment anyway where they're like wait, what's was Tatum really happy? It's like wait
*  What he's happily smiling and clapping and you know what we all miss like who's?
*  Every team's best defender on Jason Tatum
*  every night
*  And so we always miss that
*  Sometimes like the reason the other guys can get off because sometimes they don't have the best defender now in Brown's case
*  It doesn't matter who guards him either
*  They're just two great players that plays on the same team that are over themselves and are more concerned about winning
*  Then they are about the individual stuff and that's why they're winning. Yeah, I did something top my podcast a couple days ago about
*  a just a culture of basketball
*  It's like well somebody has to be the best player and that's what happens because when Michael Jordan was in the Bulls
*  He was the best player and pitbull in second and that's just how we think about basketball
*  And yet happened once that you can make a case
*  That the Detroit Pistons with Larry Brown
*  That you couldn't circle who clearly was their best player
*  Yeah, well you'd have to go way back because like the 79 Sonics were like that
*  Yeah, even the 89 Pistons. I say it was their best player even though they had a bunch of stuff, but yeah
*  But oh wait, it's clearly
*  He was the best player you could have made a case for other guys, but KG was the best player no doubt and and so
*  But you need the bet you need separators like you want your best player
*  You want everybody to know you know
*  Perk always laugh. I I swear I don't remember doing this but it was in Milwaukee
*  we had won a game and I must have felt like
*  Rondo per baby all those guys
*  Start thinking that they were part of the big three
*  Okay
*  extended big three
*  I walked in the locker room after a win. So I want to make something clear tonight. We have a big three
*  We don't have a big four. We don't have a big five. You don't have a big six
*  We have a big three and this is who we play through
*  Every single time down the floor and these big three guys will get everybody else shots, but don't get this twisted
*  We have a big three
*  Like Perk says it all the time I swear I don't actually remember doing that buddy
*  Who I was at Rondo's wedding by the way this past weekend, which was amazing
*  It was where the James Harden toss the bouquet toss. Oh that was that video
*  That was that Rondo's wedding so well you think about it 16 years ago since that team won and
*  Does it matter who you think was the best player of the 2008 Celtics? Not really
*  You think anybody like gives a shit and that's the thing like let's say the Celtics win Friday night
*  Jalen Brown wins the MVP and then two days later be like
*  Jason Tate it basically what happened with Steph nine years ago, right when Iguodala won the finals FB. It's like well
*  What does this mean for Steph and his legacy? It's like I guarantee it doesn't care. He just won the title
*  But it didn't matter like you know, it didn't matter to the most with Steph
*  He's a champion that's all that matters
*  Right, and then we had the same thing when he was in the 17 and 18 Warriors
*  When KD was there and it's like, you know
*  He's really happy to win back-to-back titles. I promise he's not not sitting in bed at night going
*  Oh, man, I can't believe I lost the finals MVP. Yeah for my legacy. I need an MVP
*  No, he doesn't and he could have won that year too. Like it's not like he wasn't great in those series
*  He was so yeah, I think that's the stuff that is talked about more outside of teams
*  Then it actually is worried about inside of teams and it is a worry
*  Then that team's not gonna win if it is a worry with that team. That's not the team
*  They're not connected and they're not gonna win anyway
*  Do you see a scenario where Tatum and Brown are just together the whole time like Bird and McHale were?
*  Yes, I do. I think I do too
*  I think because of the salary structures now
*  That they're gonna both, you know Tatum's about to get paid a lot of money
*  315 and so once they sign those deals, they're basically on that team now
*  The only difference is they're both young so they have another both of them have another big contract
*  Coming yeah after this one and that will be the only time that that they would be considered and possibly
*  You separate them but they can live an entire career together
*  Which when you can do that for any team, it's pretty special
*  Well, what that's the most special thing that like that's what as at stake for clay this summer, right?
*  Because I'm sure Philly Orlando somebody's gonna have a ton of money to offer him. But you got to start weighing like
*  You know, it's that's like Jordan Pippen Pippen ended up leaving because Jordan retired
*  But they played Jordans entire most of his entire career and pretty special Bird and McHale same thing
*  But yeah, it's it's a different level when you stick together that long
*  I mean you had it with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Oh wait. No, I guess I guess that's a bad example
*  But that's that's what
*  You think about that? That's one of the reasons it is special when it happens
*  I think about all these two sums three sums. Oh my god
*  This has so much potential and then it just blows up all of a sudden Ben Simmons is in London as your seasons going on
*  You're like what happened? We had this special thing where to go
*  Bill it can go so quick
*  You know, you think I think about all the years that I've coached and and again
*  I'll go back to all the teams that I've coached and and there's times where I think I'm I have my team overachieving
*  At times I thought the Philly team, you know the year before they got swept in the first round by Boston
*  And now we've just won the regular season conference, you know with the same team
*  But it doesn't take much and that's what's so cool when teams win, you know
*  Ben starts struggling with free throws and it became a thing the next thing, you know, he's gone
*  You know, I look at the the Chris Paul game where in Oklahoma City
*  Remember, we're gonna win that series
*  We're up and Chris is the smartest player in NBA one of the top smartest players in NBA history and he had
*  literally two minutes of
*  Mistake basketball. Yeah, and you know, we didn't we didn't foul we
*  Chris tried to throw the ball from half court to draw a foul which you know, those aren't Chris Paul plays and
*  Then we lose that game
*  we lose the next game and we're out and
*  And the team never returned back the same after that
*  well, you know and then you had the Josh Smith Cory Berger game the next year the next year like
*  You know from a coaching standpoint, we're up and all of a sudden and Chris was playing on one leg
*  That's the one thing I always tell people we didn't have home court
*  Yeah, and Chris is playing on one leg and then all of a sudden the guys you want taking shots
*  Start think about that game
*  Kevin McHale had benched
*  Hardin yeah, and he was about to bitch take the white hour now
*  All of a sudden they win the game, you know, it's it's amazing
*  I went to that game Hardin had a towel on his head and he was checked out for the season and I think
*  I think he might have been on Expedia making Vegas flights and then all of a sudden Josh Smith made a couple threes
*  But I mean that basically almost happened tonight
*  Yeah, it was 91 70, you know, I think with the three-point era
*  I never feel safe because I was getting
*  Congratulation texts and I get so mad when people congratulate me, especially with the Celtics team
*  Like don't ever congratulate me during a Celtics game like
*  Yeah, I just get mad I just pretend that I don't get them. All right, this was fun. I had a good time
*  You what happens Friday any guesses or do you know want to make a guess
*  What do you what do you what do you expect from a big picture standpoint like down three? Nothing?
*  Does Dallas shake it up? Do they just play the head shake it up? I think they have to play the way they play
*  This is what got them there. I think Luca and and curry have to be
*  Incredible in this game for them to win
*  But I would not be surprised at all if Boston were to win
*  At all if Boston won four straight
*  Did you buy any like it's game three and kid plays 11 guys in the first half?
*  When you're at this stage of the playoffs in round four
*  You really know who your eight or nine is at this point that told me that he wasn't positive
*  Who he could trust beyond his first couple, right? Yeah, you're searching and that that happens you get down to you know
*  Hardaway hadn't played a lot. So you kind of knew coming in he was gonna play a little bit more
*  You know, they needed their role players to play better but it's and I keep saying this is difficult because
*  Bosses not helping and so their role players aren't getting the shots that they're used to getting and I think it's very difficult for them
*  to play well
*  Yeah, this game for is weird because you think oh, yeah that they're gonna sweep
*  But we've seen situate like in 2017
*  Golden State goes up three nothing with one of the four best basketball teams probably of all time
*  And then they blow game four in Cleveland and they have to go back to go on staying closed
*  So you just never know wait last thing
*  Jerry West
*  Yeah, that's sad. You know, I knew that he was struggling. I saw his wife Karen a couple weeks ago
*  you know, I was able to text with him a couple of times but
*  It really sad but you know, it's sad because we lost
*  Jerry West but then when you just sit back and think about
*  This guy lived a life
*  You know, I remember I had I was at a funeral years ago and a guy was sung about the dash, you know
*  whatever
*  20, you know 1904 to
*  2000 is where he lived and the dash in between he filled his dash up, you know
*  Yeah, he filled the dash up completely, you know through his life
*  You know Jerry was a complicated person because he lived a very dark life, you know growing up and and to beat those odds
*  from West Virginia
*  to become the logo
*  To be as almost as good of a front office guy as you are as a player when you're one of the greatest players ever
*  I mean the dude overachieved everything and of all the people that you know, maybe of anyone I've met
*  His love and competitiveness for the game
*  Was unmatched if you talked to Jerry
*  last week if you could and you start bringing up the Celtic series and
*  He would start crying he would start having literally tears in his eyes
*  Think about how long ago that was and it still affects him that they couldn't break through
*  That just shows you the passion and the love that he had for the game that that he was so great at
*  yeah, I loved researching him and when I was doing my book and
*  He somehow he's one of the 12 best players of all time still
*  But it's somehow underrated because he was so great
*  Year after year after year and had just the worst luck on the planet. Like it's he wins one title, but really could have won five
*  You just could go through and it's like well if that didn't happen if Elgin doesn't get hurt Frank
*  So we shot goes and you just you start banging all those out. But what was really interesting
*  was how the other players revered him and
*  you know in the 69 finals
*  Havlicek goes up to him right after they win and just hugs him and he's like, I love you. I
*  Really want you to win a title someday
*  I feel bad that we won like that's how
*  For a player to reach that kind of level with the other players that they're trying to beat where they're like I feel bad
*  We're beating you. I never heard of that
*  There's very few people like that. And I think the reason was because the way he approached the game
*  Yeah, you know he played the game as pure as you can play it and as hard as you can play it
*  And he had you know, we always talk requirements. He had the required amount of intensity
*  Every single night and it's what what separated. Yeah, I thought even watching the tapes and studying it
*  I he's one of the guys from that era that you actually could have put into any air and I think he's probably just as effective
*  He just sort of figured it out. It's like oh we have the three-point line now
*  I'll become one of the best three-point land chick like he switched positions
*  You know how hard this is he's basically the point guard of the Lakers the last four or five years
*  He was shooting bars. It was but he was bringing the ball up. He led the league in assists
*  You know, he whatever it took he did, you know could have been a great player in this year Kevin Garnett
*  Because Garnett would have been a even been a great three-point shooter
*  We don't know one just took him but I always think man
*  He was almost made for this era and then the last thing I'm gonna say about eras before we get to loss is
*  every old player loves
*  That the game over the second half of the year became physical and scoring dropped
*  It answers every question, you know all the arguments
*  Well, the game was more physical and then you have these guys saying the game is nothing more physical
*  It's we guys would have scored in your know the game's physical and scoring dropped and and it's a better
*  Game to watch right now in my opinion because then that called it all these files
*  they're allowing them to play and the game right now is
*  Really perfectly wrapped in play and I love how they're doing
*  So when you were coaching you you notice this immediately that they flipped the world
*  Oh, I just noticed they wouldn't call them files and you know, the only mistake that the league didn't tell anybody
*  At first usually we get memos. Hey guys, we're gonna stop calling this
*  It was it was like they had a meeting in some dark office. Hey, we're just gonna start letting them play
*  But it didn't take long and then Adam had to come out and say yeah, we're allowing it
*  But it was obvious. I mean think about I I coached the game this year bill
*  against the Boston Celtics
*  That there were two foul shots
*  In the entire game, but you probably loved it
*  I love you know what I love the game was over in under two hours
*  It was amazing. So I actually like I love how the game is being played right now. It's good
*  I like I like what you said about the dash with Jerry West because I think
*  Start to finish lifetime of basketball. He's gotta have that has to be the greatest career anyone had right?
*  He was a top 15 player ever and then was a top five executive ever
*  He
*  His dash is full
*  Completely he lived a life that no one in NBA history has ever lived
*  You know, you won't look at the year that he was born. You shouldn't look at the year
*  He died you should look at the dash in between
*  From college from high school to pros the man lived his life to the fullest and you know, god bless him
*  We're gonna miss him
*  You
