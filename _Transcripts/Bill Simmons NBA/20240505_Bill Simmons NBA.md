# NBA Magic Vs. Cavaliers Game 7 LIVE Playoffs Reaction with Bill Simmons and Ryen Russillo
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q)
*  Okay.
*  uz
*  He really, really, really gives a shit about every game.
*  It's great.
*  I love it.
*  This is a long sustained offensive excellence that when you watch it feels legitimate.
*  We're not going to be nice.
*  What do we care?
*  We're just these let's call it what it is.
*  All right.
*  We are live on YouTube.
*  I wish my voice worked.
*  It is 1252 PM Sunday.
*  Just watch the Cleveland Cavaliers outlast the Orlando Magic.
*  We're taping the first part of the BS podcast right now.
*  Ryan Rosillo is here aka red light Rosillo.
*  We are going to we're going to dedicate this episode to Franz Wagner's trade stock,
*  which took a massive hit today.
*  We're so low, but let's start positive with the Cavs.
*  It got dark there in the second quarter.
*  I was preparing for this pod and I'm just on trade machine making up Mitchell trades.
*  I'm looking at the Cavs salaries.
*  I'm like would they trade Mitchell and Jared Allen is mobile available is Bickerstaff going
*  to get fired at halftime fans are booing.
*  It just seemed bleak and then all of a sudden near the end of the second quarter.
*  It started to flip their down 10 and halftime and then second half took over.
*  Did you think that was it for Cleveland at any point during that game?
*  No, not at all because I just know Orlando's offense, especially on the road and really
*  Palo was keeping alive not so much with the shot making but his free throws.
*  So when it was 49 31, I look no matter who it is, unless it's just a complete mismatch.
*  I feel like even as bad as games get someone's going to make some kind of push and this is
*  why you have a Mitchell who at his best if he had qualified, I probably would have voted
*  on a mall NBA this year and me too.
*  I know he's not perfect.
*  He can just take over games with his aggressiveness and I thought he realized that Laverte finally
*  had a decent game.
*  Strews showed up in the third quarter and you're probably trying to figure out if you
*  could trade Garland at some point too, but it was 49 31 and then from that point on and
*  the final score is different, but it was 99 87 Cleveland in a 12 point deficit for Orlando
*  seems insurmountable with this offense over that time Cleveland outscored him 68 to 38.
*  So yeah, was there a result from this series that was actually going to make you feel
*  drastically different about either one of the roster questions?
*  That's a good question actually because the result I think here was that they didn't
*  have Jared Allen in this game and I just kind of like watching the Cavs more when they
*  have one big guy instead of two, which I felt that way.
*  I felt that way when Moby was out there in the season and Jared Allen was the lone big
*  guy just seems like when they have more space, they're more interesting.
*  Moby, you know, I think he had like five or six turnovers in this game, but there was
*  some rebounding shop blocking stuff he did and shot intimidation stuff that I thought
*  was pretty important.
*  Like I like how he played.
*  He's still a little sloppy still a little clumsy.
*  He's still a little weird around the rim, but and he still feels like a little bit of
*  a work in progress.
*  And when you compare him to people like Edwards and Palo who were just precociously dominating
*  his alphas in these playoff games, he seems like super young compared to them.
*  But yeah, that that was the only result I had was what do they do with Allen?
*  Because if the Celtics waxed them in round two, does that really change that much for
*  them?
*  I think the Mitchell thing Mitchell kind of needed those last couple games here because
*  I was I was looking back.
*  He had 12 playoff games going back from 2022 through game for Orlando where he was 21
*  a game 42% field goal.
*  He had four wins.
*  He was four and eight in those games.
*  Then game five.
*  It felt like he got going.
*  I thought that was an important win for them because I really really said Mike Orlando
*  was going to steal that game game 60 is 50 today.
*  He was awesome.
*  And I feel like he's kind of reestablished himself as the asset that I think deep down
*  we all felt like he was but we hadn't seen it on this stage in a couple of years until
*  this week.
*  I'm pretty sure the league though would look at him and go okay, if he's available and
*  he wants to resign with us like yeah, we'll take him which I think was the
*  debate about the New York decision and the Cleveland decision at the time and we sit
*  around and we we talk about these teams and we critique them for some of the trades and
*  it's like well, what are we supposed to do wait for the first team all NBA guy, you
*  know, we're supposed to wait to be a perfect fit for him.
*  So if Cleveland had been balanced it would have been more disappointing because it's
*  a two years with the Mitchell Garland thing that I still think has questions.
*  You're absolutely right about the Alan Mobley part but to not have Alan as a possibility
*  when he's 17 and 14 in the series isn't a good thing.
*  But it makes it like granted he's not playing so that means Mobley is going to be
*  split with these guys, but it just was going to feel more disappointing if Cleveland
*  lost game seven at home.
*  But we're going to be asking the same stuff if they get smoked by Boston.
*  So whatever whatever you think you were going to ask today if they lost if they don't
*  beat Boston if it's a quick series, we're just going to delay the questions we were
*  asking today and as far as Orlando if they had gotten this one like, okay, Paulo
*  Czech man, Franz like he needs to be a better to option, you know, they need shooting
*  maybe they need playmaking like they were going to need those things even if it was
*  a competitive second round.
*  So sometimes the distance in the playoffs like I think tricks us into talking about
*  teams differently when I was just watching this one.
*  I was like every single concern I've had about either one of these teams is just
*  evident and then some teams going to win it.
*  Yeah, that's a good point.
*  I think the one difference though is if Orlando loses they were playing with House
*  Money.
*  It's a game seven.
*  They had a lot of young guys in this series like Suggs and Franz.
*  I think we're three for 25 at one point and Garland on the other end wasn't playing
*  well either like these game sevens national TV when the crowd gets nervous like it's
*  just a different energy and atmosphere.
*  We both been to game sevens.
*  I've been to a lot of them and it's just feels different from the moment you're in
*  the building.
*  I think where the stakes were higher for Cleveland was the way that second quarter
*  was going when the crowd was booing and it just was like man if they like lose by
*  20 at home in a game seven, what happens to this team?
*  It felt like bicker steps out probably the next day Mitchell trade the trade start
*  immediately and then it's like do we just keep two of Garland Mowby Allen?
*  What do we do?
*  It just it felt like an explosion for about 10 15 minutes there though part of the
*  problem for Orlando is Palo was putting up site.
*  Did you see him at the end when they showed him that close-up?
*  He was like there's different levels of tired.
*  He was I'm going to puke tired like they were showing him.
*  He looked like when I you know that stupid MTV challenge show that I watched
*  when they're pushing the guys too far and they just bend over and start puking and
*  it was like his power just gonna start throwing up on the court like that's how
*  tired he was but he was getting no help.
*  So anyway, I thought it was a really dangerous half hour there for Cleveland that
*  they fought off now if they get swept by Boston all the same questions get asked,
*  but I don't think at the same level of intensity right now because that one clearly
*  they're not expected to win even though I thought the series is going to be pretty
*  close and you're right if Cleveland doesn't get game seven at home with this group
*  for the second year because last year was a disappointment against New York.
*  So yeah, yeah, it means it means more to them the outcome to go ahead and get this
*  win but on the Orlando side of this and you're always bringing this up and there's
*  just constant reminders and I don't know if it's game seven.
*  I don't know if it's being young and the first time through but Franz and Suggs
*  ended up three of 28 in this one.
*  Franz is I didn't know it got worse.
*  I saw the worst 25 Jesus three and 28 three for 28 Franz one of 15 05 from three
*  and you know, I brought this up a couple weeks ago where when we really like Franz
*  it was like where's the hole in his game like the best version of was okay.
*  He can put it on the floor.
*  He's got all the size is a good defender and he can shoot it and when you look at
*  his college stats like even if the scattering report on him was that you didn't have
*  to respect the shot enough.
*  There was still enough of a percentage there where you felt like it was it was going
*  to develop into something on top of his free throw shooting, which is what scouts
*  always look at like, okay, maybe if I don't love the three-point numbers or don't
*  love the way the shot always looks like there's something to work there with and
*  it it became evident.
*  There was just a lot of times in these games where Franz didn't even trust himself.
*  They even brought it up in the broadcast where he said to them, I think it was with
*  Salters or he's like, I know I'm a better shooter than this.
*  It's like what you've got to have to fight through that doubt because then he
*  starts getting a little clunky with it and he's kind of just fine like he's going
*  to the hoop but you could see was just really really struggling with it.
*  So then you go, okay, Suggs isn't making shots.
*  He's not making shots and Palo Suggs wasn't afraid to shoot, which was the
*  difference.
*  Franz had a couple possessions and you could just see it, especially if you've
*  ever played basketball.
*  You can see it in somebody's demeanor.
*  It's like, oh, that guy doesn't want to shoot.
*  Duh, you see all the time these and Cleveland started sagging off him and he
*  was like, oh fuck.
*  I still don't want to shoot.
*  Hey, does anybody want to come over and set a screen for me so I can try to
*  get to the basket?
*  It was pretty brutal.
*  Yeah, so I'm not sure how Orlando could ever win this game.
*  If you're like, hey, this is what the second and third options they're going
*  to shoot three at 28.
*  No, there was a way for them to win though.
*  Rossello.
*  They it was with defense.
*  I think they win a rock fight, which is like if you were going to pick Orlando
*  in this game, the over under I think got to 195.
*  It went up after Jared Allen went out.
*  Orlando was like plus four and then if you're going to pick Orlando, it is
*  like a 78 to 73 final or an 88 to 81.
*  It's one of those type of games, right?
*  The problem for them is Mitchell got going and then strews out of nowhere
*  became Miami strews again for like five minutes and he hit those three threes
*  did 33 points in the third quarter.
*  You know, and that, that was what swung the game, but I think, I think there
*  was a recipe for a lander to win where it was just ugly and Palo was getting
*  to the line over and over again.
*  Mitchell was three for 13 the first half.
*  And it felt like he just couldn't get it going.
*  And then then that meant nobody on Cleveland was going to get it going.
*  But then he got it going.
*  But this is why you pay Mitchell.
*  This is why there'll still be demand for Mitchell because you know, in the
*  gossipy world of the NBA, there's not anyone that I've talked to that thinks
*  that he would actually tell them, Hey, I'm going to sign here.
*  So all of this may be delaying the stuff that we talked about at the beginning.
*  But no, is imperfect as you can argue Mitchell can be, you know, I've talked
*  about like the downside of him being a little peak Westbrook lightish where
*  he'll just go like, I got to do this all on my own.
*  Well, sometimes you need that, especially when there's nothing from Garland.
*  Laverte hadn't been good until this game in Garland.
*  If they lose this one, then it turns into like a bad Garland summer.
*  So, you know, who knows?
*  Although he had a really important stretch there late where he got to
*  steal on sucks after the inbound when the game still felt like it was in play.
*  He then hits a shot, then gets a rebound.
*  So, you know, I'm reaching my peak Garland.
*  He's playing hard.
*  I can make a Garland defense for one for five seconds.
*  I like Garland.
*  So go ahead.
*  I like them a lot.
*  And that broken jaw thing is like not a small thing.
*  If you're a basketball player and you're coming back from like a real
*  injury to your face and you're a guard.
*  And I just think it fucks with their head a little bit.
*  Like I was looking at his stats like two years ago.
*  He was basically 22 and nine before the Mitchell trade.
*  Right.
*  And then it's gone backwards.
*  And now he's like a 17 and six guy, but I'm still.
*  I don't have questions about him yet.
*  I didn't I didn't love how he played today, but I also think he had a
*  really weird season.
*  The Mitchell shot less too.
*  I mean, he was taking even less shots in the series.
*  So I think that's going to have the ball.
*  Yeah.
*  Once Mitchell decides, okay, I think the only thing like we need eight
*  Superman minutes and Mitchell even with the flaws is capable of doing
*  that in a way that just not a long list of players in the league.
*  Well, a couple things help Mitchell in this game.
*  I don't think Suggs was the Suggs from the regular season really
*  since he got hurt earlier in the year.
*  And that's not an excuse for Orlando because Mitchell made some
*  great shots, but I just I watched Suggs this year and he was a
*  better defender than he was, especially in this game.
*  And they just every time they there was a break.
*  He was limping around.
*  It seemed like he had like five different injuries and I just think
*  he was really banged up.
*  The other thing was I thought Mosley really helped Cleveland with
*  not using Isaac enough.
*  I didn't understand the Isaac use at all.
*  He put him on Mitchell for two possessions to get the start of the
*  fourth quarter and I was like, here we go.
*  Where the fuck was this all game and the first time they got him in
*  a pick and Mitchell was able to get by whoever the switch was and
*  the second time he took like a bad 28 footer over him.
*  But Isaac was doing that Bill Russell time machine thing and I was
*  like, this is how they get back in it.
*  Just put Isaac on Mitchell for five minutes here and then mostly
*  took him out.
*  Mostly I thought was all over the map in this game.
*  He played ten guys.
*  I just in a game seven.
*  He might be the first guy that played ten guys in a game seven
*  in like 20 years.
*  I'd love to see the stats on that.
*  His rotations were all over the place.
*  Franz didn't have it at all and he just kind of kept putting the
*  offense in his hands.
*  I just didn't understand the coaching.
*  The second unit was so good a few games ago where I thought it
*  changed the game for them.
*  I think that was game four and maybe there's part of it where he
*  felt like, okay, that was worth it.
*  Maybe he's afraid of putting Isaac straight up on Mitchell and
*  then they just screen him and now Isaac's away from everything.
*  I'm just trying to figure it out.
*  Yeah, in 50 trying to think here the last 50 61 minutes Isaac made
*  four shots.
*  So for an offense, right?
*  You can't have him and Franz out there at the same time, right?
*  So he's also missing everything.
*  But maybe the way to do it was just like, we're just going to
*  try to stop you on defense every time and let's have the final
*  score of this game be 70 like a 2004 playoff game.
*  The final score will be 74 to 71 and we're going to contest
*  and switch on everything.
*  This is why you have game seven at home because I think if game
*  seven is in Orlando, I think Orlando wins.
*  So the regular season still matters for Silla still matters.
*  A Coro to by the way with his assignment on Palo.
*  I thought just worked his ass off.
*  Take a job and know as much as we all of Palo.
*  I think there are times where he can kind of get himself stuck
*  because he's so big he can pass out of any.
*  Yeah, like when he picks up his dribble.
*  It's like, okay.
*  Well, I can still maybe hit a turnaround.
*  I can still pass out of this.
*  I can see over the top everybody.
*  But that's kind of what you hope he's going to do like, all
*  right, stop yourself.
*  Stop your own momentum and then be 10 feet away and then not
*  really know what you're going to and there's so many Palo
*  turnarounds where I'm like, oh, that's probably not the shot
*  you want and then it goes in that it's it's hard to get on
*  him too much.
*  But I can't even really even be critical of him despite the
*  overall shooting numbers for tonight because it's like well,
*  he was the only one doing anything for such large chunks
*  of this game.
*  Yeah, you needed the one irrational confidence.
*  They even needed like the Max Drew's three threes and five
*  minutes guy and they just anything that that guy was not
*  on their bench.
*  Let's we're going to take a break for the podcast and stay
*  on YouTube and come back and talk about what does Orlando
*  do.
*  All right, coming back.
*  See, that's how we do it folks.
*  All right.
*  So Orlando big picture.
*  Hey man, seven game series.
*  We were leading in halftime feeling great.
*  We're young team.
*  We have cap space like this is a positive year for us.
*  Don't get too shaken by that.
*  The negatives bronze is just not with the offensive game he has
*  now and he's been in the league now a couple years.
*  I don't think you can comfortably say if we're a title team,
*  he can be the second best guy.
*  Not positive.
*  He could be the third best guy.
*  So to me he's in like where Michael Porter jr.
*  Is on Denver where you can't be the first or second best guy
*  and maybe you can't even be the third best guy.
*  But if you're the fourth best guy, that's awesome.
*  And maybe that's who he is.
*  The only thing that would change that is if he shoots a million
*  kajillion threes this summer and at least fixes that a little
*  but this was all year.
*  He couldn't make a three all year and I'm starting to wonder
*  maybe that's who this is a really good slash slasher guy
*  who teams are going to leave open.
*  I don't understand it because as we said in the beginning
*  with his college stats like I went back and looked at some
*  of the stuff.
*  I'm like it's actually higher than you would think he was 35
*  he was 36.
*  He was 28% from three this year, but after the All-Star break
*  it just fell off.
*  He was just under 19% after 25 games.
*  There's there's no way.
*  And some of those are open.
*  I just can't fathom that that's who he's going to be this
*  whole time.
*  So the whole first second third clearly he's not a first
*  year.
*  They won 47 games this year.
*  So before we start predicting like hey, can they be in the
*  short list of four or five teams that win a title that they're
*  not there.
*  I still feel really good about what they've done and that they
*  have somebody in Palo has a chance to be one of those
*  players.
*  So maybe in comparison like some of these other teams you
*  could argue they were even ahead of schedule.
*  If you were them.
*  I mean Mitchell now he just beat them but Mitchell could be
*  one of the guys who's on the market this summer.
*  If he's like I'm not extending he's got a year left on his
*  deal and then teams will be lining up and everybody seems
*  to think he wants to go to New York Miami's always looming
*  but it does feel like Orlando is a possibility for them.
*  There's the Paul George free agent signing possibility and
*  then there's the Hail Mary of Booker saying this son situation
*  sucks.
*  Get me out of here, which I think is unrealistic.
*  What kind of player would you want for them?
*  Who are you looking for?
*  Who's on your who's on your Christmas list for them?
*  It has to be it's funny because I actually think like two
*  Warriors would fit the bill here.
*  Where you go.
*  All right.
*  Well could Chris Paul play 20 minutes and unclog some of
*  these because what I don't want them to do is I don't want
*  them to bring in somebody so ball-dominant that then it
*  takes away from some of the Palos possessions.
*  It gets it's one of the hardest things with all these
*  talented players would be like who overlaps and then who
*  compliments with their skill set or really even their
*  mindset how they want to attack the game.
*  So I think they need some kind of guard.
*  That's a little bit more deferential that could still
*  shoot but you know, I don't know what people think of
*  Chris Paul now at this point and I don't know if this team
*  would be good enough for him to sign on for less money and
*  that's why I still think clay is going to make a lot of
*  money somewhere and because on top everything else.
*  He's a great teammate.
*  He's a good dude.
*  Yeah, and I think despite the Sacramento game in the play
*  elimination.
*  He salvaged himself somewhat this season from the lows of
*  him, you know, most have in these open therapy sessions
*  with the media after the game, which is not surprising for
*  somebody like him and his stature to go through everything
*  he went through.
*  So we could sit here and say Paul George and maybe you know,
*  I don't know what brain and Ingram's availability is going
*  to be but it has to be sure in an Ingram.
*  I don't think makes sense for this team.
*  No, not at all.
*  But I'm just for name.
*  I mean there are other night because I thought the same
*  thing.
*  I was like Ingram Franz.
*  Is there something there?
*  And then it's like, well, why would New Orleans want to
*  turn Ingram into Franz and well, they might admit.
*  I think you're being a little hard.
*  Like if this is who you think Franz is going to be then I
*  can't win the argument.
*  I just don't think he has the same.
*  I don't think he has the same stock that Ingram has.
*  Oh, yes.
*  So Rudy points out that, you know, they have the ability to
*  do the Van Vliet contract with somebody where it's like,
*  whoa, right two for 80 and we've been talking about Malik
*  Monk to the magic for two months here and that's the kind
*  of guy they needed in this series.
*  They, you know, are like a Tyler hero who I think I
*  realized during the Celtic series.
*  His destiny is probably he's like white Lou Williams,
*  right?
*  He's like this awesome six-man score guy, but not not
*  somebody who's going to be one of your three best guys,
*  but they need like a monk like a hero somebody who can
*  come in run the offense, take some shots, be a heat check
*  guy and then those guys are out there.
*  There's a few of those in the league.
*  Feel like they could get one of those dudes.
*  It was the thing that roster was missing this year.
*  Paul George.
*  I said this on Thursday's pot.
*  I went to the Wednesday quipper Mavs game.
*  You were there too.
*  And they do the starting lineups and they were like in
*  his 14th year from whatever Paul George and I'm like,
*  whoa, it's going to be year 15 for him next year.
*  And and and he's got a metal rod in his leg and it's
*  like here's 200 million Paul George.
*  It's like, do you feel afraid about that?
*  Because I'm not positive.
*  I do especially if you're Orlando and you have some
*  of the injury history they've had over the years with
*  rich with rich superstars that they've signed.
*  So I don't know.
*  I don't know what the answer is, but maybe when
*  palace 21, maybe they're maybe it's not like a rush,
*  you know, maybe this is baby steps.
*  They don't have to make their version of the Mitchell
*  trader that go bear trade.
*  Take your time.
*  I was wondering, you know, if this is bad and again,
*  I think we probably ask a lot of these same questions
*  depending on how far Cleveland glows.
*  But if you were New Orleans, but see any any Mitchell
*  trade for Mitchell, I had I had it written down.
*  I think it's the most logical non big city team for him.
*  The next thing doesn't make any sense anymore.
*  And unless he just goes, hey, force me to Brooklyn
*  and that's the only place I really want to go and then
*  he controls the transaction more than the teams do.
*  But I can't imagine it's a real long list of teams
*  where you'd be like, yeah, I'll go see how it is in
*  New Orleans and I'll I'll sign an extension there.
*  I thought David Griffin was really revealing and interesting.
*  Yeah, during that that was pretty rare because a lot of teams.
*  I mean, the whole model is set up for all of these players
*  that feel like failures and all these front office to go.
*  Like I guess we didn't really do it.
*  But, you know, part of part of what he was talking about
*  where he was like, hey, for a certain stretch, we had the
*  best net rating.
*  And like I was like, come on, like, you know, yeah, because
*  I think you can take these snapshots of seasons where you
*  can talk yourself into your team being like at this level
*  that it's not really at.
*  And this year is incredibly frustrating because of the way
*  Zion goes out in that playing game against the Lakers.
*  But then for him to say, like, I think we've seen this group
*  enough that we can't come back and then you're like, oh,
*  okay.
*  All right.
*  Well, let's we agree.
*  We let's party Griffin.
*  Yeah, I thought it was very honest and revealing once he
*  kind of built to the point of saying the stuff that they
*  did well and that he was proud of because I think there's a
*  version of that Pelicans thing where ends a little bit
*  better if they had had Zion to close.
*  I wouldn't have picked him against OKC even with healthy
*  Zion, but that feels like the team, but it's never been a
*  destination.
*  It's never he's ever gone.
*  Hey, I want to go there.
*  Yeah.
*  And especially you're signing up for a basketball situation
*  because I assume Ingram would have to be in that chair to
*  maybe even McCollum with Mitchell and picks and now your
*  your future is tied to whether Zion decides whether he wants
*  to be in shape or not.
*  But the problem for Mitchell is I you know, he wants to
*  be in New York and I just don't see how Brunson and Mitchell
*  makes sense.
*  I've argued with Nick fan friends about we're already talking
*  about Mitchell trades.
*  Meanwhile, he had 89 points in a game six and a game seven
*  and you know, you could have made jokes about his suitcases
*  were packed at halftime.
*  He's ready to go, but he he really wanted to win that game
*  and I thought like even that the stuff they showed on the
*  sidelines with him trying to get Garland going like that
*  was some of the best leader stuff I've seen from him in a
*  game like he really took that game on didn't want to the
*  season end.
*  So that made me think like well, maybe maybe Cleveland is
*  the best situation for him.
*  He goes to Brooklyn.
*  Who's he playing with?
*  I mean Bridges has to be in that trade.
*  So now it's just hey, it's Donovan Mitchell and a bunch of
*  ninth men, you know, he goes to the Knicks with what's
*  happened with Brunson.
*  I don't know if I mess with the Brunson thing and like here's
*  another ball-dominant guy like you just compared Mitchell in
*  an unironic way to like there's a little Westbrook in him,
*  which I didn't disagree with.
*  I don't know how you put that with Brunson.
*  So then you start thinking about Miami start thinking about
*  Lakers.
*  What if LeBron's like draft Bronte?
*  I want to come home but New Orleans from a basketball sense
*  might make the second most sense.
*  I think Cleveland makes the most basketball sense for him.
*  Yeah, that's if you're I'm just not sure as much as I like
*  both of them.
*  Whenever I was watching Atlanta this year, I'd be like man,
*  it just feels like Trey and Dejante don't really play
*  basketball together.
*  Like they stagger their minutes and when they do play the game
*  together, it feels just very taking turns ish like it doesn't
*  really feel like they're ever playing ball together.
*  And I think it's been a little bit better at times with Garland
*  and Mitchell, but it's kind of gets back to the original point
*  of like what I would want Orlando to have and that's somebody
*  that's complimentary to Palo and not somebody that's overlapping
*  and it's you it would be so hard not just one.
*  Yeah, but I mean just like in Mitchell and Garland you go,
*  okay, cool.
*  I have two guys who can shoot two guys who can handle two
*  guys who can play make and two guys that can drive and get
*  to the hoop especially with Mitch.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  That's his greatest skill of like I really really need to
*  get to the hoop and some of these stretches and we saw that
*  so much in the last two games from him, which is just really
*  special to be able to do that in the playoffs and we've seen
*  him do it before but then I look at Brunson and I'm telling
*  you like I love this Knicks team.
*  This is one of my favorite teams in years, but then I'm
*  honest with myself and go, okay, but like what do you actually
*  think they're capable of?
*  Can you know that the cab that makes sense on that team is
*  actually Jared Allen.
*  You're gonna like pick a cab that could make whatever everything
*  that we like about this next team better.
*  You take Jared Allen.
*  I think Jared Allen works on a ton of different teams and I'm
*  sure cast fans are losing it right now as they just won game
*  seven.
*  We're talking about potential trades.
*  Traded nine times because we maybe we just the rules are we
*  shouldn't be doing this, but I think it speaks more to the
*  Brunson point and all the Mitchell rumors and like how
*  important today was but again may have just delayed all of
*  the stuff that we're doing anyway.
*  I don't want to mess with Brunson, but I also don't know
*  if you can survive through say three playoff rounds with that
*  being your offense and him taking like 30 shots a game.
*  It's awesome.
*  But can can you actually do that?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't I don't think the history doesn't tell you this
*  works.
*  Well, we're about to find out over the next two runs.
*  I had a thing written down.
*  It's a borderline.
*  I'd say I tell Kyle to turn the Tik Tok camera on but we have
*  the YouTube camera on who is Boston rooting for in that game.
*  Probably Cleveland.
*  I think so too, which is weird because they proved they were
*  better than Orlando, but I think if the goal is like don't put
*  a lot of miles on us and round two.
*  Try don't just get in a weird basketball situation.
*  That's unconventional.
*  Orlando is kind of a funky matchup for them.
*  They've a lot of lot of defenders to throw at different
*  guys in the cells can get in their heads to muck it up.
*  I didn't want to muck it up series for them around too.
*  I want them to keep the flow they have in Cleveland.
*  They'll have a better flow Mitchell win one game, but
*  Boston, you know, they should have swept the series with
*  them this year except for the Dean Wade game.
*  Dean Wade came in left his body.
*  Hopefully.
*  I don't know if he's coming back for round two.
*  Maybe I'd be a little more nervous, but I felt the same
*  way.
*  I was like, I'm actually a little more nervous of Orlando
*  in this next round than in Cleveland.
*  Does that sound insane though?
*  Like are we you think people are listening this going that's
*  nuts Cleveland just won the series Mitchell is the best
*  player on either team.
*  Wait, you think Mitchell's better than well better than
*  anyone in this series not better than better than Palo.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I'm talking about Mitchell versus Palo.
*  Just double-checking.
*  That's what I thought.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it halfway through?
*  I was like, I think he meant this series.
*  It's just the length.
*  It's just the length defensive thing.
*  I think sometimes defense with Boston they can get into
*  some bad habits offensively.
*  Right.
*  And Orlando could muck that up with that said after watching
*  Mosley play 10 guys and then put Jonathan Isaac on ice in
*  the fourth quarter now retroactive.
*  I'm like, I wish we got in Orlando.
*  That would have been I wish we wish we'd caught against
*  watching Frans go one for 25 and it gave 7 Orlando probably
*  would have been a better pick.
*  I don't think it's a definitive answer.
*  Like Boston should they're gonna be the team.
*  They should be able to like if they're this good and as
*  good as they looked through the four games against Miami,
*  like that's that series ended up playing out the way that
*  it should have with the one blip historic three-point
*  shooting game.
*  Yeah, it's not like it went six tough games.
*  You're like what the hell are they doing this again?
*  Right.
*  They killed them four times and then they lost a random
*  game.
*  Right.
*  They should still be dramatically better than either
*  the two teams that played today.
*  Some of the stuff Mitchell was doing in this game.
*  I was trying to think of other guards that I've seen and
*  the only other guy I could think of was Duane Wade like
*  late 2000s this these guards that are not huge guys, but
*  Super physical and have a way of going to the basket the
*  same way like somebody like in beadwood or Lebron wood,
*  but they're small and how they use their body and protect
*  the ball and bounce off dudes and are just constantly guys
*  are sprawling backwards.
*  You're like, was that an offensive foul?
*  What happened on that?
*  And they'll show the replay.
*  I was like, I mean, it feels like he just muscled that
*  guy backwards and then just gets this weird layup.
*  I don't think I've seen a lot of guards in my life that
*  have some of the moves that he has and it's weird.
*  It comes and goes because sometimes he seems super happy
*  to just take 25 footers and not play that way.
*  And then other times when he plays that way, it's like,
*  oh shit, how do you stop this?
*  I think you stop it with length, which is why I wanted
*  them to put Isaac on him.
*  But who else is like him to you?
*  Darren Williams used to be just really good at creating
*  all-side.
*  He used to have this crossover that was nasty, but then
*  he also would just go right at you like get his shoulder
*  into your chest and he would create now look, I think
*  Mitchell's probably a little quicker than Darren Williams
*  is but peak Darren Williams.
*  I mean probably argues even better than Mitchell.
*  He was just so nasty and he was so physical even though
*  you thought of him probably more as a prototypical not
*  prototypical, but what he just felt a little bit more
*  point guard ish than maybe Rachel does.
*  But my favorite thing for Mitchell was just you go through
*  enough of these games.
*  You've got a little bit of a playoff resume.
*  It's not like amazing for Mitchell as far as the lack
*  of distance that he's gone with other teams that he's
*  been with but just seeing like, hey, you know, what's
*  screwing us up on offense is when we wait around when
*  we let Orlando get settled again off the first thing
*  that we're doing when that was maybe part of the Boston
*  answer where it's like when Boston gets a little clogged,
*  they can just kind of stand there and then it's like,
*  okay, but you're making it easier for the defense and
*  Mitchell it felt like the light went off with him was
*  like stop waiting.
*  Stop waiting is like soon as you come off the screen go
*  as soon as you have the ball go as soon as somebody
*  thinks they're coming up like make a decision there and
*  some of these guys that are so good in the regular season
*  it almost takes them like a bit of a wake-up call being
*  like, oh, I guess I can't just like screw around and
*  wait to do something offensively because they're right
*  on top of me.
*  Well, I thought that was Minnesota yesterday to some
*  degree that they were playing.
*  They were playing with a pace and I can't wait to talk
*  about that series.
*  But for the Celtics to win this series the way that
*  they should I think they're going to need Tatum and
*  Brown to guard Mitchell because he you know, people
*  haven't seen the Celtics that much like, oh, they'll
*  just put white and drew on Mitchell and it's actually
*  not what they do sometimes.
*  Sometimes they like to throw the forwards with link at
*  the guard and then they use the guards like to the
*  guard three-point shooters and help off and it would
*  be interesting if Tatum was like, let me take Mitchell
*  out this series.
*  I don't think he would do it because I think he'd want
*  to match, you know, there's some ego stuff like, no, I
*  want I'll match him on our end.
*  But I like sometimes when and they've done this a few
*  times this season when Tatum's like, let me take that
*  guy out.
*  We have enough offense.
*  I'll be the one that guards him and Jaylen will do
*  the same thing every once while they have so many guys
*  to throw at him that it's going to have to be somebody
*  else.
*  I think that that ships in with the Cavs.
*  It can't be like tonight, you know, it's going to like
*  Garland's going to have to show up or mobile is going
*  to have to start putting together the 2015.
*  So streus is going to have to hit more threes streus
*  a semi Boston killer.
*  I'm not giving him total Boston killer status, but he
*  had a couple moments against them.
*  I don't blame you forever being horrified by everybody
*  that was involved with that team last year, but yeah,
*  that's the advantage Boston should have with a team
*  that feels like there's the one guy and let's Garland
*  gets the shooting going again and he just needs to be
*  more aggressive shooting.
*  I think he's good enough to to be better than he was
*  this past season or series I should say, but if you're
*  trying to just screen into Horford all the time, like
*  the two people are just going to stay with Mitchell
*  constantly because if Alan isn't back like Alan provides
*  maybe a little bit more spacing than Mobley does and
*  I know that doesn't necessarily sound right because
*  Mobley still supposedly going to shoot from the outside,
*  but you would just leave whoever the big guy is setting
*  that screen.
*  You're probably not going to close.
*  You're going to say go ahead like make your first three
*  shots and we're going to do it a fourth time and ignore
*  you, right?
*  Feel free to make 1620 footers in this game.
*  What do you think the line of the series is on Fandl?
*  Celtics Cavs.
*  Boston minus 500.
*  Boston minus 1600.
*  The Cavs are plus 820 underdogs.
*  This is without Porzingis.
*  Celtics in four is plus 185.
*  Celtics in five is plus 175.
*  Celtics in six is plus 470.
*  The last time the Cavs won a playoff series was 2018
*  game seven.
*  The weekend of bricks Rockets Warriors and Cavs Celtics
*  game sevens when they combined for 275 mysteries between
*  the two teams just to parade a barrage of bricks.
*  So now it's back Cleveland and Cleveland and Boston.
*  We'll see how that goes.
*  Let's uh, let's take one more break for the podcast and
*  then we'll come back on YouTube and we'll talk about our
*  guy Anthony Edwards.
*  Did I hit everything I did?
*  All right, we're coming back.
*  So Minnesota Denver.
*  I was looking up.
*  We're actually where do you want to start with Minnesota
*  Denver?
*  I'll let you lead because I know like that that level of
*  basketball yesterday was and I saw you last night because
*  we went to go see Shane Gillis, but we were both on a high
*  after game one Minnesota Denver just about as good of a
*  playoff basketball game one as you're going to get in a
*  series.
*  Yeah, I almost said no to Gillis just because I was like
*  do I can I emotionally pivot that quickly after like I was
*  kind of thinking about where I would be during the day and
*  I was like, well this I cannot believe this is a second
*  round series.
*  I can't believe we're this lucky.
*  I think I would start with the defense kind of like what
*  we talked about there a little bit in the beginning and
*  it's a lot of like more Phoenix is like, are you serious
*  like Booker with Jada Mcdannis going like our weight like
*  this is the whole game.
*  This is what we're going to do like I'm not even at half
*  court yet and I'm worried about getting it over and you
*  saw that with Murray and Murray had another slow start.
*  Although you know that wasn't the biggest problem when
*  they were up 18 for I'm like, okay, well Denver isn't going
*  to get it run off the floor and that wasn't the case ant
*  the cat stretch the Nas stretch like there's a lot of
*  really good things in there.
*  I think the alarming thing if you were Denver and you
*  watch the film from it is you're like man.
*  They got good looks the whole time.
*  And Denver did not know Denver worked really hard.
*  Hey my biggest fear for Denver in this series and I
*  bought I'm rooting for Denver because I because I just
*  like yolkage and I like Denver and I like when teams
*  try to go back to back but I'm also rooting for Minnesota
*  because I have a pretty large Celtics Timberwolves
*  finals bet at 16 to 1 so I was kind of like back and
*  forth couldn't decide where I was going.
*  But the thing that alarmed me for Denver was I was
*  like man.
*  There's a recipe where they're just throwing these big
*  guys at yolkage and they're just making him work the
*  whole game and it's just two and a half hours of just
*  not fun to be yolkage in this game.
*  There's that but then there's like the McDaniels
*  Edwards just them taking turns on Murray and just
*  making his life miserable and if those two things are
*  happening simultaneously what else is going on for
*  Denver and that entire game one was just if Minnesota
*  is going to play defense like this and then they're
*  getting the ant piece on the other end and he's going
*  to be able to rise to that level offensively Denver
*  can't beat them.
*  The question is can he do that again?
*  Is that who he is or did he have a really good game
*  because if he's there or close Minnesota is going to
*  win the series.
*  I picked Minnesota.
*  It was a coin toss for me because I didn't really like
*  picking against Denver, especially him having the
*  home court and when the go-bare Towns things works,
*  it's go-bare just swallowing up Gordon and then he's
*  left to roam off of Gordon because of Gordon tries to
*  stretch the floor by sitting in the corners that go-bares
*  is not going to pay attention to him.
*  Yeah, but then you have the Towns foul piece where I
*  mean you had a tweet on this the other week and I don't
*  know that it got enough credit his foul habits are
*  atrocious.
*  Yeah, he just decides to get these awful.
*  He had to in like a minute when he came back in yesterday.
*  We were like, do you not want to play today?
*  I actually was wondering if if Mike and or he was in
*  for Finch, but I'm sure it's really Finches call because
*  he's sitting there right on the bench.
*  But when Nas was so good, I was like, do you actually go
*  back to Towns because we talked about this last night
*  they put Towns in with like two minutes left and it was
*  like we kind of know what do you think the game?
*  Why do you think they did that because they didn't want
*  it to be a story after the game that Towns was benched
*  for the last seven minutes.
*  There's no other reason it Nas was the second best guy
*  they had in the second half of that game.
*  You're not taking him out.
*  They had to take it out for you could lose Towns potentially
*  if you're just sitting him for the last seven minutes.
*  That was why they did it.
*  I think you're right.
*  So if Towns gets in a foul trouble, then I think like,
*  okay, so that means Rudy has to play Jokic straight up.
*  And if you look at Jokic when he has just Rudy he goes
*  right out.
*  He doesn't really have that much fear of him at all.
*  I wouldn't say it's as excited as he gets when Rui was
*  on him in the first round where it was like, oh my God.
*  Oh my God, you know, give me the ball.
*  Give me the ball.
*  I'm actually not going to pass here.
*  He has no concern because I think he always thinks he
*  can get but the problem is if it's Towns and then Rudy
*  hot helping off of Gordon, I mean 11 to 25 and two from
*  nine from three.
*  I mean you could stick nine threes in that game because
*  he'll also like have moments.
*  There's like, all right, I got to get going.
*  I did start taking tougher shots here.
*  So I don't know that you're going to get that from Jokic
*  again, but left out the Nasas.
*  No, that's that's the other piece of this.
*  Yeah, that's the point that we get it to is like the
*  Towns gets it a foul trouble.
*  You start thinking.
*  Oh, then it's Rudy straight up on him.
*  It's like well, yeah, but they have this Nas piece against
*  the Denver team that doesn't have another big they feel
*  good about playing well and then the other way they were
*  using Nas and I know I listen this if I ever get hit by
*  a bus and they're like, what are the things you truly
*  cared about and list like 12 things.
*  I really want one of them to be if the other team isn't
*  using their point card to bring up the ball just pressure
*  than 94 feet because Minnesota went in this game.
*  It's like Jokic is going to bring the ball up.
*  We're going to fucking make him work where I like Nas
*  was picking him up at the top of the three-point line
*  on the other on their side of the court and just hounding
*  and pushing him and I thought they did something.
*  I watch a Tony Jokic.
*  That was the first time I've seen a team speed him up
*  where he he was playing at a speed that I felt like was
*  10% faster than maybe he was happy about and they managed
*  to do it and they got him where he just I never felt
*  like he was totally in control of the game.
*  His stats were fine.
*  But in terms of like the typical Jokic Meister thing now part
*  of it.
*  This is why game 2 is going to be so interesting.
*  You're coming off a Lakers game where you know, they
*  they just figured out the Lakers and when they really
*  needed a score in them and the who to attack and who to
*  get into a switch and all that me just figured it out.
*  He controlled the pace.
*  They never pressured him.
*  So he's going to adjust because he's a genius at basketball.
*  But I'm going to my big thing for game 2 is can they speed
*  him up like that again?
*  Have you ever seen him?
*  I don't want to say he was frantic, but he just seemed
*  like a little over caffeinated.
*  That's not normally what he's like.
*  I thought there was stuff around the rim where he just
*  wasn't I expect everything to go in.
*  Okay, so like his touch.
*  It's like he's placing the ball up towards the rim the
*  same way.
*  We're comparing him to the greatest players ever.
*  Right.
*  So I'm not worried about him at all, but I would agree there
*  were certain things throughout the course of the day.
*  We're like, oh, that feels a little non Jokish-y and Porter
*  continues to have these stretches when the offense around
*  him doesn't really have much going on.
*  I mean, he had some stretches during LA where you're like
*  that was kind of the game.
*  Murray.
*  He was six of 14 his shooting numbers from three were fine.
*  He's only two or four, but he was below 30% against the
*  Lakers.
*  So I don't know how much of the calf thing is there.
*  Did you would it can I do my percentages on him?
*  Yeah, I love it.
*  81 74 84 that seems high.
*  He fought it felt like 84% healthy to me, but they were
*  clearly trying to put miles on him that whole game.
*  They were like, let's this guy's watch McDaniel's.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go.
*  McDaniel's had some early opportunities offensively where
*  you're like, all right, that's a maker.
*  You know, they're turning the ball over and I'm like this
*  discourse should be bigger.
*  Like they should have a bigger lead than they have right now
*  because still some of these looks are really good.
*  And then you have the ant thing that I can't believe we took
*  this long to get to because it's so much fun.
*  The shot making is absurd, but Pope provides zero resistance
*  to him at all.
*  Like it's not even close when he has pulled one on one
*  so much bigger than him.
*  Yeah, it's there's like, I don't know how that's solved
*  unless it's an effort thing, but Pope who we like defensively
*  and you think hey, that's a nice little option to have out
*  there.
*  Whether it was both borderline elite defender, I would say
*  and it was just getting demolished demolished.
*  Do you know that?
*  Did you read the back story on those guys?
*  With the Georgia background.
*  Yeah, and like it they like Pope's known him for a while
*  and it's like a big brother to aunt and it's like he's my
*  big brother, but I'm gonna fucking destroy him.
*  Serious like it talks the best shit of anyone.
*  I think we've had in a while.
*  I want to get to some man stuff in a second, but what's
*  big picture for this series Denver was a minus 205 favorite
*  heading into game one.
*  Denver is now a plus 108 favorite Rossello.
*  Denver and seven was plus 410 24 hours ago.
*  Now it's plus 350.
*  A Minnesota sweep is down to plus 550 and the reason I bring
*  this up.
*  I know you just made a face.
*  Well, come on, you know, I like no don't give me the come
*  on.
*  I'm just gonna I'm not saying it to you, but I just want to
*  talk it out for a split second.
*  It's just just so disrespectful to even ask this.
*  Go ahead.
*  This is this is why it's gonna be good content.
*  I was saying because I'm gonna do a whole thing about the
*  history of ant and some of the the pool that he's swimming
*  in right now.
*  This T Wolves team a little similar where this team has
*  the look and I don't know if it's legitimate or not, but
*  we've seen it a couple times in the history of the league
*  where it was like the Bulls against the Pistons in 91.
*  You're like man, they really kind of kick their ass in game
*  one.
*  What did that mean?
*  Ah, the Pistons will come back and it's like, oh, they're
*  down.
*  Oh, too.
*  Well, they're going back to Detroit.
*  It'll be fine.
*  Oh shit.
*  Are they gonna lose game three?
*  And then all of a sudden it's a sweep, right?
*  Same thing with Pistons Lakers, which wasn't a sweep in
*  04 where you know, I think the Lakers won game one or game
*  two and then it went to Detroit and it's like, ah, the Lakers
*  will steal game four.
*  And it's like, oh, they're getting their asses kicked.
*  Oh, this series over because the 04 Pistons had the look
*  and the other one I was thinking was the 14 Spurs when
*  they split the series the first two with Miami and it
*  went back to Miami and then they killed them in game three.
*  And people are like, oh Miami lock it down.
*  They're going to win tonight.
*  And I remember going on TV being like, I think there's
*  a chance like San Antonio might have figured this out and
*  like the series this this like the Miami's in real trouble
*  here and Miami remember they were down 20 points in every
*  one of those games.
*  This might just be this might just be a great spot for
*  Minnesota is my point.
*  There are historical examples of a team coming off like
*  a long title run and just running into the wrong buzzsaw
*  at the wrong time.
*  That's a wrong matchup for them and they're a little
*  banged up and I would be afraid of that if I was a Denver
*  fan.
*  I'm still picking Denver to win in seven, but to me every
*  possibility is on the board now 2012 Thunder Lakers is
*  one I thought of.
*  Well, that's a good one.
*  Yeah, because I was like, wait, these guys are like giving
*  it to them.
*  They're not even remotely afraid of them at all.
*  Right?
*  Like this isn't supposed to happen this soon and that group
*  ends up making it to the finals.
*  They lost the first two to San Antonio, San Antonio when
*  I was like, okay, well, you know, they're just not going
*  to be ready enough to beat them and then they won four
*  straight where all the things I liked about San Antonio
*  the athleticism of the Thunderbird just overwhelming
*  as that series.
*  That's a good that's a really good example.
*  Thank you for helping my theory.
*  So I just don't like it.
*  I just I just it was the first game, you know, Minnesota
*  hasn't lost a playoff game yet.
*  So I would imagine the vibes are that's another thing that
*  ties into that theory like the bull.
*  The 91 Bulls, I think they lost two games and like one
*  of them was in overtime.
*  They if I mean the bigger thing is if ants going to look
*  like that, they're going to win the series and I was trying
*  I went back.
*  I did a little homework.
*  I went back, you know, he scored 36 in his first playoff
*  game ever.
*  MJ scored 30 plus in his second playoff game ever.
*  Kobe was until his 30th playoff game.
*  He was younger Wade 14th playoff game.
*  He scored 41 in his eighth playoff game ever, which is
*  better than everyone but MJ his last three games.
*  39.7 points for three-game stretch.
*  She's 22 years old and you go back MJ his three Boston games.
*  He was 23 43.7 Kobe when he had that 48 pointer against
*  Sacramento, which is like one of the great YouTube games.
*  That's like if you're going to make the case for the 2001
*  Lakers is the best team of all time like the game for the
*  Sacramento and I was like, oh and Shaq was also on this team,
*  but he had three in a row and he averaged 43 a game and
*  Wade was another one where he you know, he had little
*  stretches like that Jerry West but like the stuff ants doing
*  right now historically.
*  It's a different level.
*  It's not just oh my God.
*  Oh, he yeah, he looks like MJ.
*  It's like he's doing stuff that the greatest two guards of
*  all time.
*  We're doing at this point of their careers when it seemed it
*  seemed early, but it wasn't and that's what that thick to me.
*  The ceiling is now even higher because of just what his last
*  three games looked like the stuff he was doing yesterday to
*  Caldwell Pope was like kind of post baseball MJ stuff and late
*  2000s Kobe stuff and mid-2000s Wade stuff like a some sort
*  of combination of all that were like the young athletes stuff,
*  but also like this wherewithal of how to back somebody down
*  shoot these beautiful turnarounds.
*  It's fucking crazy like for 22 year old do that is fucking
*  crazy.
*  And if I'm Denver, I'm terrified right now.
*  Yeah, that might just be the part of like all of this where
*  when I was trying to figure out, you know, and I changed
*  my mind a bunch leading up to game one and even though game
*  one played out the way it does.
*  I'm like sitting here like victory laughing like, all right.
*  Yep.
*  I picked the Timberwolves like cuz I knew it but yeah, whenever
*  I think about all the different things that could or couldn't
*  happen in a series like I can't get past the fact like maybe
*  ant is just as special.
*  I mean, we obviously love him.
*  We've talked him up.
*  It's usually not how this works.
*  There was a number that Goldsberry had the other day players
*  that have scored 35 plus in three straight playoff games
*  at 22 or younger.
*  It's Kareem Kobe LeBron and ant like what if this is just the
*  beginning and like he gets one of these early they get out
*  of the West like he might just be that good and that might
*  be the simple reason, you know, instead of like, okay, well
*  it means that they had, you know, look all these other parts
*  of it are certainly important if they're going to knock off
*  a team as good as Denver, but there's there's always like I'll
*  spend all this time looking at it like hey, maybe just ant is
*  that sick.
*  Maybe he's just looked up doesn't matter that shout out to
*  basketball reference.
*  I looked up on stat had 23 and under 28 points or more 45%
*  field goal or more and just who's on the list and it's like
*  all the greatest players, you know, it's Durant's 2012, which
*  by the way was incredible that season which you mentioned
*  earlier.
*  It's Kobe in 2001.
*  It's Luke and 22.
*  It's Jerry West of 1962 Kareem's first year Bob McAdoo.
*  It just goes on and on and ant has to because last year he
*  did it too.
*  He's just Michael Jordan Oscar like this is a different
*  pool is swimming in to use the pool analogy again, but the
*  shot looking this good this early.
*  I mean he was under 30% from three from college.
*  The team wasn't any good.
*  So you couldn't I had a hard time with it with him where I
*  was like is he taking bad shots which is part of it like the
*  team wasn't very good, but there was just a lot of bad decisions.
*  He's really raw.
*  He's a super athlete.
*  He's got the ball a ton and you're on like, all right.
*  Well, you know, is he going to turn to this and then he just
*  physically pretty quickly you would watch him the NBA like
*  now he's next to NBA guys.
*  You're like that guy looks like the most impressive person
*  out there of the ten guys running around just looks so
*  athletically easy for him sometimes so he played when he
*  went full court lefty.
*  Yeah in the fourth quarter when it seemed like they wanted
*  a foul, but they weren't sure and ant just went 94 feet
*  left-handed for a layup and it just looked like he was a high
*  score in an eighth grade basketball game like think about
*  what he's shown now is that he can he can drive at his size
*  and get to the hoop and then once he's at the rim against
*  traffic.
*  He figures out a way with like a little nobody's Kyrie's
*  finishing package, but there's certain things with him where
*  you're like is he closed off does he have an angle?
*  Yeah, he has an angle.
*  He brought it up and under on this one or he finished left
*  hand on this one.
*  I say, okay, so no one can really stay in front of him.
*  If you stay even with him, he's probably going to be more
*  physical than you he's going to be quicker.
*  He's going to be stronger and then he has all the this all of
*  these things that he can do.
*  He can shoot threes his playmaking this year is incredible.
*  And now if he wants to slow it down in a playoff game and he
*  gets like the spacing he wants like he had a play where
*  Jokic was waiting for him in the paint and he may have had
*  red.
*  It might not have been Pope on this one, but you could see the
*  whole time.
*  He was trying to find a way to either bring Jokic further out
*  to him for a pass or if Jokic didn't come completely out to
*  him, he was going to turn to his right shoulder and shoot it
*  on the left side and like he was saying it all happened and
*  you could see the play was just slow.
*  So it wasn't hard to figure out what he was doing, but he was
*  waiting for like the perfect positioning of where the
*  defense was at was like, well, if Jokic stays where he is now,
*  they I don't have a passing lane.
*  So that means a shots going to be on me.
*  It's a little late in the shot clock.
*  Let me turn and go this way on top of that.
*  Then he plays awesome defense.
*  So there's awesome defense.
*  There's nothing about him.
*  You're like we're getting a 27 28 year old package for a guy
*  who's 22 years old and that's not supposed to happen.
*  I was looking back because I remembered his rookie year.
*  There was a game and you and I had both just randomly watched
*  it and we were texting each other's like, did you see that
*  because I went back.
*  I looked at his game log.
*  He was bad for the first two months like really, you know,
*  that was the coming out of the COVID season, but his stats
*  are bad.
*  And then there's this game.
*  Let's say it's like two thirds of the season against Phoenix
*  and it was the sons team that went to the finals.
*  And I think this was the game you and I texted about when
*  he had 42 and there was just, it was just something there.
*  And you look at his stats, like he just gets better as that
*  season goes along.
*  And then the last eight games, he's like 27 a game and he
*  sitting threes and just over the course of the year he jumped
*  and I, but I remember that Phoenix game being like there's
*  something unusual about this.
*  And he's since then hit every checkpoint, but then you look
*  at this season.
*  I feel like he's hit checkpoints during this season, even
*  from like, you know, team USA for the first half of the
*  season to what happened when towns went out when he had
*  this extra burden and he was able to deliver to now what
*  he's been doing in the playoffs.
*  It just feels like he's jumped four levels since team USA.
*  And those team USA guys immediately were like, this is
*  the best guy on our team.
*  Like we, we were wondering if he's going to get minutes and
*  this is like, he's the leader of our team.
*  The other thing I love about him and it really reminds me
*  of early LeBron because I thought LeBron was like an unbelievable
*  teammate on those early Cleveland teams, like the 07 08 09.
*  He just was, he was so much fun to see him personally.
*  He was so happy.
*  He was so inclusive.
*  Like he was just awesome to watch and aunt has that same
*  quality.
*  I think where it's just, he's just the hub of all the
*  activity and the energy and those guys fucking love him.
*  Like they just are completely in on him for for a cat to
*  be miked up and at that one moment in the game, they
*  re-aired the miked up stuff and cats going to him telling
*  him to keep his composure and for aunt not to just laugh
*  hysterically in cat's face.
*  It's like I might vote him for MVP this year, but think
*  about who we're talking like, do you all right?
*  Let me ask it this way because I've already kind of alluded
*  to it.
*  Do you have moments?
*  You're like, maybe he is this special that he's going to win
*  this whole thing now.
*  Yeah, I thought of it yesterday.
*  I watched the second half with Tate and we talked about
*  it and I was just like Tate George Tate George Tate Frazier
*  the ringer's own.
*  We sometimes it happens sooner than you're ready sooner
*  than you think and that's one of the great things about all
*  these guys where we're surprised by the age, but that's
*  really not a good reason to be surprised.
*  You know like Tiger it's like a tiger it's gonna be so much
*  fun to watch him.
*  I'm not comparing the tiger but when Tiger came in, I
*  would be so cool if he can compete for a major and then
*  he fucking won the Masters right away, you know, this is
*  just how it goes.
*  Sometimes guys just come in and they're fucking awesome
*  like Gretzky came into the NHL is like I'm gonna take
*  every record.
*  I don't think he's Gretzky but it there there are people
*  that have come in LeBron made the finals in 2007 with
*  like a fucking G League team.
*  You know like it I look I still think that's one of LeBron's
*  greatest accomplishments of his entire 2011 and 12 that
*  like he took that team the finals.
*  He was slaying dragons every round.
*  We're like, okay, I guess I guess they're ready.
*  So, you know, it's the history of this sport that sometimes
*  guys are early instead of late.
*  Wade I felt like Wade in 05.
*  I think it would happen but he got hurt.
*  Remember that and then it did happen the next year, but
*  I thought that 05 I thought he was ready to take the title
*  that year and it was the second year in the league and
*  it would have been crazy, but it was like, all right, I guess
*  this is happening.
*  So I think it's a good one.
*  Wade's a good one because we're usually don't get the early
*  but then I was thinking about and I'm like, okay, so he's
*  not gonna make first team all NBA if Embiid had been healthy
*  like Embiid MVP Embiid, you know, Embiid might have won
*  another one.
*  It's like yeah, Ant finished seventh.
*  I don't know where Ant's gonna finish.
*  He's not gonna finish the top top top five MVP voting and
*  yet I'll have moments and it's not just because they won game
*  one and I'm not gonna be shocked if Denver comes back and
*  Jokic figure some things out and they're terrific and you
*  know, maybe they have to get a little creative with what they
*  want to do with Ant and then if Ant gets bottled up and
*  all of a sudden nobody else is making shots for two quarter
*  straight from Minnesota.
*  Like I'm not gonna be shocked to see some of that kind of
*  stuff happen, but it would be really just beyond unique of
*  Ant arrives Minnesota wins a championship like it's not
*  supposed to happen this way and then all the postseason
*  stuff comes in you go.
*  He wasn't even top five in MVP and then next year he's going
*  to be the favorite.
*  If those things were to happen, I don't know.
*  Yeah, if Ant wins the title first of all, if he beats Denver
*  and makes the finals, he becomes the biggest under 30 star
*  in the league like that's just like mark it down and he might
*  be getting close may even beat in Denver might do that.
*  He's he's leaving Tatum all those guys in the dust because
*  he's just different.
*  He's got a charisma to him that casual people casual fans
*  can see plus he delivers over and over again.
*  Plus he's so fucking fun to watch.
*  There's a world where they just win the title and he goes to
*  Team USA and you have like, oh, it's going to be LeBron and
*  Steph and Katie's team.
*  How are those guys going to deal with that?
*  Because this I mean now we're where I almost feel like I'm
*  going to get hit by lightning, but the dream team was like
*  that in 92 or it's like, oh, this is going to be the bird
*  and magic and this is going to be and then MJ just took it
*  and it became the Michael Jordan dream team featuring Larry
*  Bird and Magic Johnson and all these other guys.
*  I it's going to be fascinating if he actually wins the title
*  to watch how then that transpires to the dream team and
*  LeBron being like I always knew I knew from the get-go.
*  This is going to happen Fran.
*  I've been telling him.
*  So here's the here's like did you didn't have him obviously
*  we all agreed on where yokich is no one had him ahead of
*  Luca.
*  I don't think anybody had him well because he wasn't SGA
*  SGA had the better year.
*  He wasn't ahead SGA this year, but in the playoffs is averaging
*  33 a game and he's fucking demolishing teams.
*  He demolished Phoenix like he broke them broken and that
*  Denver game was the first time we've seen Denver.
*  The game was tied with seven minutes left and they got out
*  executed and a team had a different energy.
*  But you know, I've been watching hoops long enough that
*  sometimes you can see when a team has the look and I do
*  think Minnesota has the look.
*  I just don't know if Edward it's going to depend on whether
*  Edwards is ready or not to really just start slaying
*  dragons now.
*  But he did it against Phoenix and he did it in game one
*  against Denver and if I'm Denver and I'm thinking
*  man, they have all the shit to throw yokich.
*  It's going to be really hard for him.
*  They have all the shit to throw at Murray.
*  It's going to be really hard on him.
*  Oh, and we don't really have anybody to stop Edwards if
*  he's feeling it that becomes pretty hard series.
*  They have a game seven in Denver.
*  They have the pedigree.
*  We've never seen it in the situation where now this is
*  really sitting there.
*  Is he going to want it too bad?
*  Like there's just levels to this that we've just haven't
*  seen him in the situation yet.
*  But it's it checks a lot of boxes man.
*  Yeah, and we haven't even mentioned the other side of
*  it of like how good Dallas looks now and how great okc
*  looks in the first round too.
*  So like even if he gets through this it's assuming a
*  lot but yeah, whatever.
*  I think it's kind of fun.
*  How funny would it like let's say Minnesota beats Denver
*  and okc beats Dallas and now we end up with Minnesota okc
*  Edwards versus SGA Jalen Williams guarding Edwards size
*  against no size really at all.
*  Ken Chet pull people away from the basket.
*  That's actually a really great basketball series from a
*  nerd standpoint, and then you have these two guys who
*  are the best, you know, other than Luca the best under
*  30 guys, but you know that it's sitting there now for
*  Edwards and the defensive stuff they were doing in that
*  game.
*  Who else has been on that level in this century?
*  The 08 Celtics got there.
*  I feel like the 04 Pistons team was awesome.
*  All five guys could play any other position.
*  Who else?
*  I think San Antonio has always been really good defensively.
*  I think some of those switchy Golden State teams are really
*  good. I was going to say the lineup of death.
*  I felt like could get there and really just get stops
*  for four or five minutes in a row.
*  I just imagine if you're another really good player,
*  whether it was Booker or Murray, they're just I know
*  I've already said it, but you're going like wait what?
*  Like this is and just like, okay, can we just get a
*  screen up here with a guard just so I can get a little
*  angled to get the ball half court get a set up and
*  it's like now ants on me and now yeah now Alexander
*  Walker is on me.
*  Again, he steps up defensively and then you're like,
*  okay, finally got past these guys.
*  Wait, what?
*  Yeah, it's.
*  It's a bear dead in that game yesterday that I've never
*  seen in all the times the two-on-one.
*  Retreat thing on the Gordon pass from Jokic.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, I have you ever seen anyone do that to Jokic
*  before he was the first guy who guessed it.
*  It was like watching somebody pick off Tom Brady
*  and like oh seven just like completely reading some
*  pass play that had worked a hundred straight times
*  and some cornerbacks like I'm going to bait him
*  and then grab it.
*  I couldn't believe he did it.
*  I was that was the most shocking moment of the game
*  for me other than the 19 Edwards place.
*  It's so hard because.
*  You're sitting there and you're going all right.
*  I want to come help on the best player in the world.
*  Cat needs my help.
*  I got to do it, but I've got to still pay attention
*  to Gordon.
*  So I'm sure it's been broken up a few times this year.
*  I don't remember seeing that.
*  I don't think it's the only time I just I personally
*  don't remember seeing it.
*  What would you do if you're Denver?
*  Well, what would you do with Edwards?
*  Because I don't think Caldwell Pope.
*  I don't know if he's the guy.
*  If Edwards is feeling it.
*  I think you need a different option.
*  I think you start with Pope, but.
*  It feels like that's got to be Gordon and what one
*  of the things I was crazy about yesterday was Edwards
*  was making mincemeat out of those guys like he like
*  borderline ankle breaking shit on multiple Denver dudes
*  and just getting whatever shot he wanted.
*  But I think I think Gordon is probably the answer
*  then it stops right.
*  I might not use Gordon in the first quarter on him
*  and hope that right.
*  I'm saying late, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sure Malone will go to it if he feels like it's
*  going to be this bad.
*  I do think there's a pride thing that we over always
*  overlook and that if you're Pope and you're watching
*  a film of this stuff, you're going all right, like
*  yeah, I'm at this now.
*  Now it's on right.
*  I have to step my effort up, you know, Peyton Watson
*  to go out there and lose his mind, but he's just
*  not stout enough for Ant because Ant is quicker
*  than everybody, but he's also stronger than everybody
*  on these perimeter plays.
*  It's you know, like it's like I'm not saying it's
*  Lucas strength, but imagine like if Luca was also
*  first step quicker than everybody.
*  Yeah, and it doesn't matter.
*  Luca doesn't need to be quicker than he is now
*  because it works all the time.
*  So I think there'll be some pride from from Denver
*  defensively and but even if you were saying, hey,
*  you just gonna send more help or do all these
*  different things when he hit that crossover pull
*  up to the right side as a youth, there's no scheming
*  against that.
*  Yeah, that's that's a wrap.
*  One thing Denver could do I think is when they're
*  bringing the ball up have Yocage running up near
*  Chris Finch throw the ball over his head and just
*  have him crash into Chris Finch again.
*  Maybe they just need to take out Chris Finch one
*  more time.
*  Who's the biggest guy they could said crashing into
*  Chris Finch.
*  I felt bad for that dude man sitting on the but
*  he was there.
*  I mean he was he he just can't get up like there
*  had to have been three times when he wanted to
*  yell at a ref, right?
*  Yeah, I mean, he should give him like a bullhorn
*  like did you hear Barkley like he hadn't looked
*  at the Denver roster really in depth perhaps all
*  year.
*  Oh God, and then obviously if you if you've never
*  watched it before you're going wait a minute Denver
*  only has one big guy that they play right never
*  going to play somebody else and then they're like
*  wait Deandre Jordans on the team.
*  Yeah, Dirk was calling for Deandre.
*  I think at some point Barkley said Zeke Naji.
*  He's like he's 6'9".
*  He just just looked at the Heights on the roster
*  then goes like all right.
*  Well, he's he's 6'9".
*  He might be your Finch guy is what I'm saying.
*  Oh you Zeke Naji.
*  I like it.
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  So it's really hard to repeat.
*  It's really hard to have everything go right for
*  two straight seasons regular season playoffs and
*  I go back to it's it's so funny that this is
*  playing out this way now that going back to that
*  Friday night a game we watched the Wembee game
*  when he scored 17 points in three minutes when
*  Devontae Graham who nobody knew was still in the
*  league made a couple big shots in that last minute
*  and it swung the seeds and Denver went from they
*  could have been the one seed.
*  They could have played New Orleans with no Zion in
*  round one.
*  They'd be playing Dallas in round two a team that
*  I think they'd much rather see than this Minnesota
*  team and that one night might have shifted and we
*  said it on the podcast that Sunday like wouldn't it
*  be weird if it was one of those years where this
*  random stupid game with these players that will
*  never think of again from this season swung the
*  playoffs but it's in play.
*  I definitely would have picked him in the opener.
*  I would have picked him against Dallas and who
*  knows me could OKC just have so much offense and
*  with all their switchable wings on defense with
*  they would they not get manhandled would it be
*  one of those weird bass like three out of the seven
*  games the Chet thing wasn't a problem or four out
*  of the seven.
*  It wasn't a problem and you know whatever game seven
*  anything could happen.
*  But the fact that Denver Minnesota they're playing
*  in a second round match.
*  This happens like what like three times to four
*  times a decade where we just get this and like it
*  happened that one year with Golden State Houston I
*  think 2019 maybe when it was the two best teams
*  and that was second round.
*  It was second round.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes it happens and it's weird.
*  I want to say about KC for Dallas for round two.
*  We're going to end the we're in the YouTube stream.
*  We're going to end part one of the BS podcast.
*  We're going to thank Kyle Creighton and Steve
*  Saruti for producing unless Saruti I don't think
*  Saruti YouTube capable for this or not.
*  I forgot to bring him in and talk about Orlando.
*  Is he oh he is all right.
*  Well before we go we'll we'll get some oh we can't
*  bring Saruti in or we can't.
*  Oh, I'm so let's kill time for a second.
*  We worried about Saruti at all during game seven.
*  No, I know he's not thrilled.
*  I know he's not having a good time, but that's
*  what I said at the beginning if they'd won this
*  series and lost the second round the same.
*  It's the same questions.
*  So it would have been more fun.
*  You're get to be a fan for a couple more weeks,
*  but I don't I don't think the how long the journey
*  went told you a dramatically different version
*  of what this team is with their limitations
*  offensively like this is who they've been all
*  year long.
*  We have Saruti.
*  Oh 30 more seconds.
*  We have to kill more time or so though.
*  What was the illness last night?
*  I thought I thought he had the same pace Minnesota's
*  defense had.
*  It's just it's just marveling watching that dude
*  work the room at a specific speed and not let up
*  for what was it 45 minutes.
*  It was awesome.
*  This is one of the best stand-up comics I've seen
*  in person.
*  Yeah, I think he's the best right now.
*  I'm not saying he's he's the greatest and Timmer
*  Timmer, Bill Burr and Chappelle are probably in
*  the three of the final four.
*  Yeah, I mean I didn't I didn't love the Trump and
*  Tucker Carlson stuff, but I thought the rest of it
*  was pretty funny.
*  Though
*  oh we have Saruti in the frame.
*  Okay, frame him up.
*  See how this goes.
*  You guys framing it.
*  Yeah.
*  All right, Saruti give it you have two minutes.
*  Tell us walk us through your feelings.
*  It just sucks that we had to go up 18, you know,
*  like it's just I was accepting of losing that
*  game.
*  Anybody who asked me before the game.
*  I was like, I don't know.
*  We'll probably lose man.
*  This is one of those series where every home team
*  is going to win and then you go up 18 you get
*  your hopes up and then the end of the second
*  quarter just suck because this suit Kevin Clark
*  and I were texting about it because we're like
*  cool.
*  It was 18 now.
*  It's 10 and they're going to go on like a 6-0 run
*  in the first quarter or the third quarter and
*  then it's going to be a ball game again.
*  And I just I don't have confidence in our offense
*  and that's exactly what happened.
*  Well, I had a chance to hedge at halftime because
*  I had an Orlando series bet.
*  I like plus 160 for the series and they're up 10
*  and halftime and it was the easiest hedge possible
*  to just take Cleveland and the points and I'm
*  with you that the end of the first half looked
*  a little dicey, but I still thought they were
*  going to win.
*  I don't know why I felt I was like I owe their
*  defense and and Garland looks like crap and and
*  I should I should have known he kind of shot your
*  wad in that first 15 minutes.
*  Yeah, I mean the control that Apollo had in the
*  first, you know, yeah quarter and a half was for
*  a guy in his second year in his first game seven
*  his first playoff series of his life.
*  It's stupid how good he is and I don't want to
*  hear about the efficiency.
*  I don't want to hear about the shot selection.
*  We still touched on earlier.
*  He has to do things that are so bad and dumb
*  because he doesn't have he had nothing else going
*  for him.
*  So yeah, when he takes those like, you know,
*  15 foot fadeaway jumpers that go in a decent
*  amount of the time with you know, comparatively,
*  you know to other guys in the league.
*  I'm not even that mad at it.
*  It just the France question is going to be weird
*  question.
*  I still have faith in him.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe he can't be a two.
*  Maybe he can he shot well every single year of his
*  career and this is the first year he hasn't shot.
*  Well, he's improved up.
*  But the thing is he's improved everywhere else.
*  He's improved in his two-point shot.
*  He's improved rebounds assist everything else except
*  for the three-point shooting.
*  So you are yeah, so are you going to say that he's
*  just like incapable of being a player?
*  I would say no.
*  I think the overreaction of summer is going to be
*  nuts, but he's going to have to play in the Olympics
*  again.
*  So he's not going to get a summer off.
*  Lock him in the gym.
*  Rossella, where does Mo Wagner rank on best?
*  I just committed a hard foul and now I'm going to
*  shit talk the guy a little bit, but he's not going
*  to be a technical is anyone better in the league
*  than him right now.
*  He's up there when they had that jump ball when
*  everybody was freaking out.
*  Then he got he felt left out.
*  So then he just started crushing Laverte.
*  Yeah, like he had Laverte.
*  It's the first time I'd ever seen a guy try to tell
*  the other guy he couldn't be in the jump circle.
*  Yeah, I was thinking he's like those those guys and
*  pick up who the sorry dude guys who they elbow
*  somebody in the head or they whatever.
*  They push you for us.
*  Sorry, dude.
*  He's a sorry dude guy just in the actual NBA.
*  Yeah, he does something shitty and he says a huge
*  smile on his face.
*  Yeah, he just has a punch.
*  I love him, but he's like the guy who yeah.
*  Oh my bad, dude.
*  Oh, yeah, I love him.
*  But he's I mean, I totally understand what he'd be
*  right after the game.
*  He's always like, so you oh no, you guys you're
*  in accounting, huh?
*  You guys doing mostly like he wants to like be
*  friendly with you after he just just beat the shit
*  out of you and you're like, I don't I don't want
*  to talk to you for real now.
*  Yeah, I have a torn labrum.
*  Can you leave me alone?
*  Yeah.
*  Do that.
*  Are there more Wagner Brothers or is it just him?
*  I think that's it.
*  I don't know the world to handle more Wagner Brothers,
*  but yeah, I think two is probably enough.
*  How did you feel about Jamal Mosley breaking down
*  the 10-man rotation and bearing Jonathan Isaac?
*  My only explanation would be I don't have an
*  explanation for the Isaac thing.
*  My only explanation for the 10-man rotation is
*  he's just kind of grass and for straws seeing if
*  anybody can kind of step up here.
*  And I mean, I have an explanation.
*  He made one shot per 20 minutes the last three
*  games.
*  Okay, it's not great.
*  That's fair.
*  Yeah, tough for the modern-day Bill Russell.
*  I get it.
*  He shot it way better than I thought he was going
*  to especially in the playoffs.
*  Like sometimes he's the piece of big.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  Yes guy from three and if he could, you know, he
*  was hitting from from the corners, but he almost
*  kind of had like a weird green light where I'm
*  like, ah, you're kind of feeling yourself too much
*  offensively here my man, but I don't I feel like
*  their roster problems are fixable like at us like
*  we need a Max Drew's that's what we need.
*  I don't know who that guy is.
*  But if we had Max Drew's I would feel incredible
*  going into a series like this.
*  Judd Howard.
*  Hey, didn't you forget in our camp?
*  It was a good and good hour again.
*  Isaac said no, no.
*  Yes guy.
*  And he's also a no guy, but that's enough with
*  other stuff.
*  Yep.
*  Can we have your summer wish list?
*  Let's hear it.
*  Let's hear it once and for all give us gold medal
*  silver medal and bronze medal for your summer
*  wish list.
*  What do you what's gold medal?
*  I mean, I texted you and calves and said what you
*  know, how many who do you say no for in the Booker
*  slash Donovan Mitchell situation?
*  Like would you put Franz on that deal?
*  I wouldn't put Suggs in a deal because I just I
*  think I think you're right.
*  Something was off with him.
*  I have no worries about Suggs in a playoff series
*  going forward at all.
*  You wouldn't put Suggs in a Booker deal.
*  Well, no, I
*  if would you do Franz and Suggs like is that
*  in picks?
*  Yeah, this Rudy.
*  What do you do?
*  Are we at the magic?
*  I don't know.
*  I'd really not like to I'd put Franz in the deal.
*  It's not even realistic.
*  So I hate how I'm talking about this and now everyone's
*  going to get mad at me.
*  But no, I mean Booker would be great.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  I'm kind of talked myself out of the Paul George thing.
*  I don't think it fits.
*  It's like another kind of similar wing.
*  I think throw the throw the bag at Malik Monk.
*  That's a great call.
*  What's the deal with Donovan Mitchell and otherwise?
*  I think it's just adding shooting like can you just
*  get guys like could you just get add like two Max
*  truces wherever those guys are.
*  I think they'll be okay and a point guard.
*  We need a point guard for sure.
*  What's the maximum offer for Malik Monk for you?
*  I don't think there is a maximum offer whatever it
*  takes to get it done.
*  So you do like the money three for 110 from Malik Monk.
*  You sure because who else do you sign?
*  You're not signing any other free agents, you know,
*  all you got to do is pay your own guys.
*  I think I agree with Saruti because remember when
*  Van Vleet did it Rossello when they did that deal
*  and we were like Jesus, but you know what like it's
*  good to have Fred Van Vleet on your team.
*  Like we do the ringer hundred and he's like the
*  65th best player in the league.
*  It's like, all right, we had the money.
*  He feels like a plug-and-play guy.
*  He's exactly what they need.
*  A secondary ball hander can knock down some shots
*  doesn't have as as you guys talked about doesn't
*  have to take shots away from Paulo.
*  Like he's the perfect guy.
*  Yeah, the Houston lesson last summer for me was
*  that I don't know if I'm going to get mad about
*  any free agent contracts with all these teams that
*  are bad that have all this cap space and look Orlando
*  is good.
*  They're not bad.
*  It would have been awesome if Van Vleet shot it
*  better for them.
*  But when we saw those contrasts like what are you
*  guys doing and then all he was given the Dreymon
*  deal and by the way all that all this cap stuff is
*  coming up but oh I take clay to by the way speaking
*  and the warriors.
*  Yeah voting on the ringer top hundred really like
*  changed my perspective on this stuff because it
*  makes you realize like in a 30-team league how few
*  impactful guys there are, you know, it's just you
*  getting into the 80s and you're trying to talk
*  yourself into you know, a manual quickly is he number
*  94 and you're like man, what I this is crazy.
*  I can't get to a hundred.
*  So yeah, I think it's worth it.
*  All right, so Rudy you seem like you're in decent
*  spirits.
*  Yeah, I'm all right.
*  We'll be good that the word it's not the other if
*  you told me that we would have lost in seven games
*  like this, you know before the season started I'd
*  snatch your hand off for that.
*  This is a great season for them.
*  I'm happy.
*  It's all right.
*  Well, I'm glad Mo Wagner.
*  I feel like he would have injured one of the Celtics
*  on probably were at the best for me.
*  Probably better out playing Cleveland.
*  All right.
*  We're wrapping up part one of YouTube stream.
*  Thanks to us.
*  Rudy.
*  Thanks Kyle Crane.
*  Thanks to Rossello.
*  We are going to put this podcast up immediately
*  then part two, which we're going to tape right now
*  not on YouTube is going to go up at midnight tonight
*  East Coast.
*  Thanks for watching and listening.
