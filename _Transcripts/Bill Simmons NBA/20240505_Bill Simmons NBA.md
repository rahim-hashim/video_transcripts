# Nuggets vs. Timberwolves is the Series We've Been Waiting For | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr1gS4jSQlk)
*  Where do you want to start with Minnesota Denver? I'll let you lead.
*  Cause I know like that, that level of basketball yesterday was,
*  and I saw you last night cause we went to go see Shane Gillis, but, uh,
*  we were both on a high after game one, Minnesota, Denver, just, uh,
*  about as good of a playoff basketball game one as you're going to get in a
*  series.
*  Yeah. I almost said no to Gillis just because I was like, do I,
*  can I emotionally pivot that quickly after like I was kind of thinking about
*  where I would be during the day? And I was like, well, this,
*  I cannot believe this is a second round series. I can't believe we're this lucky.
*  Uh, I think I would start with the defense,
*  kind of like what we talked about there a little bit in the beginning.
*  And it's a lot of like more Phoenix is like, are you serious?
*  Like Booker with Jamie McDaniels going like our weight, like this,
*  this is the whole game. This is what we're going to do.
*  Like I'm not even at half court yet and I'm worried about getting it over.
*  And you saw that with Murray and Murray had another slow start, although,
*  you know, that wasn't the biggest problem when they were up 18 four. I'm like,
*  okay, well Denver isn't going to get it run off the floor.
*  And that wasn't the case. And the cat stretch,
*  the Nas stretch, like there was a lot of really good things in there.
*  I think the alarming thing if you were Denver and you watch the film from it is
*  you're like, man, they got good looks the whole time.
*  And Denver did not know Denver worked really hard. Hey,
*  my biggest fear for Denver in this series and I,
*  I'm rooting for Denver cause I, cause I just like Yoke edge and I like Denver.
*  And I like when teams try to go back to back. Um,
*  but I'm also rooting for Minnesota cause I have a pretty large Celtics,
*  Timberlake of spinal sped at 16 to one. So I was kind of like back and forth,
*  couldn't decide where I was going. Um,
*  but the thing that alarmed me for Denver was I was like, man,
*  I'm rooting for Denver.
*  There's a recipe where they're just throwing these big guys at Yoke edge and
*  they're just making him work the whole game.
*  And it's just two and a half hours of just not fun to be Yoke edge in this
*  game. There's that.
*  But then there's like the McDaniels Edwards,
*  just them taking turns on Murray and just making his life miserable.
*  And if those two things are happening simultaneously,
*  what else is going on for Denver?
*  And that entire game one was just if Minnesota was going to play defense like
*  this and then they're getting the ant piece on the other end and he's going to
*  be able to rise to that level offensively, Denver can't beat them.
*  The question is, can you do that again?
*  Is that who he is or did he have a really good game?
*  Because if he's there or close Minnesota is going to win the series.
*  I picked Minnesota.
*  It was a coin toss for me cause I didn't really like picking against Denver,
*  especially him having the home court.
*  And when the go bear towns things works,
*  it's go bear just swallowing up Gordon.
*  And then he's left to roam off of Gordon because if Gordon tries to stretch the
*  floor by sitting in the corners, the go bears is not going to pay attention to
*  him. Yeah.
*  But then you have the towns foul piece where,
*  I mean you had a tweet on this the other week and I don't know that it got enough
*  credit. His foul habits are atrocious.
*  Yeah.
*  He just decides to get these awful.
*  He had two in like a minute when he came back in yesterday, we were like,
*  do you not want to play today?
*  I actually was wondering if, if Mike and Norrie who was in for Finch,
*  but I'm sure it's really Finch's call cause he's sitting there right on the
*  bench. But when Nas was so good, I was like,
*  do you actually go back to towns because we talked about this last night,
*  they put towns in with like two minutes left and it was like, we kind of know,
*  why do you think the game, why do you think they did that?
*  Because they didn't want it to be a story after the game that towns was bench
*  for the last seven minutes. There's no other reason.
*  Nas was the second best guy they had in the second half of that game.
*  You're not taking them out. They had to take it out for,
*  you could lose towns potentially if you're just sitting him for the last seven,
*  eight minutes. That was why they did it.
*  I think you're right. So if towns gets in a foul trouble,
*  then I'd think like, okay,
*  so that means Rudy has to play Jokic straight up.
*  And if you look at Jokic when he has just Rudy, he goes right out.
*  He doesn't really have that much fear of him at all.
*  I wouldn't say it's as excited as he gets when Rui was on him in the first round
*  where it was like, Oh my God, Oh my God, you know, give me the ball,
*  give me the ball. I'm actually not going to pass here. He has no concern.
*  Cause I think he always thinks he can get,
*  but the problem is if it's towns and then Rudy helping off a Gordon,
*  I mean 11 to 25 and two from nine from three. I mean,
*  you'll get strict nine threes in that game. Cause he'll also like have moments.
*  There's like, all right, I gotta get going.
*  I didn't start taking tougher shots here.
*  So I don't know that you're going to get that from Jokic again,
*  but left out the Nas is the other piece of this. Yeah.
*  That's the point that I'm getting to is like the towns gets in a foul
*  trouble. You start thinking, Oh, then it's Rudy straight up on him. It's like,
*  well yeah,
*  but they have this Nas piece against a Denver team that doesn't have another
*  big, they feel good about playing.
*  Well, and then the other way they were using Nas and I don't, I listen,
*  this, if I ever get hit by a bus and they're like,
*  what are the things you truly cared about? And list like 12 things.
*  I really want one of them to be,
*  if the other team isn't using their point card to bring up the ball,
*  just pressure them 94 feet. Cause Minnesota went in this game.
*  It's like,
*  if you're just going to bring the ball up, we're going to make them work.
*  Where I like Nas was picking him up at the top of the three point line on the
*  other, on the,
*  on their side of the court and just hounding and pushing them.
*  And I thought they did something. I watch a Tony Yocage.
*  That was the first time I've seen a team speed him up where he,
*  he was playing at a speed that I felt like was 10% faster than maybe he was
*  happy about. And they managed to do it.
*  And they got him where he just,
*  I never felt like he was totally in control of the game. His stats were fine.
*  But in terms of like the typical Yocage Meister thing, now part of it,
*  this is why game two is going to be so interesting.
*  You're coming off a Lakers game where, you know, they, he,
*  they just figured out the Lakers and when they really needed a score on them
*  and the who to attack and who to get into a switch and all that.
*  And he had just figured it out. He controlled the pace.
*  They never pressured him.
*  So he's going to adjust cause he's a genius at basketball, but I'm going to,
*  I, my big thing for game two is can they speed him up like that again?
*  Have you ever seen him? I don't want to say he was frantic,
*  but he just seemed like a little over caffeinated.
*  That's not normally what he's like.
*  I thought there was stuff around the rim where he just wasn't,
*  I expect everything to go in. Okay. So like his touch, it's,
*  it's like he's placing the ball up towards the rim the same way.
*  Comparing him to the greatest players ever.
*  So I'm not worried about him at all,
*  but I would agree there were certain things throughout the course of the day.
*  We were like, Oh, that feels a little non-yoke-ish-y.
*  And Porter continues to have these stretches when the offense around him
*  doesn't really have much going on. I mean, he had some stretches during LA,
*  where you're like, that was kind of the game. Murray, he was six of 14.
*  His shooting numbers from three were fine. He was only two or four,
*  but he was below 30% against the Lakers.
*  So I don't know how much of the calf thing is there.
*  Did you, what can I do? My percentages on him? Yeah, I love it.
*  81 74 84. That seems high.
*  It felt like 84% healthy to me,
*  but they were clearly trying to put miles on him that whole game.
*  They were like, let's this guy's watch McDaniel's let's go, let's go, let's go.
*  McDaniel's had some early opportunities offensively where you're like,
*  all right, that's a maker. You know, they're turning the ball over. And I'm like,
*  this score should be bigger.
*  Like they should have a bigger lead than they have right now because still some
*  of these looks are really good.
*  And then you have the ant thing that I can't believe we took this long to get to
*  because it's so much fun. The shot making is absurd,
*  but Pope provides zero resistance to him at all. Like it's not even close.
*  When he has pulled one on one,
*  it's so much bigger than him. Yeah. It's there's like,
*  I don't know how that's solved unless it's an effort thing,
*  but Pope who we like defensively. And you think, Hey,
*  that's a nice little option to have out there.
*  No, he's a borderline elite defender, I would say.
*  And he was just getting demolished.
*  Demolished. Do you know that? Did you read the back story on those guys?
*  Uh, with the Georgia background? Yeah. And like,
*  like Pope's known him for a while and it's like a big brother to Ant and it's
*  like, he's my big brother, but I'm going to fucking destroy him.
*  The series like Ant talks the best shit of anyone I think we've had in a while.
*  Um, I want to get to some man stuff in a second, but what's,
*  big picture for the series.
*  Denver was a minus two Oh five favorite heading into game one.
*  Denver is now a plus one Oh eight favorite.
*  We're still a Denver and seven was plus four 10 24 hours ago.
*  Now it's plus three 50.
*  A Minnesota sweep is down to plus five 50. And the reason I bring this up,
*  I know you just made a face. I well, come on, you know, like,
*  no, don't give me the, come on. I'm just going to, I'm not saying it to you,
*  but I just want to talk it out for a split second. It's just,
*  it's so disrespectful to even ask this. Go ahead.
*  This is, this is why it's going to be good content.
*  I was thinking cause I'm going to do a whole thing about the history of Ant and
*  some of the, the pool that he's swimming in right now,
*  this T Wolf's team,
*  a little similar where this team has the look and I don't know if it's legitimate
*  or not,
*  but we've seen it a couple of times in the history of the league where it was
*  like the bulls against the pistons in 91.
*  You're like, man, they really kind of kicked their ass in game one.
*  What did that mean? Ah, the pistons will come back and it's like, ah,
*  they're down Oh two. Well, they're going back to Detroit. It'll be fine. Oh shit.
*  Are they going to lose game three? And then all of a sudden it's a sweep, right?
*  Same thing with a Pistons Lakers, which wasn't a sweep in Oh four, where,
*  you know,
*  I think the Lakers won game one or game two and then it went to Detroit and it's
*  like, ah, the Lakers will steal game four. And it's like,
*  Oh, they're getting their asses kicked. Oh,
*  this series over cause the Oh four pistons had the look.
*  And the other one I was thinking was the 14 spurs when they split the series,
*  the first two with Miami and it went back to Miami and then they killed them in
*  game three and people are like, Oh, Miami lock it down.
*  They're going to win tonight. And I remember going on TV being like,
*  I think there's a chance like San Antonio might've figured this out.
*  And like the series, this, this, like the Miami is in real trouble here.
*  And Miami remember they were down 20 points in every one of those games.
*  This might just be,
*  this might just be a great spot for Minnesota is my point.
*  There are historical examples of a team coming off like a long title run and
*  just running into the wrong buzzsaw at the wrong time.
*  That's a wrong matchup for them and they're a little banged up.
*  And I would be afraid of that if I was a Denver fan,
*  I'm still picking Denver to win in seven, but to me,
*  every possibility is on the board now.
*  2012 thunder Lakers is one I thought of.
*  Well, that's a good one. Yeah. Cause I was like, wait, these guys are like,
*  given it to them. They're not even remotely afraid of them at all. Right.
*  Like this isn't supposed to happen this soon.
*  And that group ends up making it to the finals.
*  They lost the first two to San Antonio, San Antonio, when I was like, okay,
*  well, you know, they're just not going to be ready enough to beat them.
*  And then they won four straight where all the things I liked about San Antonio,
*  the athleticism of the Thunderbird, just overwhelming as that series.
*  That's a good, that's a really good example. Thank you for helping my theory.
*  So I just don't like it. I just, I just, it was the first game, you know,
*  Minnesota hasn't lost a playoff game yet. So I would imagine the vibes.
*  That's another thing that ties into that theory. Like the bull, the 91 bulls,
*  I think they lost two games and like one of them was in overtime.
*  They, if, I mean, the bigger thing is if ants going to look like that,
*  they're going to win the series. And I was trying, I went back,
*  it did a little homework. I went back, you know,
*  he scored 36 in his first playoff game ever.
*  MJ scored 30 plus in his second playoff game ever.
*  Kobe it wasn't until his 30th playoff game. He was younger, Wade 14th playoff game.
*  He scored 41 in his eighth playoff game ever, which is better than everyone.
*  But MJ his last three games,
*  39.7 points for three games stretch. She's 22 years old.
*  And you go back MJ, his three Boston games, he was 23,
*  43.7 Kobe.
*  When he had that 48 pointer against Sacramento,
*  which is like one of the great YouTube games. That's like,
*  wait, if you're going to make the case for the 2001 Lakers is the best team of
*  all time. Like the game for the Sacramento and I was like, Oh,
*  and Shaq was also on this team. But he had three in a row and he averaged 43 a
*  game. And Wade was another one where he, you know,
*  he had little stretches like that Jerry West,
*  but like the stuff ants doing right now, historically
*  it's a different level. It's not just, Oh my God, Oh, he, yeah, he looks like MJ.
*  It's like he's doing stuff that the greatest two guards of all time we're doing
*  at this point of their careers when it seemed, it seemed early, but it wasn't.
*  And that's what that to me,
*  the ceiling is now even higher because of just what his last three games looked
*  like. The stuff he was doing yesterday to Caldwell Pope was like,
*  kind of post baseball MJ stuff and late 2000s,
*  Kobe stuff and mid 2000s Wade stuff.
*  Like some sort of combination of all of that were like the young athletes stuff,
*  but also like this wherewithal of how to back somebody down,
*  shoot these beautiful turnarounds. It's fucking crazy.
*  Like for a 22 year old do that is fucking crazy.
*  And if I'm Denver, I'm terrified right now.
*  Yeah, that might just be the part of like all of this where when I was trying to
*  figure out, you know,
*  and I changed my mind a bunch leading up to game one.
*  And even though game one played out the way it does,
*  I'm like sitting here like victory laughing, like, all right, yep.
*  I picked the timber wolves like, cause I knew it.
*  But yeah, whenever I think about all the different things that could or couldn't
*  happen in a series, like I can't get past the fact of like,
*  maybe ant is just as special. I mean, we obviously love them. We've talked them up.
*  It's usually not how this works.
*  There was a number that Goldsberry had the other day players that have scored
*  35 plus in three straight playoff games at 22 or younger. It's Kareem,
*  Kobe, LeBron and ant. Like,
*  what if this is just the beginning and like he gets one of these early,
*  they get out of the West, like he might just be that good.
*  And that might be the simple reason, you know, instead of like, okay,
*  well it means that they had, you know,
*  look all these other parts of it are certainly important if they're going to
*  knock off a team as good as Denver. But there's,
*  there's always like, I'll spend all this time looking at it. Like, Hey,
*  maybe just ant is that sick. Maybe he's just, it doesn't matter.
*  Shout out to basketball reference. I looked up on stat head 23 and under,
*  28 points or more, 45% field goal or more,
*  and just who's on the list. And it's like all the greatest players, you know,
*  it's Durant's 2012, which by the way, it was incredible that season,
*  which you mentioned earlier, it's Kobe in 2001.
*  It's Luke in 22. It's Jerry West at 1962,
*  Kareem's first year, Bob McAdoo. It just goes on and on.
*  And ant has two because last year he did it too. Um,
*  he's just Michael Jordan, Oscar, like this is a different
*  pool he's swimming in to use the pool analogy again. But, um,
*  and the shot looking this good, this early, I mean,
*  he was under 30% from three from college. The team wasn't any good.
*  So you couldn't, I had a hard time with it with him where I was like,
*  is he taking bad shots,
*  which is part of it. Like the team wasn't very good,
*  but there was just a lot of bad decisions. He's really raw. He's a super athlete.
*  He's got the ball a ton and you're on like, all right, well, you know,
*  is he going to turn to this? And then he just physically,
*  pretty quickly you would watch him in the NBA. Like now he's next to NBA guys.
*  You're like,
*  that guy looks like the most impressive person out there of the 10 guys running
*  around.
*  So athletically easy for him sometimes. So play when he went full court lefty.
*  Yeah. In the fourth quarter when it seemed like they wanted a foul,
*  but they weren't sure. And aunt just went 94 feet left-handed for a layup.
*  And it just looked like he was a high school or an eighth grade basketball game.
*  Like think about what he's shown now is that he can,
*  he can drive at his size and get to the hoop.
*  And then once he's at the rim against traffic,
*  he figures out a way with like a little nobody's Kyrie's finishing package,
*  but there's certain things with him where you're like, is he closed off?
*  Does he have an angle? Yeah, he has an angle.
*  He brought it up and under on this one or he finished left hand on this one.
*  I say, okay, so no one can really stay in front of them.
*  If you stay even with him, he's probably going to be more physical than you.
*  He's going to be quicker. He's going to be stronger. And then he has all the,
*  this, all of these things that he can do. He can shoot threes.
*  His playmaking this year is incredible.
*  And now if he wants to slow it down in a playoff game and he gets like the
*  spacing he wants, like he had a play where Jokic was waiting for him in the
*  paint and he may have had reggie. It might not have been Pope on this one,
*  but you could see the whole time he was trying to find a way to either bring
*  Jokic further out to him for a pass, or if Jokic didn't come completely out to him,
*  he was going to turn to his right shoulder and shoot it on the left side.
*  And like he was seeing it all happen and you could see the play was just slow.
*  So it wasn't hard to figure out what he was doing,
*  but he was waiting for like the perfect positioning of where the defense was at
*  was like, well, if Jokic stays where he is now,
*  like I don't have a passing lane, so that means a shot's going to be on me.
*  It's a little late in the shot clock. Let me turn and go this way. On top of that.
*  Then he plays awesome defense. So there's awesome defense.
*  There's nothing about him where you're like,
*  we're getting a 27 28 year old package for a guy who's 22 years old.
*  And that's not supposed to happen.
*  I was looking back cause I remembered his rookie year.
*  There was a game and you and I had both just randomly watched it and we were
*  texting each other. It was like, did you see that? Cause I went back.
*  I looked at his game log. He was bad for the first two months. Like really,
*  you know, that was the coming out of the COVID season, but his stats are bad.
*  And then there's this game.
*  I'm going to say it's like two thirds of the season against Phoenix.
*  And it was the sons team that went to the finals.
*  And I think this was the game you and I texted about when he had 42 and there
*  was just, it was just something there. And you look at his stats,
*  like he just gets better as that season goes along.
*  And then the last eight games,
*  he's like 27 a game and he's hitting threes and just over the course of the year
*  he jumped. And I,
*  but I remember that Phoenix game being like, there's something unusual about
*  this. And he's since then hit every checkpoint.
*  But then you look at this season,
*  I feel like he's hit checkpoints during this season, even from like, you know,
*  team USA, the first half of the season to what happened when towns went out,
*  when he had this extra burden and he was able to deliver to now what he's
*  been doing in the playoffs. It just feels like he's jumped four levels since
*  team USA. And those team USA guys immediately were like,
*  this is the best guy on our team. Like we,
*  we were wondering if he's going to get minutes and this is like,
*  he's the leader of our team.
*  The other thing I love about him and it really reminds me of early LeBron,
*  cause I thought LeBron was like an unbelievable teammate on those early
*  Cleveland teams, like the 07, 08, 09. He just was,
*  he was so much fun to see in person. He was so happy. He was so inclusive,
*  like he was just awesome to watch. And Ant has that same quality,
*  I think where it's just,
*  he's just the hub of all the activity and the energy and those guys fucking love
*  him. Like they just are completely in on him.
*  For, for a cat to be miked up. And at that one moment in the game,
*  they re-aired the miked up stuff and cats going to him,
*  telling him to keep his composure and for Ant not to just laugh hysterically in
*  cat's face.
*  I was like, I might vote him for MVP this year, but think about who we're talking
*  about. Cause do you, all right, let me ask it this way.
*  Cause I've already kind of alluded to it. Do you have moments where you're like,
*  maybe he is this special that he's going to win this whole thing now?
*  Yeah, I thought of it yesterday.
*  I watched the second app with Tate and we talked about it and I was just like,
*  Tate George, Tate George, uh, Tate Frazier, the ringer's own. Um,
*  we, uh, sometimes it happens sooner than you're ready,
*  sooner than you think.
*  And that's one of the great things about all of these guys where we're,
*  we're surprised by the age, but that's really not a good reason to be surprised.
*  You know, like tiger, it's like, Oh, tiger, it's going to be so much fun to watch
*  him. I'm not comparing with tiger, but when tiger came in, Oh,
*  it'll be so cool if he can compete for a major.
*  And then he fucking won the masters right away. You know, uh,
*  this is just how it goes. Sometimes guys just come in and they're fucking awesome.
*  Like Gretzky came into the NHL is like, I'm going to take every record.
*  I don't think he's Gretzky, but there, there are people that have come in.
*  LeBron made the finals in 2007 with like a fucking G league team,
*  you know, like it, I look,
*  I still think that's one of LeBron's greatest accomplishments of his entire
*  2011 and 12 that like he took that team to finals.
*  He was slaying dragons every round. We were like, okay, I guess,
*  I guess they're ready. So, you know,
*  it's the history of this sport that sometimes guys are early instead of late.
*  Um, Wade, I felt like Wade in 05, I think it would have happened, but he got hurt.
*  Remember that. And then it did happen the next year, but I thought that 05,
*  um, I thought he was ready to take the title that year.
*  And it was his second year in the league and it would have been crazy,
*  but it was like, all right, I guess this is happening. Um, so I think it's a good one.
*  Wade's a good one. Cause we're usually don't get the early,
*  but then I was thinking about, and I'm like, okay,
*  so he's not going to make first team all NBA if in beat had been healthy,
*  like in beat MVP, in beat, you know,
*  and beat might have won another one. Uh, it's like, yeah,
*  and finished seventh. Like, I don't know where Ant's going to finish.
*  He's not going to finish to the top type, uh, top five MVP voting.
*  And yet I'll have moments. And it's not just because they won game one.
*  And I'm not going to be shocked if Denver comes back and Jokic figure some things
*  out and they're terrific. And you know,
*  maybe they have to get a little creative with what they want to do with Ant.
*  And then if Ant gets bottled up,
*  then all of a sudden nobody else is making shots for two quarters straight from
*  Minnesota. Like I'm not going to be shocked to see some of that kind of stuff
*  happen, but it would be really just beyond unique of Ant arrives.
*  Minnesota wins a championship. Like it's not supposed to happen this way.
*  And then all the postseason stuff comes in and you go,
*  he wasn't even top five in MVP. And then next year he's going to be the favorite.
*  If the things were to happen, I don't know.
*  Yeah. If it was a title, first of all, if he beats Denver and makes the finals,
*  he becomes the biggest under 30 star in the league. Like that's just like market
*  down and he might be getting clay. May even beating Denver might do that. He's,
*  he's leaving Tatum, all those guys in the dust. Cause he's just different.
*  He's got a charisma to him that casual people, casual fans can see.
*  Plus he delivers over and over again. Plus he's so fucking fun to watch.
*  There's a world where they just win the title and he goes to team USA and you
*  have like, Oh, it's going to be LeBron and Steph and Katie's team.
*  How are those guys going to deal with that? Cause this, I mean, now we're,
*  I almost feel like I'm going to get hit by lightning,
*  but the dream team was like that in 92 or it was like, Oh,
*  this is going to be the bird and magic. And this is going to be the,
*  and then MJ just took it and it became the Michael Jordan dream team
*  featuring Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and all these other guys.
*  It's going to be fascinating if he actually wins the title to watch how then
*  that transpires to the dream team and LeBron being like, I always knew,
*  I knew from the get-go, this was going to happen, Fran. I've been telling him,
*  so here's the, here's the, like, did you didn't have him? Obviously,
*  we all agreed on where Yokech is. No one had him ahead of Luca. Um,
*  I don't think anybody had him. Well, cause he wasn't SGA.
*  SGA had the better year.
*  He wasn't ahead of SGA this year,
*  but in the playoffs he's averaging 33 a game and he's fucking demolishing teams.
*  He demolished Phoenix. Like he broke them, broke them.
*  And that Denver game was the first time we've seen Denver.
*  The game was tied with seven minutes left and they got out executed and a team
*  had a different energy. But you know,
*  I've been watching hoops long enough that sometimes you can see when a team has
*  the look and I do think Minnesota has the look. I just don't know if Edward,
*  it's going to depend on whether Edwards is ready or not to really just start
*  slaying dragons now.
*  But he did it against Phoenix and he did it in game one against Denver.
*  And if I'm Denver and I'm thinking, man,
*  they have all this shit to throw at Yocage. It's going to be really hard for him.
*  They have all the shit to throw at Murray. It's going to be really hard on him.
*  Oh, and we don't really have anybody to stop Edwards if he's feeling it.
*  That becomes pretty hard series. They have a game seven in Denver.
*  They have the pedigree.
*  We've never seen it in the situation where now this is really sitting there.
*  Is he going to want it too bad?
*  Like there's just levels to this that we've just haven't seen him in the
*  situation yet, but it's, it checks a lot of boxes, man.
*  Yeah. And we haven't even mentioned the other side of it,
*  of like how good Dallas looks now and how great OKC looks in the first round too.
*  So like even if he gets through this, it's assuming a lot, but yeah, whatever.
*  I think it's kind of fun.
*  How funny would it like, let's say Minnesota beats Denver and OKC beats Dallas.
*  And now we end up with Minnesota. OKC, Edwards versus SGA,
*  Jaylen Williams guarding Edwards size against no size really at all.
*  Ken Chet pull people away from the basket.
*  That's actually a really great basketball series from a nerd standpoint.
*  And then you have these two guys who are the best, you know, other than Luca,
*  the best under 30 guys. But you know,
*  that it's sitting there now for Edwards and the defensive stuff
*  they were doing in that game.
*  Who else has been on that level in this century?
*  Like the 08 Celtics got there, I feel like.
*  The 04 Pistons team was awesome.
*  All five guys could play any other position.
*  Who else?
*  I think San Antonio has always been really good defensively.
*  I think some of those switchy Golden State teams are really good.
*  I was going to say the lineup of death, I felt like could get there
*  and really just get stops for four or five minutes in a row.
*  I just imagine if you're another really good player, whether it's Booker or Murray,
*  they're just I know I've already said it, but you're going like, wait,
*  what? Like this is and just like, OK,
*  can we just get a screen up here with a guard just so I can get an angle
*  to get the ball half court and get it set up?
*  It's like now ants on me.
*  And now now Alexander Walker is on me.
*  Again, he steps up defensively and then you're like, OK,
*  finally got past these guys.
*  We what? Yeah, it's.
*  It's more bear dead in that game yesterday that I've never seen in all the times.
*  The two on one retreat thing on the Gordon pass from Jokic.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  Have you ever seen anyone do that to Jokic before?
*  He was the first guy who guessed it.
*  It was like watching somebody pick off Tom Brady and like oh seven,
*  just like completely reading some pass play that had worked a hundred straight times
*  and some cornerbacks like I'm going to bait him and then grab it.
*  I couldn't believe he did it.
*  I was that was the most shocking moment of the game for me,
*  other than the 19 Edwards place.
*  It's so hard because.
*  You're sitting there and you're going, all right, I want to come help on
*  the best player in the world.
*  Cat needs my help.
*  I got to do it, but I've got to still pay attention to Gordon.
*  So I'm sure it's been broken up a few times this year.
*  I don't remember seeing that.
*  I don't think it's the only time I just I personally don't remember seeing it.
*  What what would you do if you're Denver?
*  Well, what would you do with Edwards?
*  Because I don't think Caldwell Pope.
*  I don't know if he's the guy.
*  If Edwards is feeling it, I think you need a different option.
*  I think you start with Pope, but.
*  It feels like that's got to be Gordon.
*  And one of the things I was crazy about yesterday was Edwards
*  was making mincemeat out of those guys like he like borderline ankle breaking shit
*  on multiple Denver dudes and just getting whatever shot he wanted.
*  But I think I think Gordon is probably the answer.
*  Then it stops, right?
*  I might not use Gordon in the first quarter on him and hope that.
*  Right. I'm saying late.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I'm sure Malone would go to it if he feels like it's going to be this bad.
*  I do think there's a pride thing that we over always overlook
*  and that if you're Pope and you're watching a film of this stuff,
*  you're going, all right, like, yeah, I have this now.
*  Now it's on. Right.
*  I step my effort up.
*  You know, Peyton Watson to go out there and lose his mind.
*  But he's just not stout enough for Ant because Ant is quicker than everybody.
*  But he's also stronger than everybody on these perimeter plays.
*  It's you know, like it's like I'm not saying it's Lucas strength,
*  but imagine like if Luca was also first step quicker than everybody.
*  Yeah. And it doesn't matter.
*  Luca doesn't need to be quicker than he is now because it works all the time.
*  So I think there'll be some pride from from Denver defensively.
*  And but even if you were saying, hey, you just send more help
*  or do all these different things when he hit that crossover,
*  pull up to the right side as a youth, there's no scheming against that.
*  Yeah, that's that's a wrap.
*  One thing Denver can do, I think, is when they're bringing the ball up,
*  have Yocage running up near Chris Finch, throw the ball over his head
*  and just have him crash into Chris Finch again.
*  Maybe they just need to take out Chris Finch one more time.
*  Who's the biggest guy they could send crashing into Chris Finch?
*  I felt bad for that dude, man, sitting on the but he was there.
*  I mean, he was he he just can't get up.
*  Like there had to have been three times when he wanted to yell at a ref, right?
*  Yeah, I mean, he's like a bullhorn.
*  Like, oh, did you hear Barkley?
*  Like he hadn't looked at the Denver roster really in depth, perhaps all year.
*  Oh, God. And then all this, like if you if you've never watched it before,
*  you're going, wait a minute, Denver only has one big guy that they play.
*  They're never going to play somebody else.
*  And then they're like, wait, Deandre Jordan's on the team.
*  Yeah, Dirk was calling for Deandre.
*  I think at some point, Barkley said Zeke Naji, he's like he's six, nine.
*  He just just looked at the heights on the roster and goes like, all right,
*  well, he's he's six, nine.
*  He might be your Finch guy is what I'm saying.
*  Oh, you Zeke Naji. I like it.
*  Well, here's the thing, Rossello.
*  It's really hard to repeat.
*  It's really hard to have everything go right for two straight seasons,
*  regular season playoffs.
*  And I go back to it's
*  it's so funny that this is playing out this way now, that going back to that
*  Friday night, a game we watched.
*  The Wembe game when he scored 17 points in three minutes,
*  when Devontae Graham, who nobody knew was still in the league,
*  made a couple of big shots in that last minute and it swung the seeds.
*  And Denver went from they could have been the one seed.
*  They could have played New Orleans with no Zion around one.
*  They'd be playing Dallas in round two, a team that I think they'd much rather
*  see than this Minnesota team.
*  And that one night might have shifted.
*  And we said it on the podcast that Sunday, like,
*  wouldn't it be weird if it was one of those years where this random,
*  stupid game with these players that we'll never think of again
*  from this season swung the playoffs?
*  But it's in play.
*  I definitely would have picked him in the opener.
*  I would have picked him against Dallas.
*  And who knows?
*  I mean, could OKC just have so much offense
*  and with all their switchable wings on defense, would they
*  would they not get manhandled?
*  Would it be one of those weird bass like three out of the seven games?
*  The Chet thing wasn't a problem or four out of the seven.
*  It wasn't a problem.
*  And, you know, whatever game seven, anything could happen.
*  But the fact that Denver, Minnesota, they're playing in a second round.
*  Match this happens like what, like three times to four times a decade
*  where we just get this like it happened that one year
*  with Golden State Houston, I think 2019, maybe
*  when it was the two best teams and that was second round.
*  It was second round. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Sometimes it happens and it's weird.
