# The Knicks Stay Alive, Indy Looks Creakyâ€¦and OKC Would Smoke Them Both | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk)
*  ["Get safetyAnnke Via [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=28.96s)]
*  Starting the BS podcast here with Rob Mahoney and Joe House. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=33.08s)]
*  Are we sober house? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=38.08s)]
*  Are we buzzed? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=39.08s)]
*  What is Harvey? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=40.08s)]
*  Late night house. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=41.56s)]
*  Late night house. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=42.56s)]
*  Let's see what the cards give us groggy like a little letting it loose house. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=43.56s)]
*  Unlike Andrew Nemhard today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=48.32s)]
*  We're doing this live on YouTube. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=50.88s)]
*  I thought this was going to be an awesome game today and New York had other ideas. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  A couple of the Pacers had other ideas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=57.24s)]
*  Did New York figure anything out today, Mahoney, or did Indiana just suck? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  I think they figured out how to play defense like they had something to lose. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=65.08s)]
*  I think there's games where the next defensive problems are personnel based, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  are schematic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=73.36s)]
*  That's been the case in the series to some extent in this game. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=75.08s)]
*  I didn't think they changed a ton. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  They changed some. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  Mostly they just played with actual intensity, especially on the perimeter to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  the point that it did feel like the Pacers kind of forgot for a while that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=83.16s)]
*  they were allowed to move into the direction of the basket. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=86.76s)]
*  Like it was all side to side. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=89.2s)]
*  It was all handoffs up top. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  Once they, you know, Ben Mathurin came in and decided to cut and they decided to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=92.56s)]
*  drive a little more of the game changed a bit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=96.04s)]
*  But I thought the Knicks perimeter defense pressured them out of a lot of their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=97.64s)]
*  stuff and they deserve a lot of credit for that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  What did you think, House? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=103.4s)]
*  The Knicks did the thing that's most important in basketball, which is make the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=106.04s)]
*  shots. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  They started off by the making of the shots in the first quarter and that had [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  the effect of keeping the Pacers from running. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=114.84s)]
*  So we had two quarters from the Pacers where they scored less than 25 points. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=117.92s)]
*  They scored 45 points in the whole first half. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Twenty three points first quarter, 22 points second quarter, because the Knicks [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  did the making of the baskets. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=129.44s)]
*  Bill Simmons and Indiana stunk. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=131.16s)]
*  Not a good game for them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=135.24s)]
*  It's pretty tough when Ben Mathurin saves you from having like a seventy five point [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=137.4s)]
*  game, which is where we're headed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  And the stats reflect how bad it was, but it was even worse watching it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=144.88s)]
*  Neesmith was one for eight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=149.6s)]
*  You only played 15 minutes by the way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=151.96s)]
*  They seemed like they were limiting him with that ankle probably. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=153.84s)]
*  And that, I mean, Jalen Brunson feasts every minute that Neesmith isn't on the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=157.24s)]
*  floor. Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=160.96s)]
*  And once they kind of realized maybe the game was a little behind them, they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=161.68s)]
*  started a little more careful. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=166.28s)]
*  Nemhard was three for eight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=168.68s)]
*  It felt worse. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=169.88s)]
*  Three turnovers. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=170.96s)]
*  Turner. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=174.08s)]
*  Twenty four minutes, five points, four turnovers and a couple of like really [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=174.32s)]
*  just awkward offensive moments. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=178.8s)]
*  Twenty five feet from the basket where he's like trying to dribble against [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=180.68s)]
*  Mitchell Robinson. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=184.52s)]
*  Like it was one time he just kind of fell out of bounds. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=185.56s)]
*  It was like I thought the biggest thing the Knicks did today other than pressure [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=188.96s)]
*  Halliburton and just make it more difficult for him on defense was they felt [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  like they were attacking Miles Turner Rob. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=196.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=198.52s)]
*  Like, oh, you're going to have the bomb coming at you completely. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=199.16s)]
*  And he's been beating up on their smaller defenders all series against [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=202.36s)]
*  mismatches, and they were swiping really well to kind of dislodge him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  They were fighting for position much more effectively. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=209.08s)]
*  You mentioned like on the perimeter, there's times there's times where [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=211.52s)]
*  Miles Turner looks like a great athlete. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=214.36s)]
*  And then there's times where it looks like one of his legs is like a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  dramatically different length than the other. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=219.12s)]
*  And he can't quite move in a fluid manner. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=220.8s)]
*  They brought that side out of him to the point that like Mitchell Robinson at [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=224.52s)]
*  some points was pressuring Miles Turner up to half court. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=227.68s)]
*  Like they just wouldn't let him move at all, much less get into that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=230.16s)]
*  little handoff game. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=233.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=234.48s)]
*  It the miles Turner free agency tape. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=235.24s)]
*  It's going to have to be a carefully edited 20 minute highlight tape house. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=238.72s)]
*  But I think the 20 minute highlight tape will be excellent. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=242.28s)]
*  It can't have anything to do with Carl Anthony towns. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=245.0s)]
*  I mean, I think Kat has, has found the, the opposing center that he's most [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=247.96s)]
*  comfortable with in the entire NBA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=254.24s)]
*  And it's a version of cat. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=256.68s)]
*  You know, that man going to the rim with, with ferocity, relentless ferocity [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=258.52s)]
*  and his, you know, making himself into a true New York Nick, you could see the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=264.0s)]
*  crowd get super fired up every time he went to the, to the rack and bang, turn [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=268.48s)]
*  her out of the way and, and, you know, got his and really he and Brunson set the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=273.36s)]
*  tone in, in the first quarter with that intensity that they brought and they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=278.84s)]
*  controlled the flow of the game in the first quarter and it was weird that the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=282.92s)]
*  Pacers didn't really have a, any kind of retaliation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=288.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the closest we got was that 10 points with four minutes left in the third [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=291.68s)]
*  quarter. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=295.04s)]
*  Um, and then they kind of got there again in the fourth quarter, but really, uh, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  they just never got there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=300.72s)]
*  Mahoney. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=301.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  But to that point with cat, it was really telling that this series for him has [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=302.56s)]
*  become not really a post-up series, not really a three point shooting series. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  It is drive past miles Turner drive past Pascal Siakam, Pacers have nobody who [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  can stay in front of him so long as cat can say at a foul trouble and granted, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  you know, he had about three or four dumb files in this game. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=319.48s)]
*  I think he easily could have been called for five or six, uh, you know, a shove [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  here or there that just didn't get whistled. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  And maybe this game is very, very different, but he definitely showed up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=326.68s)]
*  Brunson definitely showed up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=330.0s)]
*  Like those guys had to deliver. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=331.04s)]
*  And the depth also did like, honestly just might be the best Landry [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=333.16s)]
*  Shammet playoff run we've ever seen from him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  Has there been a Langer Shammet playoff run? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=340.6s)]
*  Is the thing he tends to be. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=342.48s)]
*  He tends to be the guy who comes into the playoffs and just immediately disappears, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=343.8s)]
*  like way too small, gets boxed out of series, too streaky a shooter to really [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  make a difference. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  This guy was like freezing TJ McConnell in the lane, like kill dribble on the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=352.6s)]
*  baseline, completely stalling out the Pacers offense. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  I, the pressure that Shammet and Delon and Delon Wright have brought to the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=360.12s)]
*  series, I think has been like a really meaningful thing, which is crazy to say. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  McConnell was another one who sucked tonight. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=367.24s)]
*  Um, the really everybody in the Pacers, you look through, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  Mather and has 23 points and they scored 94 as a team. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  That's pretty rough. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  Um, the town's piece of it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=379.16s)]
*  I still feel like anytime a team isn't just completely attacking him on defense [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=382.56s)]
*  house, especially once he gets to four fouls, I would just go at him every play. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=386.72s)]
*  Cause I just feel like law of averages. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=391.88s)]
*  He's just going to foul somebody. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  It was funny to hear Van Gundy, uh, on this three man team we had tonight. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=394.88s)]
*  And we've had all through the playoffs, both conferences, just poor Kevin Harlan. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=400.32s)]
*  His usage rate is all time low. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=405.52s)]
*  He's basically like McHale bridges in those games when he has six shots and 48 [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=407.28s)]
*  minutes, um, but it was funny to hear Van Gundy just openly saying like they [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  shouldn't put towns back in. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  He's just crazy enough to get a foul here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  Cause I thought the same thing, 0.6 seconds left. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  That's like just enough time for him to foul somebody on a pick. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=422.72s)]
*  Uh, but for the most part, I think this series has been a win for him. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=426.04s)]
*  An enormous win and all time when I mean, in the same way that we were [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  observing Julius Randall, you know, kind of a rebranding for himself by the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=433.88000000000005s)]
*  excellent performance he had for the Timberwolves, uh, in the West until [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  recently, I know, but look, for the most part, like who saw that coming, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=444.72s)]
*  And you had to do some, some research. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  You had to go back into your, uh, you know, basketball reference, Bill [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=450.88s)]
*  Simmons database to compare him to some 19 and nine. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=457.84s)]
*  Him and Elgin Baylor. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=458.44s)]
*  Him and the greats. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  You had to do that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  He made you do that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=461.28s)]
*  Julius Randall made you do that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  But the town thing is- [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=463.84s)]
*  But now he's going to make Charlotte give him a weird free agent offer. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's going to be the only one he gets. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=467.88s)]
*  Undoubtedly true. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=469.23999999999995s)]
*  But towns, uh, also this is like a version of towns that I don't think [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  anybody could say we've seen this from Carl Anthony towns in the playoffs. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  Like this is the Eastern conference finals for Christ sakes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=478.12s)]
*  It's very impressive to me. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  I like how hard he's playing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=483.68s)]
*  Big thing for me is like, whatever the stats are going to come and go. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=484.32000000000005s)]
*  His shots are going to come and go, but he really seems like he fully gives a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=487.12s)]
*  shit, which I think is, uh, and if I felt that way last year with him too, in the, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=490.8s)]
*  uh, Western finals too. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=494.56s)]
*  So we've at least gotten over that hump with them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=496.12s)]
*  Mahoney. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  I think he's had great responses, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=499.12s)]
*  It's like, he's been embarrassed a couple of times in this series, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=501.0s)]
*  especially defensively. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  Like we were just talking about played off the floor in fourth quarters, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=504.44s)]
*  taken out of the rotation for critical stretches. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=507.6s)]
*  Like Mitchell Robinson kind of taking his spot a couple of times, and then [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=509.72s)]
*  you get a huge response in crunch time. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=513.36s)]
*  Then you get this response to the Indiana win. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=515.88s)]
*  I don't know that you can ask a lot more of towns than this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=518.96s)]
*  He's on a bad knee right now and he's still driving all that much. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  He's still hold like relatively holding up defensively again, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=525.1600000000001s)]
*  give or take all the fouls and credit to him too, gets to kind of punch it [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=528.28s)]
*  through with that final possession before the Pacers took everybody out. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=531.72s)]
*  It was like a Indiana couldn't pull down a defensive rebound. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=535.12s)]
*  Josh Hart gets it rerouted to towns, pump fake drive, finish over [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=538.44s)]
*  Matheran, shrug off everybody. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=541.96s)]
*  We're going home. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=544.12s)]
*  Like he deserves that kind of moment with the series he's had. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  And the Knicks were like dying to let the Pacers back in the game in the third [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=548.12s)]
*  quarter and the Pacers weren't there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=551.36s)]
*  There was like a six minute stretch where it just felt like the ball was flying [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=552.96s)]
*  around off everybody. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=556.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=557.96s)]
*  You mentioned the towns playing with a bad knee. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=558.5200000000001s)]
*  Not sure how bad the knee was because it felt like he was doing a lot of stuff out [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  It was just, I had the hockey game on the smaller TV as I was watching the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=567.16s)]
*  basketball and I was just thinking how funny it is. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=570.52s)]
*  We you're on the, you're at the playoff basketball game and like Carl towns [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=573.24s)]
*  cutting it out with a sore knee. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=576.92s)]
*  And then you go to the hockey game and guys like they have just divots in the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=579.04s)]
*  center. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=582.28s)]
*  They're funny. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=584.76s)]
*  We're just broken hands or broken orbital bones. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=585.24s)]
*  It's just, it's just funny how different the sports are house and classic tips. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=587.88s)]
*  I mean, with, with his, with, with the knee, he had the most minutes of any [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  Nick on the floor, 30 minutes, and he got the most attempts up, 20 attempts. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=596.04s)]
*  So, you know, take an average of it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=601.8s)]
*  So the warrior, I thought it affected his shot a little bit was the one thing I [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=603.9599999999999s)]
*  noticed it, but the barreling to the basket thing, I kind of feel like then the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=607.7199999999999s)]
*  knee piece didn't matter, but maybe so. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=612.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=614.16s)]
*  I've changed my opinion on that trade a hundred times since they made it, but now [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  I think Nick's won the trade. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=618.28s)]
*  That's where I've landed today. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=620.16s)]
*  After, after watching Julius Randall a couple of times against OKC, big win for [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=621.4s)]
*  the Knicks. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=625.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=625.96s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  I, I, uh, I've already taken a shot of Tibbs, but I think you coached a great [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=628.04s)]
*  game. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=632.72s)]
*  I honestly think that, that, um, him getting four guys on the bench, double [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=633.32s)]
*  digit minutes, uh, at this stage of, of the playoffs. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=638.88s)]
*  I mean, we are, we, we keep exclaiming out loud. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=642.64s)]
*  We're, we're shocked by the Shamett revelation, but really Delon Wright and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=645.28s)]
*  Shamett, um, and McBride. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=648.6s)]
*  And I think the move of heart to the bench, you still getting the 34 minutes [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  out of him. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=654.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=655.32s)]
*  You got to tip our hat to Tibbs here a little bit, Mahoney. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=656.08s)]
*  Completely. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=658.6800000000001s)]
*  I like, maybe he should have been here all along. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=659.32s)]
*  Maybe they should have been playing this way. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, they, they brought in Delon Wright and Landry Shamett a little later [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=663.44s)]
*  in the season, but once they did, maybe those guys should have been in the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=666.08s)]
*  rotation. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=668.36s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=669.2800000000001s)]
*  We can, we can talk about that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=669.84s)]
*  I'm sure to encourage positive growth. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=670.88s)]
*  This is Tom Thibodeau and we're meeting him where he is, which is in a moment of [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=673.24s)]
*  desperation, started turning to these guys and really found something with it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=677.12s)]
*  Like, I don't even think it's just a minutes thing in terms of keeping the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  starters minutes down. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=684.12s)]
*  I think having those guys in for meaningful runs where the Knicks are winning on [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=685.16s)]
*  defense, where they're creating all this energy, where they have the momentum. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=689.24s)]
*  To me, that's taking a lot of pressure off of OGN and OB, Mikhail Bridges, Josh [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=692.68s)]
*  Hart too. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=696.84s)]
*  You really don't even dwell or notice on the fact that like those guys can't hit [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=697.64s)]
*  threes right now. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=701.8s)]
*  Aren't really hitting a lot of shots because the Knicks are winning with this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  defensive energy. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=705.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=707.12s)]
*  Their bench, I guess heart. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=709.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=711.24s)]
*  Two for two for eight from three and the next, the Pacers seem super happy to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=713.76s)]
*  give them as many as you want. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a weird thing for me. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  I agree that Tibbs coached a good game tonight. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=722.52s)]
*  I also think it was reprehensible that he didn't ever try to figure out how to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=724.96s)]
*  use his bench during the season. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=728.32s)]
*  I remember doing a podcast after that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=729.76s)]
*  Nick sold the game in Boston in like February where he's just playing the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=731.96s)]
*  goats, guys, huge minutes in this game that ultimately they really can be the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=735.88s)]
*  three suit of the four seat. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=738.96s)]
*  It's like, what are you doing? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=740.08s)]
*  And I think the Knicks fans in my life, they're, they're just apoplectic that it [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=741.44s)]
*  took until this series losing game one to then now experiment with all these [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=747.1600000000001s)]
*  different lineups and lineups that really haven't played together all season. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=753.2s)]
*  But in a way better late than never, I guess, because it's definitely helped them. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=758.12s)]
*  Um, I don't know. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=762.9200000000001s)]
*  I we've, we've seen Shamett for a few seasons here. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=764.36s)]
*  I, I refuse to believe he's like a late bloomer as a playoff asset. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=767.12s)]
*  And yeah, there's been a bunch of teams that have given up on Shamett record. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=771.2s)]
*  But he's out there. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  And again, like these lineups are lineups that I would never choose to put on the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=776.48s)]
*  floor in a must win playoff game, right? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=780.32s)]
*  Like lineups that should not work. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=782.44s)]
*  That should not make sense. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=784.0s)]
*  But I think it speaks to the fact that like New York's needs right now are less [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=785.72s)]
*  for explosive offense and more for where are they getting that defensive intensity? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=789.2s)]
*  Who are the guys who are really going to pressure who are really going to play up [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=793.84s)]
*  and write and Shamett have both done that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=797.04s)]
*  McBride always does that and playing those three guys together shouldn't be a [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=798.76s)]
*  thing, but it's a thing and it's working in the series. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=802.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  And make Indiana turn the ball over and make Albert and not as comfortable, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=805.68s)]
*  which they managed to do. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  Indiana had 20 turnovers tonight. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=811.4799999999999s)]
*  The Knicks were rebound out, rebounded them by 10 for most of the game. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=814.2399999999999s)]
*  And that even had a little bit. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=817.64s)]
*  Um, but I guess from the next side, they were 28% from three and they won handily. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  Good sign for them. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=824.92s)]
*  From the Pacer side, they 20 turnovers and it felt still felt like they were [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=826.28s)]
*  going to make a run, even with like five minutes left with no, but literally [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=830.48s)]
*  nobody playing walks at Matherin. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=833.6s)]
*  I was like, I still feel like they might get going here. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=835.56s)]
*  Uh, it was a bad Halliburton game. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=837.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=839.68s)]
*  You know, a lot of smoke, including on this podcast and all the ringer [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=841.6s)]
*  podcasts about the big leap he was taking and how great he was playing. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=845.56s)]
*  And it just felt like he was flustered from the get-go with all the pressure. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=849.96s)]
*  My guess is that he'll be fine in game six. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=853.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=856.16s)]
*  I mean, this is one of those, I looked at the tape. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=856.4799999999999s)]
*  I can't believe how bad I was. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=859.16s)]
*  I'm going to do this, this, this, and this, and it will be a [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=860.56s)]
*  different Halliburton would be my guess. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=863.12s)]
*  He was the making the big leap and then he took the big shit. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=865.04s)]
*  And that happens sometimes. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=867.56s)]
*  We saw SGA, the MVP of the league and what was the game three, you know, lay [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=869.4s)]
*  a big, bad egg, it happens. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=873.28s)]
*  The good players. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=875.4799999999999s)]
*  When you start talking about like top 20 guys, top 15 guys, top 10 guys, once we [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=876.56s)]
*  go higher up the list, what, what separates the top five, top seven guys? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=881.72s)]
*  Like you noticed that one SGA game when he wasn't very good in game three, but [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=886.88s)]
*  for the most part, every single playoff game, he's been between 30 and 38 a game [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=891.0400000000001s)]
*  and consistently scoring and consistently getting his shot. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  And you just always know you can count on him, you know, and when you go through [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=899.0s)]
*  all the best guys in the league, that's usually in place, which is why even with [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=902.48s)]
*  somebody like Edwards and people are so disappointed that, Oh, what happened to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=905.84s)]
*  him in the second half of game four? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=910.44s)]
*  And why did he seem so comfortable? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=912.24s)]
*  Because there's he's being held to a certain standard. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=914.4000000000001s)]
*  I feel like Halliburton had at least was knocking on the door of that level. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=917.36s)]
*  So for him to suck tonight is just like, that's not great. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  And now he's going to take it tomorrow on the shows. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=924.6800000000001s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of they need Tyrese Halliburton to step up. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=927.12s)]
*  He's going to be the step up guy tomorrow. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=931.36s)]
*  Who was that? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=933.0400000000001s)]
*  Who was the step up guy heading in? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=934.5200000000001s)]
*  No, who was the voice you just did is that was my generic ESPN voice. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=936.08s)]
*  Every single one of the voices, all everyone, everyone. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=940.5999999999999s)]
*  I want them to have a segment called step up where they just, each of them just [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=943.8399999999999s)]
*  screams at the TV that somebody needs to step up. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=947.4s)]
*  And then at the end of the segment, they all just look at each other and they tell [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=949.7199999999999s)]
*  each other to step up. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=952.8s)]
*  Why are you going on our content? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=954.24s)]
*  This could easily be a hottest take style. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=955.8399999999999s)]
*  10 minute segment. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=959.4799999999999s)]
*  Anyone in the world, you know, like any world leaders who need to step up, the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=960.52s)]
*  Pope, anybody like Democrats need to step up. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=965.72s)]
*  What an idea. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=969.24s)]
*  Well, that definitely I actually do need to step up. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  But pluses, main screen needs to step up because I can't find Mission Impossible. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=974.04s)]
*  Who is doing the UI on those things definitely needs to step up. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=981.28s)]
*  It's a disgrace. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=984.08s)]
*  Well, I think Tyrese, but long story short, Tyrese Halliburton might need to step up. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=985.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes, there is a version of a Tyrese Halliburton game where he shoots seven [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=989.0s)]
*  times and is still awesome. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=992.68s)]
*  He's done that before. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=994.36s)]
*  Plenty of times. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=995.36s)]
*  This was not that I think it was it was distressing how little he was even looking [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=996.16s)]
*  at the rim and the times where even he would turn the corner on the next defense. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1000.72s)]
*  And it's just like he looks like he's waiting for the breakdown to make the easy [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1004.6s)]
*  pass for the layup that frankly has been there for the last three games or so. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1008.96s)]
*  But if you're that guy, if you're a top 20 guy, you are the breakdown. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1013.32s)]
*  Like that's your job to create that and to capitalize on it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1016.96s)]
*  And the fact that he wasn't really looking to score for, I would say at least two, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1020.24s)]
*  maybe two and a half quarters. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1023.48s)]
*  That it just wasn't enough for where the Pacers were. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1024.96s)]
*  House, do you think it's because Michael Imperiali was there? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1028.28s)]
*  You think he was psyched out? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1030.72s)]
*  It's one thing to play in front of Chalamet, Spike Lee, some of the stars. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1031.96s)]
*  But when Christopher is in the house, I mean, it's a different level. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1035.16s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1038.88s)]
*  You don't want Christopher going to the trunk. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1039.96s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1041.88s)]
*  He is Paul. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1043.48s)]
*  Paul is dead, right? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1044.76s)]
*  Paul Walnuts is dead. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1045.92s)]
*  I think he is. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1047.4s)]
*  So that would have been the next move is to put courtside just all the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1047.92s)]
*  sopranos characters, the living ones just all in a row. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1053.08s)]
*  But some of the key ones are dead. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1056.1999999999998s)]
*  But I still think that would be a little intimidating. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe get all the mafia movies. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  Can we pour one out for Miles Teller, though, who was next to [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1061.8799999999999s)]
*  Timothy Chalamet, couldn't even get the broadcast shout out. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  Like he was just the normal guy sitting to the side of Timothy Chalamet. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1068.04s)]
*  That's Miles Teller. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1071.32s)]
*  It's a tough beat. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1072.12s)]
*  He's in Top Gun Maverick for God's sakes. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1073.0s)]
*  He's in Whiplash. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1075.76s)]
*  He's been in some big movies. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1076.56s)]
*  He was just in a movie that led Apple TV. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1078.4399999999998s)]
*  He should have at least gotten a Chiron. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1080.84s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1082.32s)]
*  He's at Chiron level at bare minimum. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1083.0s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1086.24s)]
*  My son was admiring Chalamet's fit. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1087.52s)]
*  He likes the Chromeheart and Nix pants. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1090.16s)]
*  We thought it was a great job. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1092.04s)]
*  He thinks he thinks Chalamet has done a great job with the, with the, with [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1093.64s)]
*  the fits during the games. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1097.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1099.0s)]
*  I'm not going to bring him in later for a fit fit thing. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1099.6s)]
*  Brunson. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1103.0s)]
*  Six for nine in the first quarter, laid this back down. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1105.4s)]
*  I had in the Taylor fade by my weekly prop. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1108.8s)]
*  I did over 30 and a half because I thought Brunson was going to have a big game. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1112.4s)]
*  I think he finished with like 34. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1115.92s)]
*  But one of the reasons I thought that was because I didn't think towns was going [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1117.56s)]
*  to be good in this game. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1119.84s)]
*  So whatever they got from towns, I wasn't expecting. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1120.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm not positive. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1122.88s)]
*  The Pacers were expecting either, but, um, this Brunson thing, his eyes just [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1124.08s)]
*  light up on them hearts. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1129.0s)]
*  You mentioned it before, Rob. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1129.96s)]
*  It's like the Nemard Pacers and then the non-Nemite when he sees Haliburton, it's [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1131.96s)]
*  he looks like house passing an Arby's. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1136.28s)]
*  Hey, Hey, no, that's a compliment. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1138.4s)]
*  House. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1141.68s)]
*  I know that was an excited growl. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1141.92s)]
*  Hey, it was, I met somebody else who loved Arby's and I always bring you up [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1144.68s)]
*  when somebody else likes Arby's because you're my number one person. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1151.0800000000002s)]
*  Do you know each other? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1155.52s)]
*  We should. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1156.64s)]
*  No, I just feel like it's almost like houses apart, odor and Arby's, even [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1157.1200000000001s)]
*  though he owns nothing, but I've invested enough believe me. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1161.04s)]
*  Thank God for Arby's anyway, Jalen Brunson, Rob go. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know how to come back from Arby's. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1171.12s)]
*  No, he, look, there really is only one Pacer who can guard him in this series. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1174.92s)]
*  He's currently kind of injured clearly, at least being held back to some degree. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1178.6s)]
*  I thought it was a sign of, you know, it was represented representative of [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1182.76s)]
*  Indy's desperation that Ben Matherin was not only like the only guy who could [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1186.6s)]
*  score, but the only guy they would even trust to guard Jalen Brunson during [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1190.16s)]
*  critical stretches of the second half. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1194.8s)]
*  Like they gave him that job too, because like Shepard can't do it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1196.44s)]
*  Nemhard cannot do it. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1201.2s)]
*  Those guys have no impact honestly on Jalen Brunson and they're good [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1202.3200000000002s)]
*  defenders who fight through screens and like can be very effective against [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1206.16s)]
*  any other kind of score. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1209.8000000000002s)]
*  But for some reason, Jalen Brunson can just kind of bump them off. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1211.3600000000001s)]
*  He can shoot right over the top of Nemhard. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1213.8400000000001s)]
*  They don't bother him at all. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1215.92s)]
*  And so if we are watching which injuries are real and which ones are exaggerated, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1216.8400000000001s)]
*  Carl Thinney Towns, you know, clearly good enough to drive and still be a [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1221.44s)]
*  dominant player in this game. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1224.24s)]
*  Aaron E Smith has to be a fully operational member of the Pacers [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1225.72s)]
*  rotation if they're going to slow down Jalen Brunson at all. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1229.16s)]
*  Well, the recipe for the Knicks to come back from three one house, if you're [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1231.88s)]
*  doing the 2004 Red Sox, don't let us get one, don't let us get to whatever Kevin [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1235.88s)]
*  Moller said, it's easier to do it when you have five and seven at home. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1241.48s)]
*  You win five, you have to go on the road and take six. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1246.56s)]
*  But when the Celtics tried to do this last round, no Jason Tatum, zombie, poor [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1251.0s)]
*  Zingas, Sam Hauser and a sprained ankle and the Knicks played the best game [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1255.72s)]
*  they've had and were completely healthy. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  This, uh, this Pacer situation, Niesmith, not healthy Turner and [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1262.76s)]
*  Nemhard coming off terrible games. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1267.8799999999999s)]
*  Pacers bench, not doing that well. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1269.76s)]
*  Halburn coming off a bad game and weirdly some pressure for a team up three, two. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1271.28s)]
*  Um, what do you think the line is for the series now house? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1278.64s)]
*  Don't look. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1282.88s)]
*  Oh, this is a great question. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1283.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1286.0s)]
*  Uh, the Pacers are definitely still favored. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1286.3600000000001s)]
*  Let me think about this. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1289.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, plus for the, for the Knicks, the Pacers are favored minus two 20. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1290.88s)]
*  Rob, I can't remember if you know how to do ads. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1301.44s)]
*  I'll let you have a guess if you want. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1303.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm going to say they're more than that. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1305.0s)]
*  I think it's probably more of like a minus five or six hundred. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1306.36s)]
*  Oh, look at the big balls on bread. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1309.08s)]
*  Um, minus, minus three 70 for the, there we go. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1314.9199999999998s)]
*  We are right in between the two of us. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1319.8s)]
*  Well, the Knicks were minus five today, which I jumped out of me immediately [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1321.4799999999998s)]
*  because I thought it was going to be like a minus two. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  So Vegas, obviously. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1326.76s)]
*  And Fandel and everybody else probably liked some of the metrics that were going. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1328.7199999999998s)]
*  Um, I do think they saved Niesmith a little bit. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1333.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1336.36s)]
*  This is one of those you feel it out. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1336.9599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I didn't realize miles Turner was going to be hot in this game. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  Ooh, I didn't realize Walker was going to make three threes. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1343.32s)]
*  Um, but none of those things were happening in Carlisle was like, all right. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1346.6s)]
*  I'll save my guy for a, for Saturday night. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1350.9199999999998s)]
*  Here's the, here's, oh, I'll save this. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1353.52s)]
*  We're going to take a break for the podcast. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1355.3999999999999s)]
*  Keep going on YouTube. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1356.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1357.9199999999998s)]
*  Still here on YouTube. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1358.6s)]
*  Um, here's the best thing about tonight. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1359.7199999999998s)]
*  We get a game on Saturday night now. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1361.24s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1363.0s)]
*  It's like, we weren't going to have basketball for a [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1364.04s)]
*  week. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1366.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1366.72s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1367.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1367.92s)]
*  I'm going to order Arby's. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1368.28s)]
*  How about that? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1369.28s)]
*  I will have the meats. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1370.8400000000001s)]
*  Me and Jalen Brunson will have the meats. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1372.0s)]
*  The Jalen Brunson thing that I wanted to observe is that the, you know, it's very [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1374.3600000000001s)]
*  stupid observation that I made at the top of the show, but they, um, created [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1379.68s)]
*  their force of will. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1385.52s)]
*  They dictated their pace by the high percentage shots that Jalen Brunson gets [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1387.2s)]
*  and takes, and the same thing is true of, of towns. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1392.52s)]
*  I want for the record to say out loud, I tailed the Brunson wager, the Brunson [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1396.08s)]
*  Rockville, of course, I mean, I, my, uh, my token, my, I'm going to, you know, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  cash that in, um, but it was based on the idea that towns might be compromised. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1407.56s)]
*  He wasn't compromised, but it was based on that. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  And we also had as a narrative, Nick's aren't going to go out like this. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1415.08s)]
*  This, not this, this next team with this Nick's fandom, what they've [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1420.08s)]
*  done in these playoffs. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  They're not going out with a whimper. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1425.8s)]
*  They're going to come home and show pride. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1427.36s)]
*  JJ John Distremski made a great case for why the Knicks would show up and show [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1429.76s)]
*  out tonight and they, they, they did that. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1434.08s)]
*  And I do think, I mean, let me get your guys take on this. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1436.8s)]
*  I've said this a couple of times and I think it's, you know, reasonable argument. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1439.76s)]
*  I think the Knicks have the best five in the East and you know, that doesn't [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1444.48s)]
*  necessarily mean they're the best team in these, but I think they have the best [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1451.52s)]
*  five in the East. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1454.92s)]
*  We argued about this on the phone today because the plus minus stats for the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1456.04s)]
*  five men units do not back this up. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1460.04s)]
*  And yet I don't think you're wrong. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1462.0s)]
*  Well, I think this is why I think you're wrong. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1463.76s)]
*  Uh, which five are you talking about? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1465.96s)]
*  Cause I think there's, you know, like is it the Mitchell Robinson five [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1467.92s)]
*  or the Josh Hart five? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1471.0s)]
*  It's definitely the heart five. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1472.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, but the stats say it's the Mitchell Robinson. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1473.52s)]
*  I understand. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1477.48s)]
*  It's the better one. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1478.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1478.96s)]
*  I'm not, I, I understand, um, the point, but I just, you know, when they, they, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1479.5600000000002s)]
*  they have six, they have six guys, they have five and a half guys. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1484.76s)]
*  Cause what you get out of Mitchell Robinson is half a game. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1488.04s)]
*  You get 20 minutes or you know, uh, you get two thirds out of it, out of a [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1490.4s)]
*  minutes wise out of him. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1494.68s)]
*  Um, but I, I, I would stack this next five up against every other five in the, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1496.44s)]
*  in, in the East. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1501.84s)]
*  And I think that's an element of, of why we're sitting here at this point [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1503.04s)]
*  with a game on Saturday night. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1506.64s)]
*  Can I give you another element? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1508.28s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1509.76s)]
*  This is going to make Rob feel awkward, but this is really houses love language. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm terrified of whatever you're about to say. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1515.16s)]
*  I honestly have no idea. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1517.08s)]
*  I hope it involves Frank from white Lotus. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1518.3600000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, it's not. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1520.4s)]
*  Frank is not involved. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1521.32s)]
*  Um, you know, if Indiana wins one more game, we're going to have an [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1522.44s)]
*  Indiana versus Oklahoma city finals. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1526.72s)]
*  But if the Knicks win the series, we'll have the Knicks in the finals. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1531.08s)]
*  And if you've noticed from ratings and interest, it's a little more interesting [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1534.48s)]
*  nationally when there's a New York team in the finals, I'd like to bring you back. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1539.28s)]
*  To the year 2002 game six, Portland Lakers. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1544.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1552.4s)]
*  Game six Sacramento Lakers in Sacramento. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1553.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1556.28s)]
*  If Sacramento wins, we're going to have a Sacramento New Jersey finals. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1556.92s)]
*  And David Stern was like, not on my watch. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1563.88s)]
*  This is not happening. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1568.24s)]
*  We are not letting this happen. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1569.52s)]
*  And we did not get a Sacramento New Jersey finals. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1571.68s)]
*  And I'm just, I just, I just, I'm being, I just would be careful. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1574.24s)]
*  Let's be careful out there for game six. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1579.8400000000001s)]
*  If you're wagering, just be careful. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1581.64s)]
*  Put 2000 new Smith pretty quickly. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1585.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1587.4s)]
*  Conspiracy bill. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1587.92s)]
*  I'm not going to dress up like conspiracy bill, but it just. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1588.92s)]
*  How sweet the 2002 game six. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1592.4s)]
*  We've talked a lot about over the years, just saying in all in the back of my head, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1595.16s)]
*  it's in the deep recesses of the back of my head. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1599.28s)]
*  Well, I guess when I remembered it, when, when Dallas [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1601.52s)]
*  won the effing lottery two weeks ago on my first day, I remembered that 2002 game. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1604.08s)]
*  Six weird things happen. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1609.96s)]
*  Miracles, weird things, miracles, miracles, NBA miracles, miracles. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1611.3999999999999s)]
*  Like Aaron New Smith having 3000 six minutes in the first quarter. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1616.3999999999999s)]
*  Like some miracles can happen. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1620.08s)]
*  You just never know. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1621.76s)]
*  Um, so we'll have this, this Indiana game Saturday night, which will be, I'm trying [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1623.0s)]
*  to think if there's been a bigger Indiana game since the 2000 finals, I'm going to say no. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1631.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1636.88s)]
*  I think the only thing that would even come close is when they had a chance to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1637.88s)]
*  upset the LeBron calves, you know, like they were in some of those series and [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1640.8s)]
*  had some pressure packed games. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1644.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1646.28s)]
*  They never had a chance to, if we win this game at home, we go to the finals. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1646.76s)]
*  I don't think they've been in that situation because I was thinking [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1650.96s)]
*  during the Pistons when they. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1652.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, three or Oh four range. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1654.72s)]
*  They played the Pistons a couple of times, but yeah, I think. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1656.1200000000001s)]
*  What was the game where Teishan Prince blocked Reggie Miller from behind the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1660.96s)]
*  chair, the chase that was an Indiana, the chase down thing, but this is the biggest [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1664.68s)]
*  Indiana Pacers game, I think since the 2000 finals game for ironically the Koby [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1669.52s)]
*  becoming a special player game in OT after Shaq falls out. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1676.36s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1681.96s)]
*  I, I guess my question if you're Robin, if you're Rick Carlisle, how many, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1682.76s)]
*  many Pacers do you trust right now? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1687.72s)]
*  Cause we always see the number starts dropping as the playoff series goes along. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1690.52s)]
*  How many of these guys do you actually trust? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1694.3999999999999s)]
*  I thought in this game, you could see his patience being tried with OB [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1696.24s)]
*  Toppin, especially in the first half. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1699.96s)]
*  Oh, when he tried to dribble through the two guys, you know, that's not going to [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1702.12s)]
*  get you in Rick Carlisle's best side. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1705.3999999999999s)]
*  I would say I thought TJ McConnell had some bad like momentum halting plays [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1707.08s)]
*  that, but you kind of have to play him like Tyrese Halliburton needs, needs a [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1711.56s)]
*  rest at some point and Nemhard hasn't been good enough to be your backup point [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1714.72s)]
*  guard on any kind of full time basis. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1717.84s)]
*  Uh, like is Thomas Bryant going to have to continue to play? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1719.92s)]
*  How bad is that Tony Bradley hip? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1723.04s)]
*  I cannot believe I'm talking about Tony Bradley and the, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1724.76s)]
*  who would have thought that Tony Bradley hip injury would be a game six subplot. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1727.28s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1731.04s)]
*  The Thomas Bryant minutes are that bad that it becomes a subplot. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1731.48s)]
*  And so I, yeah, I think the guys who are definitely going to be in there, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1735.28s)]
*  like Shepherd is going to be in there. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1738.16s)]
*  He's, he's earned the right to have some minutes. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  He plays conservatively enough. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1741.16s)]
*  I think he's going to be in the mix. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1742.52s)]
*  Mather and clearly over the last two games has been one of the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1743.92s)]
*  Pacers best players. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1746.24s)]
*  Um, I'm, I'm a little worried about Nemhard at this point though, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1747.88s)]
*  because like in order to not play those bench guys, you have to stretch [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1750.8000000000002s)]
*  the starters more and knee Smith. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1753.76s)]
*  We'll see what state he's in physically, obviously Siakam and Halliburton. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1755.76s)]
*  And I think Turner on a good night, which these have mostly been good nights for [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1758.76s)]
*  him, you want to play those guys a lot. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1761.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1764.0s)]
*  Andrew Nemhard didn't just struggle tonight. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1764.48s)]
*  He struggled now for like a week. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1766.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's three awful games in a row, three awful games in a row shooting like [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1767.8000000000002s)]
*  20 ish, 23, 24% over those three games. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1771.8400000000001s)]
*  And doing stuff like drives to the layup to get a layup, but then kicking it out [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1775.32s)]
*  when like there was one place specifically where Jalen Brunson was the only guy who [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1779.6399999999999s)]
*  could come over and try to stop him and Brunson was coming and he kicked it back [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1783.6399999999999s)]
*  out to the corner. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1787.2s)]
*  It's like, just lay it up, just get two points. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1788.48s)]
*  I think he's got some, he's playing basketball. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1791.12s)]
*  That's what I was thinking. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1792.8s)]
*  I felt a little yipsy. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1793.8s)]
*  Very concerning from that perspective. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1795.68s)]
*  Well, I'm going to make you a, a once in a lifetime offer right now, both of you. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1797.96s)]
*  As you know, Zach Lowe and I cleaned up on New Smith Island. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1802.96s)]
*  It's been a revelation for us. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1805.5600000000002s)]
*  Just unbelievable how it worked out. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1809.04s)]
*  It's been, sorry to everybody. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1811.0s)]
*  We had to turn away in the condo projects. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1812.44s)]
*  Jarrus Walker Island. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1816.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I did buy some property. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1817.52s)]
*  Uh, not, not tonight, uh, during the season, every time he's played, I liked him. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1820.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1824.72s)]
*  Um, and he's, it's gotten to the point where I don't really understand why he's [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1825.88s)]
*  not playing more. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1829.0800000000002s)]
*  Cause I feel like he's at, I'm sure, listen, I haven't watched nearly enough [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  Pacers games as the actual Pacers fans. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1833.36s)]
*  I'm sure like, oh my God, this fucking guy thinks Walker should play more. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1835.52s)]
*  I don't know if I'm right or wrong, but I like when he's out there and I think he [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1838.4799999999998s)]
*  does good stuff and I wonder if we see him more in a game six instead of. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1841.76s)]
*  The Thomas Bryant minutes. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  Do you just go a little smaller? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1848.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not like what's Robinson. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1851.2399999999998s)]
*  He's going to hurt you on the offensive boards, but it's not like he's going to [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1852.6799999999998s)]
*  be posting up whoever it is. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1855.1599999999999s)]
*  They don't want to be posting up. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't want to be posting up. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1857.3999999999999s)]
*  And I wonder if they just try to go small. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1858.44s)]
*  Cause Walker's a dog like, he'll, he'll, he'll, uh, he'll fight anybody [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1859.96s)]
*  and fight for position. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1865.3600000000001s)]
*  He seemed really comfortable shooting a couple of those threes tonight. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1866.3200000000002s)]
*  And I thought he was playing hard. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1869.3200000000002s)]
*  Am I crazy, Rob? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1870.72s)]
*  You're not. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1872.72s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1873.3600000000001s)]
*  If you are crazy, we're crazy together because I have been on the, could [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1874.2s)]
*  Jairus Walker be a playoff X factor for the Pacers? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1878.2800000000002s)]
*  It sounds like you've, you've just bought a plot of land. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1881.8400000000001s)]
*  I looked the land up. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1884.4s)]
*  I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  like, the land has been bought. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1888.12s)]
*  My financial manager has said, like, I am ruining his professional reputation. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1889.28s)]
*  If I continue to buy land on Jairus Walker Island. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1893.12s)]
*  So I didn't realize I saw some lights on down, down in the island. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  I didn't know who else that was. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1901.28s)]
*  I'm a believer. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1902.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, these, like these lights are pretty bright though, right? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1903.76s)]
*  Like these now crucial must-win games to get you to the NBA finals. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1905.84s)]
*  I thought he, he played pretty well in this one. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1909.9599999999998s)]
*  And again, like he's, he's going to make some spotty decisions here and there. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1912.0s)]
*  If he tries to do too much with the ball. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1915.6s)]
*  But I thought in this game, he was kind of in that Nuggets [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1917.04s)]
*  championship season, Christian Brown zone of like, you go to that spot and you stand there. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1921.04s)]
*  And if you dribble the ball, we will take you out of the game and you're going to try [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1925.6399999999999s)]
*  hard on defense and you're going to fly around. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1928.3999999999999s)]
*  And he was like, he brought some of the athleticism that I thought, you know, if [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1930.72s)]
*  you're taking OB Toppin off the floor, cause you don't like some of the choices he's [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1933.8799999999999s)]
*  making, you bring in Jairus Walker and you're getting some of it back, maybe not [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1936.8s)]
*  OB Toppin level athleticism, but some real pop and some length. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1940.6s)]
*  How's she calling your broker? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1944.08s)]
*  Or are you too overextended with the three wizards rookies when you bought all the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1945.44s)]
*  stock, I mean, the Bob Carrington Island, I have Bob Carrington. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1949.16s)]
*  I have, I have a J green. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1953.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, Johnson, AJ Johnson, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1955.88s)]
*  AJ Johnson. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1958.52s)]
*  You got to remember what his name is. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1959.28s)]
*  If you're going to have stock in the island, what about Johnny Bryant? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1961.0s)]
*  Are you, are you leveraged? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1963.64s)]
*  No, no, no, nothing. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1964.56s)]
*  And he never bought any, any property on Johnny Davis Island. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1967.24s)]
*  No, no, I, I, uh, no. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1971.0800000000002s)]
*  He called in fake fire alarms for Johnny Davis Island, trying to get the island [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1973.96s)]
*  shut down. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1977.36s)]
*  I, I, yeah, I, I, I can't say out loud what I, what I really prayed for, but [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1978.08s)]
*  please don't. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1982.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1983.52s)]
*  Um, no, it's late night. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1984.48s)]
*  Um, house. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1986.08s)]
*  Are you less on Walker or no? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1987.56s)]
*  I like it. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1988.92s)]
*  Look, uh, I would be interested in getting some of the, um, what's it called? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1989.48s)]
*  Second spectrum. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1996.36s)]
*  I want to see some of the data about him on towns. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1997.1200000000001s)]
*  I'd like to see the idea of him on towns because towns is too comfortable. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=1999.6799999999998s)]
*  Why are you, why are we letting him? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2004.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2006.76s)]
*  Like that's what I'm saying. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2007.0s)]
*  Like a smaller guy should get in and try to make towns basically bowl them over. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2008.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2013.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  Just, I mean, he's got the athleticism. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2014.0s)]
*  I feel the same way about Toppin. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2016.24s)]
*  I, why isn't Toppin trying to defend towns? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2017.7199999999998s)]
*  Now, maybe that's true. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2020.1999999999998s)]
*  Maybe there are some matchups there that I'm not like catching as they're [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2021.32s)]
*  occurring in real time and you certainly don't want, uh, OB Toppin feeling like [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2025.28s)]
*  he can take 10 effing field goal attempts in, in a field goal attempts in 18 minutes. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2029.48s)]
*  That's not permissible. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2034.4s)]
*  You don't get 10 OB. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2035.56s)]
*  You don't get 10. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2037.44s)]
*  You don't get more than, than, uh, you know, Tyree Taliberton. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2038.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2043.48s)]
*  Please. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2044.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2044.64s)]
*  Can I speak for the second spectrum stats real quick, uh, about Jarius Walker on towns? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2046.48s)]
*  He's not ready for all that. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2051.2s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2052.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2053.88s)]
*  So who's left? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2054.12s)]
*  That's, that's kind of it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2056.2s)]
*  Like that's the rotation. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2057.96s)]
*  Siakam? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2058.52s)]
*  I mean, well, oh yeah, I think Siakam is going to continue. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2059.36s)]
*  He's, he's gotten some chances. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2061.48s)]
*  He honestly has not done any better than Turner has. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2063.2s)]
*  Um, I thought it was the problem with the Pacers in game six is there's some, a [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2066.2s)]
*  couple of foul trouble guys that they don't really have plan B's for Siakam is [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2069.56s)]
*  one of them, Nie Smith, I think is another one that Halbert obviously, but, um, I [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2074.16s)]
*  don't know. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2079.88s)]
*  I mean, I think we know the way that the Pacers guard towns in this series and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2080.2799999999997s)]
*  it's you make him a defensive liability or you foul him off the floor. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2083.36s)]
*  Like those are really the two options for them. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2086.68s)]
*  And they've been pretty effective both throughout most of this series is just [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2088.7599999999998s)]
*  when he does manage to stay on the floor, he can get by Turner so easily that it [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2092.6s)]
*  creates problems everywhere. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2096.72s)]
*  Can we go big picture? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  Can we go big picture on the Knicks for a second? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2099.8799999999997s)]
*  Cause I feel like I've watched six months of Knicks playoff games at this [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2101.7999999999997s)]
*  point, pretty intently. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2106.3199999999997s)]
*  Don't ask why, but I really enjoyed that pit, that piston series. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2107.64s)]
*  Um, what do you mean? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2111.8799999999997s)]
*  Don't ask why it's good basketball. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2113.04s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2115.12s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2115.72s)]
*  Are the Knicks. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2117.08s)]
*  We always talk about good hangs. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2118.08s)]
*  Like we even called the Amy Poehler podcast, good hang. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2119.6s)]
*  Are the Knicks a good hang? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2122.48s)]
*  It's just for casual basketball fans who don't care, you know, obviously [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2123.8s)]
*  other than the betting pieces, but is it fun to watch this next team? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2127.48s)]
*  Cause I can't, I haven't really totally decided yet. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2131.0s)]
*  I, I find myself more aggravated by them than enjoying them with towns, like all [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2133.56s)]
*  the facial expressions and him calling Brunson, um, the cuts to Tibbs. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2138.96s)]
*  He has the same look on his face all the time. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2144.44s)]
*  It just looks like he's trying to pass a kidney stone. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2146.64s)]
*  Brunson's never smiling. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2149.64s)]
*  All that the bridge is the fact that nobody seems to realize that every time [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2151.56s)]
*  he goes to a spot and jumps backwards and everybody forgets that that's [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2156.16s)]
*  his jump shot every time Mitchell Robinson just bowling guys over from [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2160.64s)]
*  behind getting offensive rebounds. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2164.48s)]
*  I just find myself frustrated watching them and I have no skin in the game. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2166.48s)]
*  It's I think I've seen too many Knicks games, right? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2170.7999999999997s)]
*  I think they're pretty fun. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2173.3599999999997s)]
*  I honestly, I think this is a cat lit. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2174.4s)]
*  Mistest to me. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2176.52s)]
*  Cause you're right. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2177.32s)]
*  That some of the personalities on the court are not the most emotive [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2177.92s)]
*  like, Oh, Jan and Obi, you're not going to get a lot out of during the game. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2181.4s)]
*  But I'm, I enjoy the cat experience, the ups and the downs, the dramatic turns. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2185.08s)]
*  Like I'm, I am here to see like every night. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2189.84s)]
*  Can this guy stay on the floor? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2192.8s)]
*  Can this guy get out of his own way? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2193.96s)]
*  Can he be the all NBA caliber player? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2195.52s)]
*  He proved to be the season that we all know he's capable of being. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2198.04s)]
*  Can he be that when you need it? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2201.08s)]
*  And those have been some of the most satisfying moments of this [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2202.44s)]
*  Knicks run are the moments. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2205.0s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2205.96s)]
*  Steps up. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2206.48s)]
*  I think he's right. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2207.36s)]
*  House. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2208.04s)]
*  I agree. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2208.8s)]
*  How about this? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2209.48s)]
*  I fucking love these Knicks. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2211.08s)]
*  There I'm into them. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2212.68s)]
*  I'm glad we're talking about this. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2214.48s)]
*  Great time. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2215.64s)]
*  I think, cause I think I'm bitter about the Celtics thing. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2216.48s)]
*  And I think that's tainted. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2218.56s)]
*  I just, I'll just put all cards on the table. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2219.44s)]
*  I might still be bad. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2221.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2222.7200000000003s)]
*  House. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2223.04s)]
*  Especially when they're at MSG, I think that they have engendered this love and, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2224.88s)]
*  and, you know, being reminded of what a great venue like historic [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2231.0s)]
*  presidential precedent, important basketball has happened at MSG and [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2238.28s)]
*  presidential presidential, presidential, all of them, all the peas, probably [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2242.92s)]
*  a president there, all the peas happen at MSG. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2248.12s)]
*  Um, but it's been a really fun ride, uh, watching this team who I, I think, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2251.32s)]
*  you know, the, um, off season stuff was a goddamn miracle. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2257.68s)]
*  How did they get a Mikhail Bridges and Carl Anthony towns? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2262.7599999999998s)]
*  How did they, they traded every asset they had. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2267.0s)]
*  That's, that's how they got them. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2269.48s)]
*  It was worth it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2271.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  And the conference finals in year one. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2273.04s)]
*  And I think it's like a three year run and, and they can, I do. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2275.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2280.0s)]
*  I mean, the, the, the combination of, of where they are, I feel like [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2280.48s)]
*  everything's on the table. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2284.44s)]
*  You could tell me this is Tibbs's last game at coach on Saturday. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2285.48s)]
*  You could tell me they're going to have Janice next year. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2288.88s)]
*  I'm ready for anything with them. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2290.72s)]
*  This is the East though. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2292.28s)]
*  You know, like there's that thing where you write your name on the [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2293.32s)]
*  SAT and you get 200 points. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2295.2400000000002s)]
*  You play in the Eastern conference. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2296.72s)]
*  Like that's 41 wins. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2298.0s)]
*  I think you're going to be all right right there. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2300.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2302.32s)]
*  Um, I will say one thing all season was so good house. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2303.68s)]
*  I agree with you on MSG and it's fun to have the celebrities there. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2307.96s)]
*  I will say this, I have noticed this over and over again, the people [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2311.2400000000002s)]
*  courtside around the area, a lot of people on the phones and I think [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2314.6s)]
*  the next fans have to really police. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2319.6s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not like the chalet may guys, but there'll be somebody [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2321.3199999999997s)]
*  shooting free throws and you'll see behind and it'll be in the front row [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2324.88s)]
*  and it'll be six people just texting. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2328.0s)]
*  And it's like, you're at game five of the fucking Eastern conference finals. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2330.44s)]
*  And you guys have a reputation as being some of the best basketball fans in [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2334.04s)]
*  the earth and you're sitting on the wood, get off your fucking phone. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2337.24s)]
*  Well, plus get off your phone. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2341.12s)]
*  It could be Mitchell Robinson shooting in which case it's [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2342.2s)]
*  you make it hit by a field goal. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2344.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2348.12s)]
*  So who wins game six? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2348.3199999999997s)]
*  It's in 48 hours. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2349.6s)]
*  Pacers. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2351.96s)]
*  Pacers. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think I'd bet it either way. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2358.24s)]
*  Do we wait to see who the refs are? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2362.0s)]
*  It's something I'm definitely going to do on Saturday. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2364.7599999999998s)]
*  Did we get a Tony brothers? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2367.4s)]
*  Tony brothers. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2369.8399999999997s)]
*  What's wrong with Tony? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2371.0s)]
*  It's a solid game. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2372.0s)]
*  Now I think about it some more. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2374.84s)]
*  The extender. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2377.08s)]
*  Monday. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2377.96s)]
*  I think it'd be really tough to meet this Pacers team three days, three [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2378.36s)]
*  games in a row with how, how one of those games are going to have a [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2382.28s)]
*  really good offensive game. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2386.16s)]
*  One of those games, Carlisle is going to figure out something, but I [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2387.2s)]
*  think I'd probably lean Pacers because I, I just think their style, especially at [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2390.92s)]
*  home, I believe in it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2396.28s)]
*  But it does the knee Smith 15 minutes today does scare me a little bit. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2399.76s)]
*  It should. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that combined with them hard being this bad, like that's, that is a [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2403.7200000000003s)]
*  little bit spooky, but Turner will be better at home. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2407.36s)]
*  Turner will be better. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2409.8s)]
*  How Jim McConnell be better at home today was dying for the random TJ McConnell. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2410.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm just going to take over a quarter for six minutes, but he did the opposite. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2415.0400000000004s)]
*  But I, he, he, he has that in him, which they need. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2419.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm trying to think from a Nick standpoint, probably the [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2424.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm trying to think from a Nick standpoint, probably hitting a bunch of threes. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2427.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, Brunson has to be around 30. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2431.6400000000003s)]
*  They need something major from towns and they need the bench guys to be [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2433.92s)]
*  decent would be the recipe. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2437.48s)]
*  Um, you guys both talked about, okay, see, and you're on, on podcasts this week, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2439.1600000000003s)]
*  but, um, why are, why do you think people are so begrudgingly, um, careful [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2443.0s)]
*  about calling them a great team? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2450.12s)]
*  Cause they're young. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2452.84s)]
*  I think mostly, I think people don't fit the profile. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2453.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2456.48s)]
*  I mean, they're profile wise. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2457.04s)]
*  They're like, like closer to like the Iverson Sixers or something. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2459.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like, but if you supercharge their defense and also supercharged Allen [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2463.3999999999996s)]
*  Iverson, and that's not a formula that we're used to like wrapping our heads around, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2466.96s)]
*  you know, a defense first team that is this defense forward in the modern MBA is, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2470.3599999999997s)]
*  is a bit of an anomaly on this stage. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2474.72s)]
*  I told house this on the phone today. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2476.8799999999997s)]
*  They've played nine playoff games at home. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2478.64s)]
*  They want to aid them by 51, 19, 43, seven, 32, 36, 15 and 30. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2480.96s)]
*  And they lost one game to Denver game when they're up nine with three minutes [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2489.08s)]
*  left and lost the game by two. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2492.0s)]
*  This is about as dominant of a home team as we've seen through three rounds. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2494.04s)]
*  And I think that crowd, I think they're young guys are more comfortable [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2497.8s)]
*  at home to begin with. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2501.76s)]
*  It's usually when they go up eight to 10 and their defense takes it over. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2503.08s)]
*  I just think like, I was saying a house, I really regret not just banging the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2506.2s)]
*  blowout odds for every game. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2512.68s)]
*  Cause we should have seen it. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2514.3599999999997s)]
*  Cause especially the history of the playoffs, young teams like this built [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2515.3999999999996s)]
*  around a talented guy, they usually kind of kick everybody's ass like this. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2519.16s)]
*  And I wonder like even watching the game tonight, I I'm just hard pressed to think [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2524.2799999999997s)]
*  either of those teams have much of a chance. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2529.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, look at the way the Pacers responded to Nick's level defensive pressure. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2531.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2535.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2535.8399999999997s)]
*  I think about the decisions that sometimes cat will make on the move or [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2536.12s)]
*  OG or McKale bridges will make on the move as they try to navigate through the [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2539.6s)]
*  lane and they're trying to make those connecting passes you have to make. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2542.68s)]
*  I, I don't see it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2546.24s)]
*  I think the thunder should and will be a heavy favorite against either of these [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2547.68s)]
*  teams. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2550.7599999999998s)]
*  They deserve that. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2551.04s)]
*  They are a great team. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2552.0s)]
*  They're, they're an all time team, kind of like hiding in plain sight. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2552.92s)]
*  All that is a hundred percent true. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2556.2799999999997s)]
*  And I will be banging hard every one of their home games and playing all [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2558.6s)]
*  spreads and everything. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2565.2s)]
*  But on the perception question, I think, you know, it's right to think about this, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2567.12s)]
*  this whole season in context, the league kind of has a role in this. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2575.0s)]
*  Like the league isn't out there promoting SGA. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2580.7599999999998s)]
*  They, it wasn't back in October. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2583.96s)]
*  We were looking at this all year. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  We've all done it on our, I remember doing a whole monologue about this, about, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2588.64s)]
*  you know, LeBron and Kurt, we love those guys. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2592.64s)]
*  But the rant it's time to start pushing the new dudes and they're just over and [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2594.6s)]
*  over again, hinging on LeBron and Curry and these Saturday night ABC games. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2599.04s)]
*  It's not like they didn't know. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2603.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2604.04s)]
*  See, it was going to be good house. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2604.3199999999997s)]
*  They're over under was like 61 wins. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2606.08s)]
*  The thing that I shared with you, we were talking earlier. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2609.16s)]
*  I'm interested in Rob's opinion. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2612.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, SGA didn't help himself in the Olympics. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2615.36s)]
*  Like remember the, the, the Olympics did sort of, you know, give everybody a, a [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2618.12s)]
*  big burst of basketball in August. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2623.2s)]
*  And it was high level basketball. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2625.9199999999996s)]
*  The competition was incredible. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2628.3999999999996s)]
*  And it took an amazing, like end of legacy kind of game by Steph, another [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2630.56s)]
*  career defining legacy defining game by Steph to put them to night night. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2637.0s)]
*  And SGA in Canada was forecasted to make a nice little run and they made a run [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2642.64s)]
*  again, right to the toilet because they stunk. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2649.3599999999997s)]
*  They stunk bad. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2651.64s)]
*  They were not good. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2652.48s)]
*  Jamal Murray was horrendous SGA and Lou Dort. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2653.64s)]
*  I mean, they were loaded. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2656.88s)]
*  That Canadian team was good. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2658.04s)]
*  And they always are. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2659.56s)]
*  Better. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2660.44s)]
*  I feel like waiting. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2661.2s)]
*  They always are. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2662.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2663.48s)]
*  My entire adult life for Canada basketball to be a real minted thing. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2663.72s)]
*  And it's just, it never pans out. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2668.48s)]
*  No matter who's on the roster, they're always quite talented. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2670.04s)]
*  It's an incredible pipeline of basketball ability and skill and development. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2672.6s)]
*  And for whatever reason, they just do not play well in international play. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2677.36s)]
*  That's why they're not good enough to be our 51st state. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2680.32s)]
*  Rob. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2682.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2682.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2683.1600000000003s)]
*  This is why we keep projecting their resume. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2683.48s)]
*  Step up, Canada. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2685.6400000000003s)]
*  Step up. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2687.1200000000003s)]
*  So SGA in a 16 playoff games this year, 29.8 points a game. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2688.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think that even would have been better, but that a lot of these [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2694.1600000000003s)]
*  games have been blowouts. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2696.48s)]
*  He's playing almost three minutes a game, more than three minutes game, less [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2697.56s)]
*  than he did last year in the playoffs. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2700.84s)]
*  He's now at his last 26 playoff games. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2703.1200000000003s)]
*  He's at 30 a game. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2705.88s)]
*  Which look, the stats are a little skewed. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2708.12s)]
*  It's a little like late nineties baseball steroids, just cause the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2710.3999999999996s)]
*  pace is different points are up. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2713.44s)]
*  But if you're a guard scoring 30 a game for a long sample size, I think that [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2716.72s)]
*  might even go up in the finals. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2721.48s)]
*  Um, and in some of these games, just getting any shots he wants in the biggest [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2723.16s)]
*  moments, it's really, really impressive. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2727.92s)]
*  It's what he did those first three rounds was as impressive as, um, I don't [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2731.2799999999997s)]
*  know anything I've seen from a two guard in the last 25 years, it's up there [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2737.08s)]
*  with any and Kobe's playoff runs. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2742.44s)]
*  It's, I don't want to put it with the weight of six cause what we did in the [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2745.36s)]
*  finals, especially like that was just him up by himself, just willing them. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2749.0s)]
*  But, uh, it's way up there. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2753.36s)]
*  And I, I don't think he's a finished product yet. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2755.16s)]
*  Do you Rob? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2757.88s)]
*  It feels like we still were like 90% there. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2758.7999999999997s)]
*  He's a different player than he was six weeks ago. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2761.72s)]
*  Like his development through these playoffs has been a huge story. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2764.08s)]
*  And part of the reason they're here is ability to adapt to the variety of [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2767.32s)]
*  defenses that have been thrown at him. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2770.2s)]
*  Like you would think if you're someone like Shea, you've seen everything, but [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2771.48s)]
*  you kind of haven't until you get into these seven game dogfights over and over [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2775.16s)]
*  against dramatically different teams. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2779.04s)]
*  I think he's aced kind of all those tests. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2780.96s)]
*  Like he's had moments where this game in crunch time, maybe I don't love the [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2782.6s)]
*  shot selection this game, maybe the percentages aren't there, but on balance, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2786.12s)]
*  you just see the line going up and up and up. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2790.32s)]
*  And from a founder perspective, what more could you ask for than that? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2792.3199999999997s)]
*  There's been some revisionist history house and I even might've been guilty on [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2795.9199999999996s)]
*  it on, on this pot a couple of times recently. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2800.08s)]
*  No, just, I think we all liked the trade when it happened and now it seems like [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2802.68s)]
*  the worst trade of all time, the Paul George and the SJ and the picks, but when [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  it happened, we were all like, that's amazing. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2811.9599999999996s)]
*  Nobody, the Clippers were dead in the water. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2814.52s)]
*  This was the way that they could get Kawhi Leonard, who had just won the [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2817.6s)]
*  finals MVP for Toronto. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2820.48s)]
*  And basically they're trading all this stuff for Paul George and Kawhi Leonard. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2822.72s)]
*  And they didn't want the Lakers to get him and Balmer was an owner for five [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2826.0s)]
*  years and he had to do this to keep the Lakers from getting Kawhi Leonard. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2830.2s)]
*  And also like this made them the favorites to win the title in 2020. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2834.72s)]
*  So they gave up a lot, but I, to me that it's not as bad as the Durant trade, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2839.4s)]
*  which I think when they, when the sons did that one, we were like, man, that's [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2844.16s)]
*  a lot. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2848.56s)]
*  I get why they did it, but holy shit. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2849.12s)]
*  And you have no outs now after this trade with the Clippers. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2851.2s)]
*  It was like, they had one, one way. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2854.44s)]
*  Now you could argue should they have played poker with Kawhi and just been [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2856.24s)]
*  like, look, we're back, just signed with us. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2859.8s)]
*  We have all these assets. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2862.84s)]
*  We're going to be able to keep building around this and just kind of talk them [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2864.04s)]
*  into it because it didn't seem like I want to play with the Lakers, but I don't [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2867.32s)]
*  know, I, I, that trade it's easy to say five years after the fact that's a [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2870.68s)]
*  complete catastrophe because it is. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2874.16s)]
*  But I think the reasoning behind it was, was solid. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2876.04s)]
*  What do you think house? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2879.16s)]
*  I thought it was a worthwhile gamble at the time under the circumstances and in [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2880.04s)]
*  the context and you just kind of laid it out, but the, you know, the real animus [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2883.96s)]
*  there, uh, driving animus to driving force was Balmer trying to do something [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2888.16s)]
*  with that franchise, like, right. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2894.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2896.8s)]
*  To an invigorate, not even reinvigorate them, invigorate them, invigorate. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2897.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2901.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2901.8s)]
*  And that's fair. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2902.68s)]
*  And that's fair. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2903.92s)]
*  Like he, he's the owner. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2905.0s)]
*  He's the guy with the money and they're trying to do a thing. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2906.5600000000004s)]
*  So they try, they had to pay a price for it. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2909.36s)]
*  It just turned out that the price exceeded what they, um, imagine. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  And that that happened. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2916.32s)]
*  Well, and SGA was turned out to be a, oh, I think a way better player than I [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2917.32s)]
*  would expect, even though we all liked her. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2920.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2922.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, and they also nailed the picks, Rob, which like, you look at all the picks, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2923.2000000000003s)]
*  new Orleans got, or no, the ones got from the Lakers and it's sometimes you [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2927.04s)]
*  know, the picks, sometimes you don't. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2931.48s)]
*  Like they took Jaylen Williams at the 12th pick. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2932.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2935.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2935.6800000000003s)]
*  And he's the second best player in the team. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2936.1200000000003s)]
*  They tanked for three, four months in to get the Chet Holmgren thing. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2938.32s)]
*  But they also had to get the ping pong balls in the top three, which is [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2944.56s)]
*  how it's going to test doesn't always work, even after you spend the whole [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2948.0s)]
*  year trying to lose. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2951.56s)]
*  Oh, it's true. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2953.1200000000003s)]
*  The fact. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2954.6400000000003s)]
*  So there was some luck with them. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2955.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2957.0s)]
*  Um, they made an awesome trade and the Jaylen Williams pick was great. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2957.28s)]
*  And they were lucky to get in the lottery. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2961.2799999999997s)]
*  They smartly took Chad. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2962.8799999999997s)]
*  Everything they did was super smart, but that trade, you know, I don't think you [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2964.08s)]
*  can look at it and be like, Oh my God, that's the worst trade ever. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2968.8399999999997s)]
*  I would, I would go the other way. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2972.08s)]
*  I would say that's like one of the best trades ever. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2973.48s)]
*  Turning Paul George into all the stuff they got. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2976.7999999999997s)]
*  All they gave up was Paul George. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2979.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2980.96s)]
*  All the stuff they got back. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2981.52s)]
*  It, it shouldn't be discussed as worst. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2982.8399999999997s)]
*  It should be discussed as best. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2985.16s)]
*  Of incredibly worthwhile gamble for the thunder, given their [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2987.2799999999997s)]
*  circumstance to recoup all that for Paul George. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2990.4s)]
*  And they knew they had to get rid of Russ too. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2992.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2994.04s)]
*  And for the Clippers, I still completely get it. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2994.56s)]
*  You put yourself back in those circumstances. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2996.88s)]
*  It still makes sense to me. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2998.6800000000003s)]
*  Like the premise still makes sense. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=2999.92s)]
*  It's a great trade. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3001.6800000000003s)]
*  I think honestly, like that trade has been amazing and we've spent, I would [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3002.56s)]
*  say the last maybe 18 months or so debating on and off, do the thunder need [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3006.64s)]
*  to make some kind of move? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3011.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, dude, should they cash in some of these picks that they've stockpiled for [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3013.0s)]
*  another player is Jaylen Williams going to be a good enough second star. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3016.1600000000003s)]
*  They made the big trade to get Shay and they did not make the big mistake of [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3019.88s)]
*  trading away and disrupting what, as we're saying is clearly a great team, is [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3024.32s)]
*  clearly a championship worthy team. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3028.36s)]
*  Like they invested in that project and they're fucking there. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3030.08s)]
*  Like they are right there on the precipice of doing everything they set out to do. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3033.08s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3036.76s)]
*  It's an amazing what if, cause if they lost to Denver, like I do think they'd [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3037.8s)]
*  be cashing in some chips. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3043.08s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3044.44s)]
*  I mean. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3045.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3046.52s)]
*  The sliding doors for them is what if Aaron Gordon doesn't hurt his grind? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3046.7200000000003s)]
*  I still think they probably went by 20, but I think that Denver team with healthy [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3050.52s)]
*  Aaron Gordon was Michael Myers and they just were not, you were, you know, I [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3055.52s)]
*  think once Denver fell behind 15 in that game, that kind of knew and that's been. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3059.88s)]
*  I think you and I were talking about this today has the thing that's special about [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3064.64s)]
*  this. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3068.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3068.48s)]
*  See team behind the obvious stuff is they really do break teams during a [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3068.76s)]
*  series and they, but in all three series, the team they're playing against hit a [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3073.16s)]
*  point and you could really feel it in that Minnesota series was 26 to nine. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3078.72s)]
*  And it's like, this game's over. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3083.72s)]
*  You're not coming back against. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3085.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3086.8799999999997s)]
*  See their defense is too good. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3087.16s)]
*  It's, this is a wrap. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3088.64s)]
*  You know where it's going and you can kind of feel the energy from Minnesota. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3089.8799999999997s)]
*  Go sideways and you know, they had limitations in that the Connolly thing was, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3094.2s)]
*  I think as the series went on, even, even more disastrous than we could have [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3097.96s)]
*  predicted, but the type of team that should be able to hang with them, unless you [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3101.96s)]
*  have somebody like Yoke edge is a team that plays like Indiana. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3106.76s)]
*  I just don't know if they had the horses, but the up and down pace, like let's get [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3110.84s)]
*  in a track meet that one 28 to one 26 Minnesota game for that to me is the model [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3115.2s)]
*  of how the Pacers can hang with them. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3120.76s)]
*  But there's a reason the okay. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3122.48s)]
*  See is minus seven 50 on Fandl to win the title right now. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3124.36s)]
*  Minus seven 50 house. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3128.44s)]
*  That's that's like the biggest sense. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3129.84s)]
*  You're talking like warriors. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3132.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3136.1200000000003s)]
*  2018. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3136.5200000000004s)]
*  I am nothing, if not a creature of recency bias, you know, right in the, right [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3139.48s)]
*  in the, in the kisser, but the Pacers have no chance they, I this, that's a four [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3147.1600000000003s)]
*  one series because the thing that okay. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3153.24s)]
*  See did to Minnesota, which was strangle them like a Python, Indiana, when they go [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3157.8399999999997s)]
*  all the way up to the free throw line and say, Oh, you want to bring the ball up? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3164.6s)]
*  Um, go ahead. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3168.3199999999997s)]
*  And they, and they, they start like, like, you know, mini trapping, forget it. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3170.7999999999997s)]
*  No chance. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3176.3999999999996s)]
*  What's interesting is Indiana can do the flip side to okay. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3178.2s)]
*  See it's not like, okay. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3180.92s)]
*  See has like a real point card and you could try to do the same thing, but I [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3182.6800000000003s)]
*  just think okay, see his defense is better. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3186.84s)]
*  Rob, who do you think has a better chance from what's just, I'll give you either [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3188.8s)]
*  side, Nick's okay, Nick's or Indiana go into the next round. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3193.12s)]
*  I think there's no question. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3197.48s)]
*  Indiana has a better chance. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3198.32s)]
*  The only way to beat the thunder is to be unbelievably precise with your passing. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3199.84s)]
*  And you know, you have Tyrese Halliburton has these amazing 15, a zero turnover [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3204.96s)]
*  games overall, it's an incredibly low turnover offense. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3209.24s)]
*  I suspect that would change if they meet in the NBA finals. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3212.04s)]
*  I think the pressure ratcheting up is going to be a totally different thing. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3215.24s)]
*  And it speaks to what you mentioned, Bill, about the way that the thunder break teams, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  the way that they kind of break your spirit. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3222.9599999999996s)]
*  I think a lot of it is game one, you go in, you think, you know what they are. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3224.4399999999996s)]
*  You see it. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3227.9199999999996s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3228.4799999999996s)]
*  You think, okay, we're going to go back. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3229.3999999999996s)]
*  We're going to look at the film. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3231.08s)]
*  We're going to figure out where the holes are. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3232.16s)]
*  You look at the film and it's like, there kind of are no holes or [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3234.08s)]
*  they're vanishingly small. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3237.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3238.9199999999996s)]
*  Whatever, however you think playing against the thunder is going to be, they are so [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3239.16s)]
*  much faster and more frenetic than you anticipate. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3242.72s)]
*  And so even like by the time you get to game three, it's like, I just don't think [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3246.24s)]
*  there's anything here. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3249.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, I don't know what the mechanism is again, short of, as you said, having [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3250.9199999999996s)]
*  Nikola Jokic on your team, a guy who can see over the top of that entire defense [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3253.96s)]
*  and try to make 99th percentile passes out of it. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3258.2s)]
*  Short of that, I honestly don't know what you do. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3262.56s)]
*  That's not to say that they're unbeatable. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3264.48s)]
*  I just don't know what the formula is. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3265.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3267.64s)]
*  They cause turnovers that you see in like an eighth grade basketball game of [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3267.84s)]
*  just like, that's true. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3272.4s)]
*  Long lob passes that just get picked off for a dunk. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3273.88s)]
*  I'll give you one case for Indiana that I thought was interesting. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3277.44s)]
*  I looked this up. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3280.04s)]
*  Um, there's been 10 teams. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3281.32s)]
*  Ever that have won 10 playoff games and averaged at least 28 assists a game. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  Here are the teams. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3292.7599999999998s)]
*  The 85 Lakers won the title. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3294.3199999999997s)]
*  33.7 assists a game, by the way. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3296.6s)]
*  82 Lakers won the title. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3300.12s)]
*  84 Lakers went to a game seven in the finals. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3301.96s)]
*  80 Lakers won the title. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3304.64s)]
*  86 Celtics won the title. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3306.56s)]
*  Number six, all time Indiana. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3308.92s)]
*  86 Houston made the finals. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3312.48s)]
*  19 warriors should have won the title, made the finals. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3314.92s)]
*  87 Lakers won the title and the 17 warriors won the title. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3317.7599999999998s)]
*  Those are 10 teams that did that. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3322.92s)]
*  And that made me think like, maybe this Indiana team's a little more, uh, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3325.56s)]
*  rare offensively than we're giving a credit for. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3329.6800000000003s)]
*  And then they stink tonight. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3331.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's that. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3332.76s)]
*  That's why I waited 53 minutes. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3333.88s)]
*  It's all ready to leave with that. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3337.52s)]
*  If they want tonight. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3338.7200000000003s)]
*  Here's the thing we saw value and effort out of Minnesota. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3339.76s)]
*  Um, you know, last night that you, you can try and score with Oklahoma city [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3343.04s)]
*  that your best bet is to like score with them because they go, they [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3348.32s)]
*  go gaps, you know, where, where they're just a little too happy. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3352.68s)]
*  We're taking shots that are just like comfortable and they'll go a couple [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3356.52s)]
*  of minutes without making a bucket. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3359.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, she can always, always, always get to the lane, get inside the lane [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3361.64s)]
*  and, and, you know, get a floater off or get to the, to the rim if he wants to. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3366.72s)]
*  But, uh, we're, we're old. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3370.3999999999996s)]
*  We've seen a lot of great scores. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3372.48s)]
*  She's way getting way up there for me. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3375.24s)]
*  Way up there. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3377.72s)]
*  I can't believe how easily he gets whatever shot he wants, no matter how [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3379.16s)]
*  much the defense is throwing stuff at him. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3383.72s)]
*  Like, you know, Kobe was more in that Jordan side of, and I think Wade was [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3385.8399999999997s)]
*  a little Wade, which is either go to the basket or he would shoot. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3390.2s)]
*  He didn't have a three point shot. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3392.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, he was so athletic. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3394.96s)]
*  He could always figure out a way to kind of bounce off people and get in [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3396.16s)]
*  shade the way he navigates. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3399.48s)]
*  It's honestly like watching a hockey player the way he kind of skates around [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3401.04s)]
*  until he gets what he wants and then he gets a shot he wants. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3405.6s)]
*  Well, if you're going to do that, I, I'm going to say Gretzky. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3408.16s)]
*  Like he moves that way. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3411.68s)]
*  He moves angles. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3413.2s)]
*  Like he, he has shoulder tilts to, to, to getting off his stuff where [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3414.3199999999997s)]
*  he's avoiding contact and then the footwork to finish always finishes. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3419.72s)]
*  He always finishes the, the, whatever the great move was, which most guys, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3424.2799999999997s)]
*  this is Jason Tatum was his biggest issue. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3428.44s)]
*  He'd have these great moves and he would, wouldn't finish half the time. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3430.56s)]
*  Shea finishes every time he finishes every time. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3433.7999999999997s)]
*  Crazy good finisher. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3436.64s)]
*  Like the way that his length and the way he extends around the basket is so hard [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3437.64s)]
*  to counter the mid range game is basically unstoppable no matter what your size is. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3441.0s)]
*  Like there's not a lot you can do. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3444.72s)]
*  And you know, you can have the conversation about the way he's officiated, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3446.44s)]
*  but he also plays through contact to shoot. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3448.96s)]
*  You know, this isn't James Harden pulling up through your arms and throwing the [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3451.68s)]
*  ball literally straight up in the air. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3455.44s)]
*  Like he is playing to complete plays and he honestly will convert a lot of and [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3456.72s)]
*  ones or kind of would be or should be and ones in a lot of cases. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3461.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3464.48s)]
*  I don't feel like when I was complaining a couple of times about how he was being [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3464.6800000000003s)]
*  called, I don't really blame him for some of the calls that just for whatever reason, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3468.96s)]
*  reps gravitate towards certain styles. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3473.6000000000004s)]
*  And for him, he has that way of when he drives, he could throw his left arm out [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3475.84s)]
*  and they usually think it's a foul. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3479.92s)]
*  Sometimes it isn't, but I don't think that's the reason. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3482.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, to me it's the footwork and just his hit the herky jerky stuff, the [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3485.0800000000004s)]
*  stop start, his stop start stuff is the best. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3490.2400000000002s)]
*  I feel like it's even gone up a level in the playoffs. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3493.72s)]
*  Um, I just have not seen a lot of guys like him. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3497.28s)]
*  I really think like this start to finish year for him. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3499.88s)]
*  They have a chance to go 84 and 18 for a season, which puts them in this whole [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3502.72s)]
*  like highest possible level of dudes. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3508.44s)]
*  And he's just 32 a game night after night. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3511.6s)]
*  And it's not like, Oh, he had that 75 point game that skewed his average. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3514.36s)]
*  It's every night it's 32, 38, 31, 35, 37, 29, 39. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3518.52s)]
*  And it's just the steadiness of it, especially on a team where you kind of [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3525.48s)]
*  don't know who else is going to be steady offensively. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3529.6s)]
*  Like they haven't shot the ball well from three, all playoffs, Rob. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3531.84s)]
*  And it hasn't mattered. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3535.44s)]
*  Now, I mean, they'll have select guys who will pop off here and there, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3536.84s)]
*  but the defense is so good and Shea is so good. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3539.44s)]
*  And I think in enough games, uh, Jaylen Williams has been so good that that [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3541.52s)]
*  triangulated together is enough to be an incredibly dominant, potentially [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3546.04s)]
*  historically dominant playoff team. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3549.48s)]
*  Like, I think what you described about Shea being that rock solid as a score, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3551.16s)]
*  like he doesn't have these Tyrese Halliburton games. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3555.68s)]
*  He doesn't even have the off Jaylen Brunson games where, you know, shoot [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3558.56s)]
*  six for 19 from the field or whatever. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3562.28s)]
*  Like it's just always going to be there. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3564.28s)]
*  And the fact that you could bank on that every night as a team gives you immense [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3566.36s)]
*  freedom to play guys like Alex Caruso and stretch them as far as you can, like [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3570.2s)]
*  relative non-scores play guys like Lou Dort, even more than you would otherwise [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3573.88s)]
*  be able to get away with have the odd game from Chet where he can't quite hit [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3577.6000000000004s)]
*  from three and isn't a factor offensively in the way you would want, but who cares? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3581.84s)]
*  Because Shea has 39. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3585.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, I think you just have so much you can make up for when you have those two [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3586.84s)]
*  things as your two tent poles, Shea putting in 30 plus a defense like that. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3589.84s)]
*  It's incredibly tough to beat. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3594.4s)]
*  We say this every time a team, they have it obviously needn't even four more games, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3596.1200000000003s)]
*  but we always say like, you immediately start talking about how long could this [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3599.84s)]
*  go? Could this keep going? How many could they get? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3603.6s)]
*  This feels like the safest bet to have like two in a row or three in a row. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3606.88s)]
*  So let's start with the Warriors. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3610.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, right. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3612.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3613.2s)]
*  If it happens too far ahead of it. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3613.48s)]
*  Yeah, because I still feel like they're probably going to be better next year. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3615.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3618.7999999999997s)]
*  Everybody comes back. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3619.4s)]
*  The only thing I could see changing is if they traded Lou Dort because they had to [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3620.64s)]
*  move some money around, but it's going to be the same team a year old or not, you [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3624.36s)]
*  know, all of their young stars aren't even close to their primes except for Shea. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3628.24s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3632.72s)]
*  I'm sure they're licking their chops, hoping this Indiana New York game goes seven [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3634.24s)]
*  and more and more people get or are playing semi injured. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3637.8799999999997s)]
*  Do you have a TV show recommendation for house once basketball ends for five days? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3642.12s)]
*  I'm here. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3646.04s)]
*  I'm trying to figure it out. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3646.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, everything's ending right now. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3648.04s)]
*  I think we're about to check out stick the Owen Wilson golf. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3649.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the golf one. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3652.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm excited for that. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3654.12s)]
*  I'm excited to see what's going on with stick. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3655.3199999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3657.52s)]
*  In my wheelhouse. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3657.96s)]
*  There we go. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3658.7599999999998s)]
*  We got some stuff next month. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3659.12s)]
*  The Bears coming back. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3660.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3661.3599999999997s)]
*  Can I say out loud that the last season of the Bear bored the shit out of me? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3663.68s)]
*  I think it was a transition season. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3668.2799999999997s)]
*  It's definitely can say it out loud. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3669.9199999999996s)]
*  It's also not a show that was meant to be binged. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3671.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a two. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3674.6s)]
*  It should be to house. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3676.08s)]
*  I have a show for you. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3677.52s)]
*  I'm listening. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3678.7599999999998s)]
*  It's the the the Mormon, the mom, the mom talk moms on Hulu, whatever that show is. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3680.96s)]
*  The reality show. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3687.24s)]
*  Oh, it's a reality show. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3688.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's these mom talk moms. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3690.12s)]
*  It's not a real housewife show. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3692.7200000000003s)]
*  It's it's like Mormon, the Mormon something. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3694.08s)]
*  Let me ask a question that's delicate online. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3696.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3698.64s)]
*  But I'm careful has how much menopause is involved. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3699.52s)]
*  No, they're younger. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3703.2400000000002s)]
*  They're all like young. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3705.0s)]
*  More. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3706.16s)]
*  That's a relief. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3706.52s)]
*  OK, is this the secret lives of Mormon wives? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3707.36s)]
*  Is that's what it is. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3710.28s)]
*  House. Hey, but wait, are they on Montauk? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3711.12s)]
*  They're on Mom Talk. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3714.4s)]
*  They're mom talk. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3715.48s)]
*  No, not on my not my talk there. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3716.4s)]
*  It's they're called mom talkers. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3718.36s)]
*  Mom talk. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3720.6s)]
*  What is watching with my daughter? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3721.6800000000003s)]
*  This is a show. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3723.1600000000003s)]
*  My daughter's heart. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3724.48s)]
*  So I'm watching bad television shows like this again. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3725.36s)]
*  But I think there was a swinging scandal house. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3727.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, I mean, that's not a scandal if you're Mormon. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3731.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, it was a scandal. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3734.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3735.76s)]
*  Now, well, that was the thing. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3737.1200000000003s)]
*  It's it's it violated the religion. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3738.32s)]
*  It also violated some friendships and there was some religion. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3741.0s)]
*  The Mormon, like they, you know, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3745.44s)]
*  I'm there. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3748.28s)]
*  Some stuff was house. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3749.4s)]
*  Let me tell you, it's in your real house. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjwRLpeUWk&t=3751.56s)]
