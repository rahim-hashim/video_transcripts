# Panic Time for the Timberwolves? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zVjjnhZrAA)
*  the Timberwolves of Minnesota. I don't know if you've caught a gander, a whiff of their odor.
*  It's not a great odor. There's that, the body language doctor,
*  I almost had, I had to take to Advil because my head was throbbing from all of the bad body language stuff that you're seeing in
*  the games, the weird quotes, the towns monologues,
*  the questions about what kind of shape Edwards is in, the plus minus stats and the possession stats of when Go-Baron towns play together.
*  It's a borderline catastrophe. It's panic time, House. I think it is.
*  Well, and that one is fair. See, I'm willing to be concerned about Minnesota.
*  I'm not going to give them the benefit of the doubt because they made an all in move.
*  I mean, an unprecedented, we've all been through it.
*  You've judged it one of the worst trades in the history of the league based on how much they shipped out.
*  I was too late. I wish I'd gone further.
*  Maybe so. But look, when you go on an all in move in that manner, then that means you have a conviction.
*  You have a belief. You've looked at what you have in terms of the players, their personalities, the chemistry they have,
*  that head coach in Chris Finch. And you say, we believe that we can take all of this and build it.
*  We're going to elevate it with Rudy Gobert.
*  Now, what have any of us seen in a full decades worth of Rudy Gobert that suggests that that elevation was,
*  that he was that kind of guy, that he was going to be a force multiplier?
*  All of us were skeptical. You more so than than than than me for sure.
*  And maybe Verno as well.
*  But they have a problem because Townes and Gobert through a dozen games can't play together, can't be on the floor together.
*  So who could have guessed that?
*  Verno has a host of podcasts.
*  It's basically like they have those election deniers.
*  He's hosting with a Gobert trade denier.
*  KOC. Let me tell you something.
*  I I'm going to get to see this team in person on Friday night.
*  Oh, my God. Friday night.
*  That is unbelievable.
*  I cannot wait.
*  That being said, I covered that playoff series last year, and then that was part of my calculus for what are they doing?
*  Because I thought.
*  Regardless of my opinion of Rudy Gobert, OK, regardless of that and what I think about, it happens to him in the playoffs or whatever.
*  There's Gobert truthers and then there's me.
*  And we're probably both too radical.
*  I'd like to. Can I be with you?
*  Where you are? Can I stand next to you?
*  Thank you. You can be with me.
*  I as a observer of a playoff series, Minnesota, a hundred percent could have beaten Memphis last year.
*  I mean, that was a razor thin margin.
*  And in fact, when Malik Beasley said, we feel like we should have already won this series,
*  not only did I not rip him, I agreed with him.
*  I thought, you know what?
*  They did an amazing job on Morant.
*  Amazing. As good a job as you could have possibly wanted.
*  All right. They had they had they had a good combination of star players and grinders, right?
*  The role players and the stars and kind of everybody had a pecking order and they had a couple of bad towns games.
*  And the refs really took over that series.
*  But the truth was a couple of bad towns games.
*  I know. Jesus. But it was that was your analysis of the town's games.
*  A couple of bad ones. It was the worst performances by anyone.
*  It was a perfect example, though, a perfect example of the problems that they provide.
*  Other teams with having towns as a guy that can come down and stand at the top of the key
*  and shoot threes. He played that they could not play Steven Adams, right?
*  Who was one of the most effective players on the entire Memphis team.
*  And if you play a center, he drives past you.
*  If you play a smaller guy, he will every once in a while, he'll take you down to the block.
*  And now with you've got another center down there, he's now just Sam Perkins
*  just going from three point line to three point line. Right.
*  He's guarding fours and he's and he's playing against you.
*  You've removed the thing that made him special, which is a mismatch.
*  And the most important thing is that you didn't even need him to be that good
*  because with him out of the way and you having to honor him
*  because he shoots a high enough percentage, the whole damn thing was open for Edwards,
*  who is the best player on the team.
*  How about this? They traded for the wrong fucking guy in Utah.
*  Now. I mean, just give make the same trade and just get Mitchell back
*  instead of go bare and you're probably better.
*  I just think you look at them and you go are every move that I would make
*  would be with Anthony Edwards in mind.
*  And I get it. He's young. He's immature, whatever else.
*  But how does this fit with Anthony Edwards?
*  Well, they sped up the timetable on him and they made it
*  made it seem like he's in like the Tatum right now, where we were talking about
*  Tatum is going to be 25. He's moving into Edwards is he's a pup.
*  He just got into the league like you're getting this adult
*  all NBA center who's a fully finished veteran.
*  He's never going to be better than he is.
*  And it's like basically they were like, we're a contender for years to come.
*  It's like, well, Edwards has a lot of check marks to go through before we get that.
