# The Lakers Should Trade Anthony Davis | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I)
*  You ready for the big one? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=0.0s)]
*  I got my favorite ones out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=0.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=2.48s)]
*  It's an Anthony Davis trade. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=4.48s)]
*  And the thinking is we've gone as far as we can go. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  We've done everything we could for you, LeBron. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=11.44s)]
*  You've been here since 2018. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=14.56s)]
*  We won a title together. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=17.12s)]
*  We went and got your guy, Anthony Davis. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=18.48s)]
*  We drafted your son and gave him a no cut contract. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=20.64s)]
*  Every time you've pushed us to do something, we've done it, including the Russell Westbrook [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=24.48s)]
*  trade, which you were hands off after that happened. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=28.24s)]
*  We've taken this as far as we can go. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=33.44s)]
*  And we're not going to mortgage anymore the future for this because for the first time ever, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=35.92s)]
*  the Quippers have a better arena than us and probably a better team. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=40.8s)]
*  And there's something cool happening with them and there's nothing cool happening with us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=45.92s)]
*  And we're not going to be held hostage by this anymore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=49.6s)]
*  The story in sports decades after decades is people trying to appease aging superstars. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=52.16s)]
*  It never ends well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=57.92s)]
*  We're not going to do it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=58.96s)]
*  We're going to zag the other way. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  We're going to trade Anthony Davis to the Golden State Warriors. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  And we're going to get back your buddy Draymond Green, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=66.72s)]
*  Schroeder's expiring, Kaminga, Jackson Davis, Golden State's 25 and 27 firsts, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=70.4s)]
*  and a 20, 2029 pick swap. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  That's LA's call. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  We're cashing in. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=83.04s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=84.0s)]
*  Are you sure this is the Lakers going the other way? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=85.52s)]
*  Draymond's still a really good defender. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=88.16s)]
*  It's a pretty good trade. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=89.92s)]
*  They're getting Draymond, Schroeder, Kaminga. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=91.6s)]
*  They get to roll dice with them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=94.72s)]
*  Jackson Davis. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=95.92s)]
*  And if you're the Warriors, you still have enough left and you're going to build around [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=96.64s)]
*  Davis and Curry going down the stretch and you could probably get creative with some [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=100.0s)]
*  other moves. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=103.44s)]
*  It's kind of fun. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=104.64s)]
*  I don't think the Warriors do it, but I'm intrigued. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=106.16s)]
*  Too many picks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=109.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=110.64s)]
*  So let's just say that this year's number one, which would be in the middle of the draft [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=111.04s)]
*  and a 27 unprotected first. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  So now I don't think the Lakers do it now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  You think Steph would break up? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=121.84s)]
*  Let's say the Warriors are in a position there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  No to blowing it up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=125.04s)]
*  No to, you know, trading Steph and Draymond this summer. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=129.44s)]
*  Let's just say they're not going to do that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=129.52s)]
*  Do you think Steph would be willing to break up with Draymond Green? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=131.36s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=135.76s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=136.32s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=136.8s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=137.36s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=137.84s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=138.32s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=138.72s)]
*  I think Steph would be willing to break up with Draymond in this scenario. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=139.2s)]
*  I think the only team that you could talk yourself into this being a realistic scenario is the Lakers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  Because Draymond get to live in Los Angeles and play with LeBron. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=149.28s)]
*  Draymond might want it to happen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=152.72s)]
*  Draymond might be like, this sounds great. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=154.56s)]
*  I've always wanted to be on the Lakers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=156.48s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=158.72s)]
*  I also think it's way harder to find an Anthony Davis trade that makes sense than people realize. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=160.72s)]
*  Because I see, I have people in my life, it's time to trade Davis. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=165.12s)]
*  It's like, where? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=168.16s)]
*  You're not trading me Houston. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  They can't even trade Shangoone this year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=171.04s)]
*  It would have to be this summer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=173.2s)]
*  At that point, LeBron's 41 and people probably know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  You go around the league, you would have said in the past, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  maybe they get Carl Anthony Towns and some picks for him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=182.56s)]
*  But Carl Anthony Towns is playing great. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  And you go around the league, I think it's really hard to find the right trade for him [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  that he'd be excited about. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  To put him on a team that could actually win a title. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=193.2s)]
*  Could it be Oklahoma City? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=195.76s)]
*  No. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  They're not mortgaging everything for Davis when they have Shays big contract coming up [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=197.36s)]
*  and they got to pay Jalen Williams soon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  They're going to have to play Chet Holmgren soon. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=204.24s)]
*  And they're not trading Chet for him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=206.4s)]
*  So you go through all the teams and I think it's way harder to figure out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=207.68s)]
*  I even was like, Orlando will be a good one. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  Go look at their contracts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=213.68s)]
*  What's the Orlando trade? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  They can barely even match all the contracts to get to where AD is. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  So I go and say it was the only one that made sense. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  Orlando is interesting though. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=223.12s)]
*  If they were to give Isaac, who's like 24 million, I'm doing this doing this on top [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=224.56s)]
*  of my Cole Anthony is like 12 and then I think Jett maybe in the trade. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=229.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Maybe that gets you there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Orlando would be interesting too. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=235.6s)]
*  The problem is like the way the league is now with these different rules, it's really [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=237.84s)]
*  hard to make like a five for one. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=242.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=244.0s)]
*  You need that one awesome $28 million contract that you can put in a trade like that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=244.32s)]
*  And they just don't have it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=249.68s)]
*  So they could put, you know, they could put, you said, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=251.28s)]
*  what'd you say, Cole Anthony? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=254.32s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=256.48s)]
*  I'm pulling up a trade machine right now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=257.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=259.36s)]
*  I'm looking at spot track. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=259.52s)]
*  Isaac at 25, Anthony at 12.9 and then Jett Howard. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=261.28s)]
*  I think Caldwell Pope would have to be in it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=267.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=270.56s)]
*  I'm not sure if he has to be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=270.88s)]
*  Oh, Isaac makes 25 this year. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=272.32s)]
*  That is pretty high. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=273.92s)]
*  25. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=274.64s)]
*  That's not what I said. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=275.12s)]
*  It would work. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=275.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=276.48s)]
*  80 is $43.2 million. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=277.04s)]
*  And then for Isaac, Anthony and Jett Howard, those guys are. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, wouldn't Carter have to be in that trade though? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=286.24s)]
*  No, I mean, it wouldn't have to be like finance wise. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=288.64s)]
*  He wouldn't have to be like you could put him in there instead of Cole Anthony, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=291.52s)]
*  potentially, I think. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=294.96s)]
*  Is Sarudy on this? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=295.84s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=296.8s)]
*  You can't, you can't do a Wendell Carter. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=297.28s)]
*  You could do Wendell Carter. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=300.48s)]
*  No, you can't turn around this room or no, I can't. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=302.0s)]
*  Carter, Carter has a trade restriction. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=304.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=306.48s)]
*  80, 80 for Isaac, Anthony and Howard. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  And then like. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=309.44s)]
*  No, let's put Carter in there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=310.16s)]
*  I think I don't think. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=311.36s)]
*  No, you cannot. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  You cannot. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=312.8s)]
*  You can't trade Carter. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=313.36s)]
*  Carter cannot be traded this season. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, because he had the extension. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=315.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  So he can't be traded. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=317.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=319.04s)]
*  What do you think, Sarudy? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=320.8s)]
*  I think about it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=322.56s)]
*  I mean, I've been one of the. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=323.6s)]
*  I feel like you, like, I feel like you, when we were in Denver, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  that we were talking about that I was like the king of the like, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=329.44s)]
*  yeah, Lakers should trade AD. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=331.6s)]
*  Like, what's the point? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=332.8s)]
*  Like, get what you can get for him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=333.6s)]
*  I never even thought of this as a possibility. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=335.04s)]
*  I mean, it's not really what they need, but just imagine that team. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=336.72s)]
*  Like that could that has like all time defensive capabilities. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  That would be absurd. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, just go all in on your identity. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=344.72s)]
*  I'd be a little bit worried about, you know, I don't know. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=347.04s)]
*  He just, the injury concerns and the age profile stuff, but it would be kind of fun. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=349.44s)]
*  So you'd have to do 25, 27, 29 and 31. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=354.8s)]
*  I think you'd have to do four unprotected first. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=359.36s)]
*  Probably throw in the Denver first that you have that's rolls over and then maybe a swap. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=362.16s)]
*  The company only, how many picks is that? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=367.76s)]
*  Ko see that? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you just listen to five, six. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you want to give all those picks for AD? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  I think, I think that's where I say no, I think that's where I say no, because I don't know. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=376.32s)]
*  You know, is, is the timeline right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=380.16s)]
*  Like when in two years, like they're not winning these this year. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=382.56s)]
*  I mean, maybe next year they could be a top three team. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=385.68s)]
*  I mean, let's see about the health situation, but like it's like, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=388.0s)]
*  like it feels like they're going in completely opposite directions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  It has details. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=394.32s)]
*  Can I pause button you right now? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=395.2s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  You'd have a starting front line of AD, Palo and Franz. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=397.28s)]
*  The timeline is like now when all those guys come back, I don't want to play that team. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=402.4s)]
*  You're right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=407.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't want to see that team in a playoff series. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=407.44s)]
*  The timeline is this year to do that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=408.88s)]
*  I want to do it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=412.32s)]
*  But if it doesn't work out, you're kind of screwed, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=412.96s)]
*  I want to do it for all those picks. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  I'd be cheap. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd be cheap there if I'm the magic like 80s, 31 right now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=419.68s)]
*  He's got four years left until he's 34, 35 years old. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=422.96s)]
*  And he's going to be making almost $60 million the next three years. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=427.68s)]
*  KOC, this is the part where I remind you that the next traded five first round picks for [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=431.12s)]
*  McHale Bridges. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=435.12s)]
*  I know Davis is like the 11th best guy in the league. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=436.56s)]
*  I know that's the bar. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=440.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think it has to be five picks. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  I think I'd say no. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=445.52s)]
*  I think I'm saying. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=447.36s)]
*  And just wait for something else to happen. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=447.92s)]
*  Because here's the one thing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=451.04s)]
*  So Rudy, right? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=453.2s)]
*  What is that next thing? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=454.72s)]
*  Because you're right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=455.92s)]
*  But let's say there's a player that anytime a player that becomes available who's better [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=457.04s)]
*  than AD, it's going to be Utah or the Thunder or the Spurs, the Rockets, the Nets, these [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=460.72s)]
*  teams that have more picks and quantity and quality like the Magic. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=469.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=472.72s)]
*  The Rockets can trade from this summer. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=473.04s)]
*  They were shagging and a bunch of stuff and go get them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=474.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=478.32s)]
*  So all these other teams have more quantity and quality that the Magic can't wait for [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=478.8s)]
*  that top five guys. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=482.8s)]
*  They're jumping the line and grabbing them now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=485.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  But I think I'm OK long term with like, you know, let those guys go big fish hunting and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=488.56s)]
*  we'll just make moves around the edges and kind of like because you got the two guys, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=494.72s)]
*  you've got the guys that matter, you know, like I. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=498.32s)]
*  So I don't I just disagree with you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=503.44s)]
*  It would be a better case if you were like, I'm not sure we should trade for Anthony Davis, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=505.6s)]
*  who is super injury prone during the year that Palo and Franz both suffered the exact [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  same injury and Mo Vondre got hurt and Suggs got hurt. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=515.84s)]
*  We do not we do not want to bring our comments to carbon to Anthony Davis. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=519.12s)]
*  Make sure the obliques are iced up for every game. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=522.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=526.24s)]
*  What's Anthony Davis's oblique situation? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=526.4s)]
*  Is it OK? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=528.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=529.12s)]
*  I didn't know NBA players hurt obliques until. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=530.72s)]
*  He like strains it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=532.24s)]
*  Orlando is the only other one I went through everybody else. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=533.28s)]
*  I just you know, there's like Sacramento, if you could do like a sub bonus Davis like that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=536.0s)]
*  But I don't know where that gets either team, you know, I think it's like I like the Golden [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=541.6s)]
*  State one. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  It just feels it feels like that's a that's a timeline match thing that that just kind [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=547.6s)]
*  of works out. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=551.76s)]
*  I will say this that trade I laid out, if that actually happened, would be one of the most [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  fun trade moments of the 21st century. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  There's so much going on in that trade. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=559.52s)]
*  In all different directions that we it just feels like we would talk about that for 10 [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=561.84s)]
*  10 straight days. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=566.24s)]
*  Thanks to Rudy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=568.6400000000001s)]
*  Rudy. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=569.2s)]
*  That 81 has me thinking, though, I'm because for the Lakers, Bill, you're right. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=570.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think they're going to necessarily go the other way that you're proposing, but [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  it's something they should at least think about. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=580.48s)]
*  Like this week, I made the case writing like the Warriors should blow it up because they're [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=582.08s)]
*  not going anywhere. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=586.08s)]
*  That's declining. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=587.28s)]
*  Draymond's declining. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=588.48s)]
*  At least they're showing signs of it this year. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  Reminds me of the the 2012 13 Celtics when KG and Pierce was still really good, but but [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=591.12s)]
*  they clearly were beginning to fall a little bit and they make the deal that leads to Tatum [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=596.48s)]
*  and Brown. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=601.04s)]
*  And so I think the Warriors are in that spot where at least the front office and ownership [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  should be thinking about it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=606.0s)]
*  And for the Lakers, obviously, LeBron, I mean, LeBron's not the same guy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=607.36s)]
*  He's just not. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=611.12s)]
*  He's still a great player, but he's not the same guy. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=611.68s)]
*  He's just not. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  He's still a great player, but he's not the same level player and AD. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=614.88s)]
*  Who knows when the injuries will start perking back up again, so they should think about [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=618.48s)]
*  it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=622.0s)]
*  I just think that Lakers roster is still worth at least exploring, adding more. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  But if the magic call up and offer you four firsts and two swaps, you got to take that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=627.92s)]
*  meeting and really think hard about it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=633.76s)]
*  Because if you do that, then that opens up your ability to say, oh, guess what? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=635.6s)]
*  We are open to LeBron trades. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  And then if you were to get something for LeBron, too, suddenly you'd have the most [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=641.76s)]
*  picks in the NBA. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=644.72s)]
*  And then you're going to have contenders. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  How many contenders teams that actually have a chance to win the title or a realistic option [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=648.88s)]
*  for a 40 year old guy making 50 million a year with no trade clause? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=654.64s)]
*  I can't find a single team. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=657.68s)]
*  Even if you said like, oh, Cleveland, he wants to come back home. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=659.28s)]
*  And it's like, if I'm Cleveland, do I want to? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=663.04s)]
*  That's a pretty aggressive reshaking of the roster. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=665.2s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=669.52s)]
*  I want to do it without LeBron if I'm Cleveland. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=670.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=673.52s)]
*  Well, also, like you have such a good thing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=674.08s)]
*  Now you're bringing somebody who, you know, the two generations of guys in the league [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  like Revere, it's really hard for him to be like, all right, just set some picks and hit [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=681.84s)]
*  a couple of corner threes for us. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=686.16s)]
*  Like he's going to have the ball. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=687.36s)]
*  I don't know what the team is for him. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=689.76s)]
*  So and I don't think he wants to leave anyway. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=691.2s)]
*  So it's not realistic. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=693.92s)]
*  Davis as a trade is more realistic to me, but I just don't the Lakers organization. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=695.04s)]
*  I don't understand why they kowtow to these guys. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=702.0s)]
*  Maybe the sons for LeBron, somebody like that short flight away from LA instead of Jimmy Butler. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=704.8s)]
*  Now the Lakers are taking Beal. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=712.0s)]
*  Like they don't want, I don't want to turn LeBron into Beal. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=713.52s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  Also, like if you're the Lakers and you trade LeBron, all of a sudden your games, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  like if you're going to actually rebuild or you're going to like blow it up or whatever, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=722.24s)]
*  like, like there is still people go to the games to see LeBron is one of the greatest [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=727.04s)]
*  players in the history of the league. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  Like that's still a draw and they're still in this mix where they seem relevant. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=732.96s)]
*  People don't actually watch basketball that much think they're still a contender. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=737.2s)]
*  And there's an illusion of competitiveness that is to me, not real, but you at least have that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=741.12s)]
*  Once you, once you start blowing this up, now you're where you were in the mid 2010s. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=748.64s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=753.1199999999999s)]
*  Is that because of LeBron not being top two, top three anymore? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=753.92s)]
*  Is that why, or is that more something about the supporting cast? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=758.2399999999999s)]
*  Like why do you think that is? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=762.0s)]
*  Well, he's, I mean, he's 40. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  He's not the, not close to being the same guy that he used to be. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=765.5999999999999s)]
*  Still one of the 10 to 15 best guys, 80 you said 11th best or something like that. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=768.88s)]
*  So if you still have two top guys. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=773.5999999999999s)]
*  But LeBron doesn't play defense anymore. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=774.8s)]
*  I don't understand how anyone could put him in the top 12 to 15 at this point. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=776.4s)]
*  So you don't have them up there. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=781.28s)]
*  I don't, I don't. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=782.72s)]
*  I would have them in the top 25, but I think, I think it's really hard to, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=784.0s)]
*  to beat good teams when you have multiple holes on defense. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=789.04s)]
*  Like they have, I think that's a fair statement. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=793.28s)]
*  Like when they have, they're playing Reeves and connect and LeBron all at the same time. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=795.68s)]
*  It's like, you can't play defense that way. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=800.4s)]
*  So, and I'm not, what position is the perfect position for him? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  Ideally, right? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=806.56s)]
*  It's the four. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=807.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=808.0s)]
*  Point forward. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=809.12s)]
*  And then you have Rui playing with him. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  Really you want to have perimeter guys and you want shooting, but that would mean LeBron [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  would have to guard bigger guys and rebound more and, and, you know, step up on that. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=817.92s)]
*  And it just doesn't seem like he has enough in the tank to do that anymore. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=823.12s)]
*  So they're in a weird conundrum with him because he gets his stats. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=827.04s)]
*  You can catch the right night. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=829.84s)]
*  He looks great. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=830.96s)]
*  But I don't see it night to night. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=831.76s)]
*  And we get to the playoffs. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=833.92s)]
*  It's every other game, you know? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=834.96s)]
*  So if, like, if I was the Lakers advisor, would either of us say like, you guys have [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  a chance to make the finals with this team, you're one move away? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=840.96s)]
*  I don't think they are. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=844.4s)]
*  They're two moves away from at least having a chance. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=845.68s)]
*  Everyone's two moves away. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=849.2s)]
*  Exactly why it's difficult for them. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=851.52s)]
*  They're two moves away from having a chance. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=853.84s)]
*  And even then they're still not the favorite. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm still not taking them in a series against OKC or Denver. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=857.2s)]
*  I still think they're probably a second round out. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=860.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=863.3599999999999s)]
*  Even if they do get Levine, even if they do get Kessler. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=863.5999999999999s)]
*  But you'd have a better shot in that scenario. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=866.8s)]
*  But I still want to pick them for all the reasons we're talking about. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=869.5999999999999s)]
*  You would need so much luck with you. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=871.76s)]
*  You'd need an OKC injury. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  You'd need something weird to happen with. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=875.12s)]
*  You'd have to go down and there would have to be a dumb thing that happened with every team. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=876.4799999999999s)]
*  I just think. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=881.12s)]
*  And it can happen that, like, the Warriors had a pretty good path in 2022. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=881.92s)]
*  And like Kerr talked about recently and they they win it all. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=886.24s)]
*  Like it's not impossible to happen. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=889.9200000000001s)]
*  So that's what they know. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  Way. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=894.32s)]
*  But I do think, you know, if a team calls up for AD, it makes a significant offer. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=894.48s)]
*  They need to be thinking about that. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=898.96s)]
*  They have to. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm6k79P13I&t=900.1600000000001s)]
