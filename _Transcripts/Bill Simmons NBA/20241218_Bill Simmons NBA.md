# Who Needs Jimmy Butler the Most? With Chris Mannix  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG1m_IJk6ug)
*  What's the big buzz? What are all the kids talking about?
*  Well, the NBA really wants you to care about the NBA Cup. That's for sure. We'll see how much
*  that sticks. But really, when you talk to people with different teams, the buzz nowadays is Jimmy
*  Butler. And what exactly is going to happen down there in Miami? It's pretty clear at this point
*  that there'll be a few teams that express some level of interest in Jimmy Butler. And now I
*  think the question is, what kind of motivation does Miami have to do a deal here? Miami's playing
*  some pretty good basketball. Jimmy just went for 35 the other night. And we know that he...
*  They just believe when they get to the playoffs, they can beat anybody. And they've got a decent
*  track record of... Well, in 2022, they did. Right? It's not happening this year.
*  Probably not. No, I agree with you. And if you look at their roster, Jimmy doesn't fit the timeline.
*  Everybody, including Bam Adebayo, is 27 and younger. So you figure the Heat would have to
*  get motivated to do a deal. The question is, when, who's going to be on the table, what kind of offers
*  are there? That's really the most interesting thing, I think, in the league right now.
*  So I watched the fourth quarter in OT of the game last night against Detroit that they
*  ended up losing in OT. He was incredible in that game. I think he had like a 35, 19, and 12,
*  something like that. But it looked like Playoff Jimmy was really trying hard. That team has a
*  weird identity issue with Hero, who's been excellent. And it seems like over and over again,
*  at the end of games, it's just these Hero 27 footers or Butler. Bam's not involved really at all.
*  And it's just a weird team to watch. It's not a team that's going to win four straight
*  playoff rounds. But it seems like to me, we've seen this go a couple different ways with the
*  guy who maybe doesn't want to be there anymore. He's going to be a phrasian at the end of the year.
*  Maybe he's not happy the team didn't give him an extension. He seems like he's moved toward the,
*  I'm actually mad I didn't get the extension and now I'm leaving after the year. I'm going to show
*  everybody how awesome I am. And to me, I said this on the pod the other day, Houston's the team.
*  Can you watch Houston? Were you there for the NBA Cup semifinals?
*  I was not at that game. No. But I do think, Bill, Houston, they doth protest too much about how
*  they're going to keep this team together. Right? Like every time you see like a quote from Raphael
*  Stone or some reporting coming out of Houston, it's we want to keep this team together and see
*  what it has. And I get that. I understand wanting to see how a young team fits over 82 games,
*  how a young team plays in the postseason and kind of using that as a data point to build off of
*  it. But if you have a chance to supercharge your roster with a defensive minded veteran that would
*  fit in pretty well, I think an Eme Udoka system and his culture, I think you've got to at least
*  take a swing. Well, and the other big part is an end of the game guy, which they don't have.
*  They, you really feel it. Like they have no chance in an OKC playoff series. They're just not going
*  to be able to get shots in one. OKC just strangled them. You know, it's like we're going to talk
*  boxing later. It was like watching the boxer who just doesn't let the other guy breathe. And the
*  guy just is trapped in the corner against the ropes, just just trying to hang on. That's how
*  I felt watching them offensively. Shen Goons, probably the safest bet. I don't trust any of
*  their perimeter guys and they don't have that one guy who's like, all right, one point game,
*  three minutes left, like kind of take us home. They go to Fred Van Vliet. I don't trust Jalen
*  Green at all. Like you go on down the line, but I like a lot of their players and I do think they
*  have an identity. And what's interesting is he fits in with the identity so perfectly. So I was
*  saying a couple of days ago about Butler with Roger and then Van Vliet's expirings in there
*  and you load it with, you know, guys to make that they have a bunch of expirings to make it work.
*  And then they have picks. And for Miami, it's just a reboot. They get calf space this summer.
*  Nobody has calf space this summer. It's one of the crazy things. Like, yeah. And one other team,
*  right. It's like Washington or say there's, I think there's only two teams with 30 million and up.
*  Miami could rig this. So all of a sudden they could have the most calf space and be to me,
*  it's a reboot destination. All of a sudden next year, they're a different team and a little more
*  dangerous. And we've seen them do this multiple times in the last 20 years, right? Where it seems
*  bleak. Then all of a sudden they're, they're back. So I'm working under the assumption they're trading
*  them. You don't think they would possibly think that they could beat the Celtics and the Cavaliers
*  and OKC. I just can't believe they would think that. I think they could, they probably think they
*  could be competitive with Cleveland because there are things you can exploit against the Cavs in a
*  seven game series. They can't believe they're on Boston's level, that they're not. And that's
*  really the bar, right? Like they could look as of right now today, they could extend Jimmy Butler.
*  They can give him two years, buck 13. Like you've got to think till June 30th to do that. If you
*  really want it to, they don't want to. You know, he's 35 years old and no matter how he's playing
*  right now, like the idea of attacking two more years on to, to that option year, it doesn't make
*  any sense to them. And I get that. Like how many teams over the last 12 months have hand out
*  extensions they wish they didn't, right? Like Denver and Jamal Murray, the Sixers and Joel Embiid even.
*  Like you don't even, that's the number of an extension to be trying to be nice. I was trying
*  to be nice. Like Embiid at least has like an MVP track record. Murray had never even been an All-Star.
*  Like he was coming off that absolute crap of a, of a Olympic run. Like there was, those guys are
*  just examples of, of guys you give extensions to way too early. Miami, they're on a different path
*  here. Jimmy's not going to be on it. I think my question would be Bill is if like, like the draft
*  capital move is probably the right way to go. The expiring contract is probably the right way to go.
*  Reboot, use that cap flexibility. But can you get interested in Michael Porter Jr. If that's a deal
*  with Denver? Like I saw you had that last week. I was a Yolkage guy. I loved it. And I was trying
*  to talk myself into it, but I, that can't be the centerpiece. I mean, you don't think that do you?
*  Is Porter the centerpiece of a Butler trade? I mean, he's such a good offensive player.
*  And I just think in that Miami system, you could unlock even more in them.
*  But now I don't have cap space next year. I do that. I'm committed to those three guys.
*  You're throwing out your cap flexibility stuff. You're going, you know, two more years at big
*  number for Michael Porter Jr. After this year. Yeah. Yeah. After this year. Right. It's a tough call.
*  I just, I love his offensive dynamic. Just everything he can do offensively. I love,
*  and he's kind of shaken off the injury bug from the last couple of years. Yeah. I just,
*  he kind of fits the timeline too. What is he like 25, 26 years old? All of a sudden
*  you're adding MPJ in with all these young guys throw Jaime Hockes into that mix. You've,
*  you're good. Can you, I guess, can you get something better than Porter Jr. and free agency?
*  It would be kind of my question over the next couple of summers. I don't know the answer to that.
*  You know, who'd root for that trade is the Celtics because they'd be like, oh wait,
*  you're going to have Porter and hero and the same team in crunch time. This is great. It's like,
*  all you can eat for who we're going to attack. I'm with you in the sense that I do like Porter
*  as an asset a little more than I think other people, the contract, the back issues, like there's,
*  there's real things to be scared about. Like the defense, the fact that he's been replaced during
*  games and crunch time for Russell Westbrook for defensive purposes. Like there's red flags.
*  I love that he's played with the Oakage for this long because that's like getting your fucking
*  masters for how to play basketball. Right. There does seem like there's more there offensively,
*  but to me that's a guy I, I like, I'm looking at a team like Brooklyn or some of the other like
*  Eastern conference also rants. And if you're looking at Porter thinking like, you know what,
*  this is a guy who might be a 25 point game, point of game score on a different team, you know,
*  right now he's in the corner a lot, or he's like just trying to play.
*  Yoke edge and Murray are running everything. So what might that look like on a crappier team?
*  What could that look like on like the pistons with what we watched, you know,
*  what Tim Hardaway and Beasley are doing and then that and Tobias Harris are doing that kind of
*  shooting forward spot. What if you put Porter in there? So, yeah, listen, I would love to see
*  Denver somehow improve this. I just don't know. I don't think Porter is enough to get somebody
*  like Butler and then Golden State feels like they shot their wad with the mountain thing. Now they
*  can't put the salaries together. Yeah. Well, you can still, I guess,
*  rules wise, put Schroeder into a deal and I don't know who's going to want Schroeder on the expiring.
*  And they've got some, the problem with Denver is they have no draft capital, right? Like you'd have
*  to throw like Zeke Naji into that and hope somebody wants him. But man, you watch them and I've watched
*  a lot of them the last couple of weeks, like they need something, like they need somebody with an
*  edge. They need somebody to bring some energy to that team. I know Murray's had a good couple of
*  games like 48 over the last two, but he looks awful. His shooting numbers are all down.
*  Jokic, I mean, I don't want to dump on the guy because he's having a ridiculous offensive season,
*  but defensively he's terrible, right? And that's a big reason why they've sunk as far as they have
*  defensively. So they just need an infusion of something if they're going to maximize
*  these last, not last, but these few years of Jokic playing at an MVP level. And I don't know if
*  Butler's the guy, cause all of a sudden you can't shoot at multiple positions, but his edge and his
*  like the way he plays, I think that would be something that Denver needs.
*  RG He's certainly the most fun for the playoff front. I can't believe you said Jokic's defense
*  was terrible. That really hurt my feelings as a number one Jokic lover. Cause it's conditionally
*  terrible. Cause he's got great hands. He's jumping passing lanes. He gets steals. Like he's very
*  active. He's good at breaking two on ones. There's things he does well, but then you watch a game
*  like the Kings last night where they're just getting basically whatever they want. And you know,
*  his lack of rim protection becomes more of a problem. Well, this is, this is the problem.
*  Well, among the problems. And I was talking to, to an assistant coach that, that went up against
*  him in the last couple of weeks. And you know, part of it is Michael Malone is just running him
*  out there for like 38 minutes a game. Cause it has to. If you're carrying that heavy and offensive
*  burden, it's going to cost you something on the other end, no matter who you are. And I think it's
*  costing him there. The other thing I keep hearing in, and I haven't been around him personally enough
*  to see it, but people keep saying he's heavy, right? Like he's not in, in the kind of shape you've
*  seen him in in years past. And all those things have caused him to go from being a guy that people
*  saw trending towards like an average to good defender. Like he's never going to be elite,
*  but an average to good defender to now he's kind of taken a step back into that, that below average
*  defensive range. And look, it doesn't really matter for their purposes. Cause he is so
*  dynamic offensively, but you know, you look at their defensive problems and some of them are
*  solved with Aaron Gordon back in the mix, but Yocic, Murray getting killed on the point of attack.
*  Some of the guys off the bench, not delivering, they're not good defensive team for all those
*  reasons. Well, and I think that the too many minutes thing is a big problem too. Is there,
*  is there any other Butler team? Because you, you threw out Denver the other day, Golden State
*  and Houston were the two I was focusing on in the content I did. Is there, is there anybody else
*  we're not thinking of? Cause it doesn't seem like there is. How many times, but do you, do you, I
*  get amused by how many times I keep hearing Phoenix throwing this discussion. Like it makes any sense
*  for anybody to do a deal like that. Like Phoenix would have to trade Bradley Beal and Miami would
*  have to want Bradley Beal. I don't know why Miami. And he would have to waive a no trade clause and
*  he's not Bradley Beal anymore. Like he's, if it was three years ago, Bradley Beal,
*  I guess we could talk about it, but not the guy now. I don't, it doesn't seem like he can play for
*  three straight weeks. No, I see a lot of, of just, you know, going down through Hoopsiope. It's like
*  Phoenix interested in Jimmy Butler. Dallas too. That's another one. Like that's not going to happen.
*  No, I mean, I could see Golden State taking a swing. Like Golden State and Denver are the two
*  teams that probably aren't all that concerned about, you know, Jimmy Butler next year. It's
*  all about this year. You want to maximize a window. And if Golden State can get him for
*  some combination of Andrew Wiggins and Brandon Pajemski, then you'd probably jump at that.
*  If you're the Warriors and if Denver can get him, you know, just for Michael Porter Jr. and some
*  filler, you'd probably jump at that. If you're, if you're the Nuggets, at least you should, because
*  you're, you're, you're not looking at two, three years down the line. You're looking at now to win
*  something. I thought I was going to, at Thursday, I had the Cam Johnson, Dennis Schroeder,
*  Golden State. I did a whole thing about it. And I really thought that was going to be how it played
*  out. And they ended up, they got Schroeder two days later. They didn't get Cam Johnson. And then
*  they're reporting people were saying they didn't want to put Kaminga on the table
*  in a Cam Johnson trade. I was really surprised by that because the contract that Cam Johnson's on
*  versus what Kaminga is probably going to get and for agency next year, 30 million, I'm guessing
*  Johnson's like at 22. I just rather have Cam Johnson. I think he's a better asset.
*  And I thought if they, and that's why I don't feel like that's dead yet, because I think the more you
*  stare at that, the more you think, ah, Cam Johnson at 22 is just a good asset. That's like, if I was
*  doing like top 30 best contracts in the league for non-rookie contract guys, Cam Johnson's in like
*  the top 12 making 22 a year. So I don't think that's dead yet. Do you think they're holding
*  on to Kaminga though, to see if there's something better out there than Cam Johnson? I think they're
*  holding on. The problem though, you mentioned Schroeder before. I don't know if they can trade
*  him in a trade where he's with other players. Cause it's the trade deadlines early this year.
*  It's like February 6th. So I think the trade they did for Schroeder, it's not in that two month
*  window where then you can repackage the guy for multiple guys. I think that's, did they change
*  the rule for that? I'm not smart enough to remember all the new rules there, but I do think
*  from what I heard coming out of this was that they can package Schroeder as for another deal.
*  So it's basically your, it's the same contract as D'Anthony Melk. The second round capital,
*  they swapped means nothing. Well, that's great then. So then, so they could do Kaminga, Wiggins,
*  Schroeder, and they'd have to send, find a fourth guy somewhere like Pudzemsky,
*  who I think they overvalued over the summer. I think it was one of the lessons of the summer
*  that was basically untouchable. And he's just been really bad this year, not totally his fault.
*  He's playing out of position, but he hasn't been good. I think low thirties from three point range.
*  He's, he's really cratered. And that's, Schroeder is interesting. I mean, if he gets traded again,
*  whether it be nine teams in eight years, why do you think it didn't work for him in Boston?
*  Cause this version of Schroeder now I really like, but in Boston, it just didn't work.
*  Yeah. I, I, it's probably more to do with style of play. I don't really remember
*  all the, I don't think there were any issues in the locker room. He had some of those early
*  in his career, but I think he's moved past them. Yeah. It seemed like they liked them.
*  Yeah. And getting moved from Brooklyn is more about like, Hey, we want a guy that can't play
*  more than we want a guy that can. So I don't know, but you know, he offensively, I think he's going
*  to help the Warriors to bring it full circle. Like in the short term, I think having another ball
*  handler is good. Having another score is good. A guy that can make shots in clutch situations,
*  obviously, you know, Kerr likes him. I think he's going to help, but I don't think he's
*  untouchable over these next couple of months either. I really like them too. Cause competitive,
*  a good defensive player, like just feisty. So the feistiness now you have him and you have Draymond
*  and, uh, Camiga gets a little feisty sometimes. Curry talk shit. Like there's a little more of
*  an identity with the team. The only other Butler I was looking at and trying to figure out any way
*  was the Cavs. Just is, is that even, does that even make sense? Do they have the contracts?
*  I just couldn't figure it out. And I'm not confident that they would do anything major
*  anyway, cause they have great chemistry right now. And I don't think you'd want to fuck with that.
*  Don't yeah. The, the cabs to me, they've got great, they're a great regular season team,
*  right? Like they're built to win a whole bunch of regular season games because they'll play 11 guys
*  and that's awesome. And in the regular season, but that's not really consequential in the playoffs.
*  I love Mitchell and Garland right now, but smallish guards in the postseason can get
*  exploited. We've seen it happen even in Cleveland before. So, you know, any deal with Butler and,
*  and Cleveland would have to, I assume involve Garland. Do you want Garland if you're Miami?
*  Does that make any sense that you brought up defensive issues with hero and Porter? It's the
*  same kind of situation. If you bring Garland into that mix, I don't know. Uh, I don't, if I'm,
*  I don't think that's the move if, if I'm Cleveland, but I, I don't know that I'd make Cleveland a
*  threat to Boston yet either, despite the fact that played really well against them in those two games.
*  Let me ask you if salaries, if you could throw out salaries when you made trades,
*  do you think the Celtics would trade Peyton Pritchard straight up for Giannis?
*  I mean, yes, but the fact that we're even asking that question,
*  how about Peyton Pritchard for Jimmy Butler?
*  I don't know, man. This is an unbelievable season that he's having. I mean, this is beyond six man
*  of the year. Like his per 36 stats now are nuts. Shitting stats are nuts. He's in the running for
*  one of the best six man seasons anyone's had since like John Havlicek for the Celtics. I
*  can't believe what I'm watching. The short answer to Pritchard for Butler is I think Boston would
*  say no, because Butler doesn't shoot threes. If you play for the Celtics, you have to shoot at
*  least eight threes a game to, or be able to, to do. I mean, he's, he's been awesome. And what a
*  contract he's on too. Like you'd have to, you couldn't do a Butler deal because Butler's making
*  like what 46 million and Peyton's making eight. So you can't even, you can barely put him in any
*  trade. I would say if you're doing best contracts in the league, he's gotta be in like the top three.
*  He might even be number one. He's six man of the year at 7 million bucks and also gives them the
*  luxury of like, oh, Derek White's a little banged up tonight. We'll just play Pritchard. He'll score
*  29 in the starting spot. It's, it's really great. I mean, the, the ceiling of this regular season
*  Celtics team, when everybody's back, I do feel like they have like a 16, 18 game winning streak
*  in there somewhere before the season ends. Can you think of a player, I can't think of a player
*  that's had the kind of like three year stretch of Peyton Pritchard where it's like, he's not playing
*  Joe Mazzulli, doesn't like him. He wants to be traded. All of a sudden he's getting opportunity
*  and now he's in the sixth man of the year. I'm sure guys have had these, this kind of roller
*  coaster ride, but I haven't seen one like Peyton Pritchard to get to this level. You'd said a couple
*  of years ago, this was where we, what we'd be talking about with Peyton Pritchard, where would
*  you trade him for Giannis or Jimmy Butler? Well, I know it's for jokes, but yeah. I know, I know,
*  but no, I don't think Butler's a joke. I wouldn't trade him for Jimmy Butler. I mean, it's going to
*  come off crazy, but like Peyton Pritchard fits what this team is doing. Peyton Pritchard can come off
*  the bench and knock down, you know, six threes, two of them at the buzzer. Like he's, he's, he's
*  just the perfect fit for what they want to do. Yeah. If you're talking 7 million for Peyton Pritchard
*  or 48 for Jimmy Butler, I think for the way this Celtics team's constructed, it is, it's, it really
*  feels like you see this happen sometimes in basketball and in football and baseball and boxing.
*  It seems like the game slowed down for him a little bit. He'll have these moments where
*  all of a sudden he's doing old man post-up plays on shorter guards. He's around the rim. He's like,
*  I'm going to do old man, pick up basketball and just like shoot a jump hook over this guy. It's
*  been really impressive to watch. Speaking of boxing, big fight this weekend. My guy who I bet on
*  every time he fights, I just parlay him with football teams. Usyk is the rematch against
*  Fury. Usyk's never lost. Everybody's been looking forward to this fight.
*  Is it, is this T to you, is this a, will he finally get the credit he deserves as a main draw fight
*  or is this a, what does Tyson Fury have left fight? I think it's more of a, what does Tyson Fury
*  have left fight? I do think that for a broader audience, Usyk is, you know, getting some of the
*  credit that he deserved back at Cruiserweight when he became the first ever undisputed champion
*  in the four belt era, comes to heavyweight, beats AJ, your guy twice. My guy, my guy who no matter
*  where I bet, I lose. Four against, I'm like oh for my last six. I get a text from you every time
*  Anthony Joshua fights and it's usually like, I can't believe I bet on that guy. That's more,
*  I can't believe I didn't bet on him or whatever. Yeah. Every time. Yeah. I think as much as
*  he is getting some of the exposure that he deserves and I had like a two hour conversation with him
*  last month for a story that's coming out on Friday. He's really a remarkable guy with a
*  remarkable backstory. This is more about Tyson Fury and what does Tyson Fury have left in the
*  tank? I mean, he has overcome a ton of stuff over the last 10 years, you know, whether it's
*  off the outside the ring issues, weight issues, depression issues,
*  coming back from tough fights, you know, a whole bunch of different things. He's never had to come
*  off a loss before. And I talked to Tyson for a while last week. I've watched a lot of clips of
*  him over the last couple of weeks. And I do wonder kind of what is his mindset coming into this fight?
*  Like how, how much does he have left at 36 years old, which is chronologically younger, but Augs and
*  Usyk, but he's been through physically and perhaps mentally so much more. I mean, I saw an interview
*  Tyson did this week where he said that he hasn't talked to his wife, Paris in three months, like
*  didn't really elaborate on that, but said he hadn't talked to his wife in three months. And I'm
*  watching the interview. I'm like, what? Like this, this is a big family. They were on that Netflix
*  series. Like they are intertwined. Those two hasn't talked to her in three months. Now, maybe it's
*  because, Hey, I'm just totally locked in. I don't know if I buy that, but I'm wondering what Fury has
*  left here because if you're not a hundred percent, if you don't have your A game, Usyk is going to
*  beat you. I think Usyk is a generational great. You know, I think he's one of those rare guys
*  that only come along once every 20, 25 years that are so skilled, so strong. Doesn't matter what
*  weight class you put him in. He's going to dominate big guys, small guys. He's going to beat you
*  with his discipline and with his game plan. If you don't have everything going for you the right way,
*  you're going to get beaten. And that I'm not so sure about with Tyson Fury.
*  Well, the interesting thing about the first fight is the scorecards had it closer than I think I
*  had it in my head when I was watching. I mean, Fury almost got knocked out. It seemed like it was
*  a wrap and he really got the shit kicked out of him. I think it was the ninth round. And then
*  kind of right. He definitely won the 12th round. The 11th round. I remember two of the judges gave
*  it to him. One judge didn't, which was super suspicious. But I don't know. It was a split
*  decision, but it really wasn't like, I don't think anybody watching that fight thought,
*  Oh, I wonder who won. Fury's face looked worse. Everything looked worse. I just think Usyk reminds
*  me so much of Pereira in the UFC where it's just watch him. You're like, I don't know what the
*  answer is to try to beat this guy. At least in UFC, you could try to take the guy down and get
*  him on the ground. With Usyk, I almost feel like it's got to be somebody like Picoli just
*  overpowering him and using like a huge size. You know, I'd bring Picoli up. It's just a huge size
*  disadvantage because he is like a blown up cruiserweight and maybe that's how to beat him.
*  I just don't see Fury doing it. You got to, first of all, at some point you should sit down with
*  Picoli because he's an incredibly engaging guy and I know you love him. He's interesting. Usyk
*  would beat Picoli 12 zip by the way. Like Usyk would not make the same mistakes Jared Anderson
*  made and stay within range of that right hand. He would just be zipping around him using feints
*  inside, outside. How dare you disparage Picoli? There's a lot of guys I want to see Picoli fight.
*  He's a really funny guy. But here's the thing, nobody wants to fight Picoli. He couldn't even
*  get on the February 22nd card. They had to like push him to the next card, but he was supposed to,
*  I mean it seemed like Dubois was going to be the natural whatever. He didn't want to fight him.
*  He just wanted to fight Joe Parker. Dubois does not want to fight Martin Picoli. Not with,
*  like Dubois sitting out there going like, all right, there's maybe a rematch with AJ,
*  which is worth eight figures. There's maybe a unification fight with the winner of Fury
*  and Usyk that could be worth eight figures. I am not getting in the ring with Martin Picoli
*  and risking getting my head taken off. I've already had some issues with knockouts in the past.
*  You're not doing that. So look, Usyk, what I love about Usyk is that he kind of gives away the game
*  plan before every fight. Like when he makes these jokes where he's like, don't be afraid, Tyson,
*  I'm not going to leave you alone. That is him telling you that he's going to be applying
*  pressure all night. And pressure comes in different ways. Like it doesn't have to be this
*  overwhelming, I'm going to put you in a headlock during every round type of pressure that we've
*  seen from some brawlers. It can just be staying in your face and making you keep your hands up
*  at all times and making you stay on your toes at all times. That's exhausting. Like Tyson Fury,
*  I thought won the first half of that fight with Usyk. 4-2 could have been 3-3. But the pressure
*  Usyk put on was overwhelming. And in the ninth round, it got up to him. When Usyk landed that
*  first straight left hand, that was the fight right there. So he's going to do the exact same thing
*  again. And again, it goes back to Fury. If he's not as sharp as he's been at his very best,
*  I think he's going to have a lot of problems in this fight.
*  Usyk has a lot of pieces of things that I've loved from guys in the past.
*  As the fight goes on, it just seems like he shrinks the ring and figures out the exact distance,
*  how to hit the guy with the little tiny punches that don't seem like a big deal. And then they
*  kind of add up. But there's pieces of Hopkins in there. There's pieces of Cesar Chavez in there.
*  There's one fight the first four rounds, and then the fight starts to shift and you can kind of feel
*  it. And I don't really know what the answer is to beating him, but I just know I'm going to be
*  betting on him every time he fights. He's 37. I don't know how many more of these he has left,
*  but I mean, if you look back at his 22 and 0, he beat Joshua twice, beat Dubois, beat Fury already,
*  could be beating him again. He was dominant as a cruiserweight. Go back to the 2012 gold medal in
*  that whole era. He was beating all those guys. And if he wins this, what's next? Because you
*  could fight Dubois and Parker are fighting February 22nd, Soh Jong and Cabell. So maybe
*  it's one of those two. Who's the next fight? It's not going to be AJ who wants nothing to do
*  with Usyk. And AJ to me, they keep talking about if Fury loses, you can make the AJ fight. We
*  didn't just see AJ get clobbered over five rounds today in Dubois. Forget about that that happened.
*  Remember the three in a row AJ won and not that one. So it's not going to be AJ. You beat Fury
*  again. It's not going to be Fury. Dubois would certainly do it. But like, yeah, I mean, I think
*  Usyk, if there was enough money on the table, would certainly fight Dane Dubois again, become
*  undisputed champion once again. There could be like events out there for him. Like everybody in
*  boxing has been trying to find a way to do a fight with Zhai Li Zhang on mainland China. Like the
*  amount of times I've heard about Zhang going back to the bird's nest in Beijing in front of
*  100,000 people, you know, for a while it was Anthony Joshua. Well, hey, it could be
*  Alexander Usyk that fights him there if Zhang can get a win in his next fight. So maybe it's something
*  like that, but he will have quite literally have cleaned out the heavyweight division if he beats
*  Tyson Fury for the second time. Or there'll be guys he hasn't beaten, but beating those two top guys
*  twice. That will be an accomplishment. And you asked me like, how do you beat Usyk? To me,
*  there's only one way to do it. And that's to just apply unrelenting pressure to him, because
*  there have been times where Usyk has been in trouble. Like at Cruiserweight, he had a,
*  I think it was a split decision win over Marius Brides, who's a physical guy at Cruiserweight.
*  The times that AJ had success against him was when he was the one putting pressure. He was the one
*  letting his right hand go. I think it was like the ninth or 10th round of that second fight. We had
*  Usyk in real trouble. Even early on Fury landed some good shots on Usyk, just didn't follow up
*  and chase him down. Go back even further. Derek Chisora, of all people, Derek Chisora might have
*  given Usyk his toughest fight at heavyweight because through six rounds, he was just lumbering
*  after him in that fight. So if you are willing to just go all in and commit on a pressure style,
*  you can have success against Usyk. But if you try to box him, you're going to lose every single time
*  because he is a better boxer than everyone at Cruiserweight and everyone at heavyweight.
*  Which is one of the things that made Fury special was at his size. He was like kind of a
*  sneaky good boxer, but not compared to this good. I'm glad you brought up Chisora. I think he's lost
*  everybody in the division at this point, right? He's still going.
*  Not over yet. So is there a Cruiserweight that could move up?
*  Not. I mean, look, so Gilberto Ramirez is now a unified champion. Gilberto is someone that people
*  in the US know a little bit about. Former champion, 168, title contender at 175, lost to Beeble back
*  in 2022 over at Abu Dhabi. He's a name in that division. And Usyk's fought in the US in the past.
*  That would probably be a pretty big fight if Ramirez wins one or two more fights. The other
*  guy in that division is Jayapataya, who's super athletic, good power at that weight class. Still
*  trying to build a name, I think, that's big enough to get someone like Usyk that's interested. So
*  those are conceivable possible fights, but I would make Usyk a big favorite against both those guys.
*  Usyk too, Bill, the last fight, I forget what his exact weight was, but you could tell that in what
*  was, I think, his fifth fight at heavyweight, he had grown into the weight class. Before he was just
*  going up in weight, and he was like 2'12", 2'13", 2'18", he was solid in the last fight. He is a
*  full-fledged heavyweight right now. And if he takes on a cruiserweight like Ramirez or Apataya coming
*  up, they're going to have problems with his size. So yeah, there are some decent names there, but
*  I would make a threat at this point to Usyk. Yeah. I remember that happened with Holyfield. It took
*  him a couple to feel like he was a heavyweight, and then it happened. Well, on Fandl right now,
*  he's minus 166, Usyk, which I just think is nuts. I don't understand at this point in his career
*  from everything we've seen how he's not minus 250 against everyone else in that division, just blind.
*  There's not one person that he shouldn't be minus 250 against. I worry, Bill, but I worry about some
*  of the... The scorecards were too close last time. Usyk, he needed that knockdown to pull out a
*  decision. There's a lot of money in a trilogy. That's a reality. If Fury wins this whole pile
*  of money, I don't want to do it, but I've seen enough in boxing to wonder what could happen in
*  a circumstance like this. I think Usyk's going to have to win clean. Are you saying boxing gets
*  fishy sometimes? It gets very fishy. It gets very fishy. And I think more importantly, there's some
*  bad judges in boxing, like really bad judges. And judging boxing is hard. I have to do it on an
*  unofficial capacity every week at Dazon, but some strange things happen on scorecards in boxing.
*  And I hope we don't get that in this fight. I hope the right man comes out the winner.
*  Yeah. Probably the maddest people get at you is either something you wrote about LeBron or
*  they didn't like how you scored round four in the third to last fight on a Dazon thing.
*  People just go nuts about the scoring. I'd go nuts watching it. I get so mad.
*  There are people, but it's always on a micro level, right? It's like, I can't believe you
*  scored the fourth round for such and such. I'll go back and rewatch that and I'll re-score it.
*  But it's hard, especially some of these rounds where there's not a ton of action. And I think
*  Usyk Fury, some of those rounds were hard to score, especially in the first half of the fight when
*  there wasn't the kind of obvious action that you saw in the second half. But I mean, I just hope
*  there's no controversy to this one. If Fury wins, great. Let's have a trilogy. I think it'd be
*  awesome. But if Usyk wins, hope he wins clean. Well, the other thing, when you're sitting close,
*  you might miss the biggest punch of the round because the ref blocked you or, you know,
*  it's not an exact science. Before we go, we got to talk about the super card in February 26,
*  or February 22nd. I don't know if there's been a card like this.
*  This, like the third, fourth best fight on this card would be the best fight on a Saturday night.
*  We've talked in the past about how the Saudis and all this overseas money, and they're just like,
*  we want everybody good to fight each other. And that's what we want. And that's,
*  this seems like the full culmination of that. This is one of the best boxing cards of all time.
*  When you saw it all laid out, were you shocked? Like they didn't even have room for Bacoli. They
*  were like, now we're moving you over, moving your fight later. This is one of the, we have
*  super middleweight, lightweight, welterweight, better BF against B-ball, Dubois against Parker,
*  Zhang's fighting Cabell. Like it's a fucking crazy card.
*  It's the deepest card that I've ever seen. You go back to the 1990s and Don King put on some
*  unbelievable pay-per-view cards where they were four fights deep, championship level,
*  high level stuff. We've never had a card that on paper goes seven fights deep with all headliners
*  night after night. And this is, this is an example of the positive impact of the Saudis entry into
*  boxing. What we're going to see in the main event on Saturday is an example. I mean, having
*  two fights between Fury and Usyk in one year is remarkable. Even more remarkable is the headliner
*  of the February 22nd card. I mean, we had to wait six years, six years, both better BF and Bevel
*  were world champions and they didn't fight each other because there's no money in it.
*  Because neither one of them has a real fan base. Saudis come along, they make a fight in October
*  and less than six months later, we're getting the rematch. Like that is, that's, that there's a huge
*  net positive for the Saudis being involved in boxing for boxing. I would say this though,
*  I don't know how necessary it is to have seven fights like this on a card because it's great
*  if you want to watch all seven. If you are a true purist, if you're a diehard, yeah, you sit down at
*  11 o'clock in the morning on the West coast and you're watching, you know, Zhang fight,
*  or you're watching Virgil Ortiz fight. It's great. Like I would, I will spend my entire day,
*  if I'm not there, watching that particular card. But especially in the U S not a lot of people
*  are probably going to do that. And I do think there's something to the idea of spreading the
*  stuff out, right? Like having two or three great fights on a card and then a month, month and a
*  half from then having the other two or three great fights, like having sort of a schedule.
*  During a month. Yeah. So you get these guys.
*  This is UFC though. Like UFC has changed the thinking on this because there'll be some UFC
*  cards that you could watch for five straight hours and they, they kind of want that.
*  Yeah. But UFC is able to do that month after month, right? Like, I don't know what the
*  boxing schedule is after February 22nd. Like there's some fights I'm looking forward to, but
*  you know, nothing with the kind of depth that we're going to see on the 22nd. Like even like
*  Shakur Stevenson Floyd, Schofield is a fun fight that would headline in Newark or in New York,
*  Virgil and Madrimoff good fight in Texas. Like I think it's, look, I'm excited to watch every
*  single one of these fights. I wouldn't argue though, with the idea of like, Hey, let's push
*  a few of them, you know, a month from now and maybe a couple of others. Yeah. Just, just divvy
*  it up. Give these guys a chance for, for a little more exposure. It's great that they're getting the
*  money. Like all these guys are getting paid and in a sport like this, you deserve it. But,
*  I just worry about the exposure of a guy that's going to be fighting at noon Pacific in the U S
*  that's the only thing I would, I would quibble with counter. This is like Thanksgiving. It's like,
*  should we have sweet potatoes and mashed potatoes and stuffing and like, fuck it. Let's just,
*  let's just go for it. To me, this is like a once in a decade kind of card. I don't know if they'll
*  be able to replicate this many fights in a row. I've never seen anything like this where you
*  literally can't miss the first of seven fights. And the best thing is Stevenson who I think is
*  my least favorite good guy to watch. And now he's buried on this card with six other fights. So I
*  don't have to, you know, be like, how do I get it? I don't really like watching this guy. And now
*  it's like, he's just one of the many, but somehow they left out my guy, but Coli. So I have to get,
*  do I have to get the Coli on a podcast? Try to, try to pump them up. What do I need to do?
*  Sean O'Toole I think you should. I think he'd fly to Los Angeles to do it. I mean, he's got like this
*  incredible story where he's from Africa, but he's kind of Scottish now and he's got this great
*  personality that comes with it. And he's been so avoided for, for so many years, just to put a
*  button on the card. It's a great problem to have, right? Like I'm excited about it. I want to see it.
*  Sean O'Toole You're working, right? Are you working it?
*  Sean O'Toole I believe so. They, we haven't figured that out yet, but yeah, I was at the last,
*  better be a B-boy fight. Yeah. It's a great problem to have seven hours of high level boxing is going
*  to be awesome for the boxing fans out there. Like ultimately that's, that's what it comes down to.
*  Sean O'Toole I wonder like this card's so good. I wonder if you almost need two play-by-play guys.
*  I don't, is it too much to ask one play? It's almost like you have to go WWF or they have the
*  two different play-by-play guys for the five hour card. That's like, that's, I don't even know if
*  Gus Johnson would be able to go for seven straight hours with boxing like that.
*  We did that whole Riyadh season card in LA, which I think was like six fights. Like that was a lot of,
*  because that was, you know, that was a pretty deep one. You had, you know, the David Morrell fighting
*  low on that card. You had a pretty good slobber knocker of a fight with Jarell Miller and Andy
*  Ruiz, you know, low on that card. So yeah, it's, it's, these are long days, but they're, if you are
*  like a true purist and someone that just wants to sit down on your couch and is willing to invest
*  seven hours, it's one of the, it'll be one of the better days you'll have.
*  February 22nd, February turning into a surprisingly good sports month. It used to be like the dead
*  month, but now all these different places have figured out like the trade, they moved the trade
*  deadline up somehow against the Superbowl and then a whole bunch of stuff happening.
