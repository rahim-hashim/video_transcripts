# Bill Simmons’s “I Hate to Tell You” NBA Truths | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_NQ3Ngo8NA)
*  All right, let's play the game that I mentioned. It's called I hate to tell you.
*  We're gonna go around the around the uh circles. This will be the last thing we do.
*  Waz, you start us off. It's got to be something NBA related with a setup and then you saying,
*  I hate to tell you, but we're basically breaking bad news to different people in NBA circles.
*  So a couple days ago, a bunch of notable public people, people from the music scene, actors and
*  actresses, a couple of athletes showed up to this thing called the Met Gala and people show up
*  basically to give their their public persona and image a different level of oomph and pizzazz.
*  But Ben Simmons, I gotta tell you,
*  showing up to the Met Gala in that monkey suit, man, that did nothing but drag your reputation
*  down into the mud even further. It's just like, look, you're not doing anything technically wrong
*  by going to the Met Gala and looking like a fool, but like when you don't play and it's for all these
*  lame excuses and when you do play, you're playing horrible and you're extremely overpaid
*  and you make time and effort to show up to the damn Met Gala looking like an idiot.
*  Like this does not help your image, man. Like this does not help your public standing. Like this
*  makes you look worse. I gotta tell you, Ben Simmons.
*  Go ahead, BS. I have a zag on Ben Simmons. No relation to my son. He's made $204 million
*  after next year. I think Ben Simmons is a big winner. He played a couple good years.
*  He never got better at any NBA skill. He got, he forced a trade and doesn't get,
*  doesn't have to play anymore. He basically doesn't have to work. He's going to retire with like a
*  hundred plus million in the bank and he gets to go to the Met Gala and just doesn't seem embarrassed
*  by any of it. I really respect his lack of embarrassment house. This is precisely the
*  observation I want to make. I'm worried that this is one of the last Ben Simmons sightings
*  that we're going to have because he doesn't play basketball and he's only noteworthy for
*  being a basketball player. So he has to find something to keep him in the public eye for us
*  to enjoy the full Simmons experience. But I don't think he has that skill. There's no pivot.
*  I'm afraid he's just going to fade away. The move really for him is to go back to Australia
*  and try to do something for that national team. But he's not doing that. It doesn't seem like it's
*  in the cards because he doesn't play basketball. Once upon a time when it seemed like Ben Simmons
*  was going to be a second team all NBA guy that year, was that 2019, 2020?
*  And I remember thinking like, this might suck for my son. He has the same name as Ben Simmons.
*  Ben Simmons is going to be a really famous basketball player. No longer have those concerns.
*  House. This is my first, I got to tell you. Jimmy Butler.
*  So Pat Riley did his annual 40 minute press conference, which by the way, I think should
*  be a pay-per-view. I think it should be like 29.95. Like I would definitely pay to watch it.
*  I'm always on the edge of my seat at the end of the year when Pat Riley gives, I'll never forget
*  the 10 years ago when he did the winning is hard when he was doing the LeBron pep talk to try to
*  convince LeBron to stay. And he was like sub tweet press conferencing him for 40 minutes.
*  Then LeBron left like three days later. It didn't work. I love his speeches. He killed Jimmy Butler
*  in this thing. And he, he did it perfectly. He talked about how Jimmy, he's great. He's,
*  he had a really good season, but you shouldn't be talking shit from the bench and
*  he's got to play more. And we're not going to talk about an extension with him unless it's tied to
*  him playing more basketball. And really I always call it hit them with the newspaper. Like when,
*  when you're mad at your dog and just hit the dog with the newspaper, just hit them with the
*  newspaper. So then Jimmy, a couple of days later was like, yeah, I didn't take it personally.
*  I want to retire in Miami. This is the last NBA team I'm going to play for.
*  The only other team I'd play for is some team in Brazil. I'd never heard of
*  Jimmy, I hate to tell you, they will absolutely trade your ass at some point over the next six
*  months. If you don't start playing basketball games and showing up every day, they will trade
*  your ass. You have two years left, 48 million, 52 million, and they will trade you. Pat Riley would
*  trade anyone on his team and his family. That guy will do it. He's 79 years old. You think he's going
*  to be like, Oh, wait till I'm 81 to decide if this Jimmy Butler thing where it's like, he will fucking
*  trade you. I wouldn't be surprised if you traded him this summer. Jimmy, don't get too comfortable.
*  That's my any any thoughts before we move to house was on Jimmy. I think I think it wouldn't be
*  shocking if Jimmy Butler's played his last game in Miami. Honestly, I wouldn't surprise me that as
*  well. One bit one bit. I know Pat Riley was like, No, we're not trading them just because we don't
*  we don't have to give him an extension. We're not going to be forced into a trade, blah, blah, blah,
*  blah. But I think they might do it voluntarily. Not that Jimmy Butler was like demanding a trade
*  enforcing his way out of town. I think it's I think it's a strong possibility, especially when
*  you're speaking like that in public. I don't care that Riley's old and he's the godfather, yada,
*  yada, yada. Like you don't come after your guys like that in public, man. Like, like, to me,
*  there was some sign of a strained relationship. Yeah. And also, it's a sign of when somebody's
*  this old, like my dad or house's dad, we're just like, never know what they're gonna say. They
*  might just let it fly. They have some comments and some thoughts. I think the Miami Jimmy Butler
*  situation to me is very similar to just an incredible long blackjack run that they tried
*  to change dealers on you. It didn't work. Then they brought their cooler dealer in that still
*  didn't fucking work. The pit boss walked over. He stared the table down, tried to change the
*  karma. He mentioned how many chips you're up still didn't work. And you have this big pile of
*  chips. And now it's three thirty in the morning and you're drunk. And the dealer hasn't talked to you
*  for an hour and take your chips and go home. That might be what this is with Jimmy Butler. Maybe
*  it's gonna be mid thirties now. How do you have one Jimmy Butler question? I do. I want to know
*  what you guys think is the best place for him to land. Because I think I'm definitely on the same
*  page as you guys in terms of him change the scenery. I know Philly has all that that cap space.
*  Is there is there a deal there? I don't know what Philly has to give back.
*  And it would have to be I keep eyeing the Paul George piece of all this wondering if
*  that could be a Miami basically doing that weird Miami voodoo they do where they started out with
*  Jimmy Butler and somehow end up with Paul George on a new contract. And you're like, wait, how
*  they do that? Whether it's like a sign, a double trade where they trade Butler to Paul George and
*  he moves into the Butler spot or they trade Butler to Philly to create this big trade exception.
*  And then they traded like something like that. I was thinking the only other one is if if there's
*  a LeBron possibility, if he decides he doesn't want to stay in the Lakers. And then the only
*  other one I was thinking was Golden State just for the fucking sport of it.
*  Oh, wait, hit pause on the Lakers. Is the lake what the Lakers give back with those picks? Is
*  that attractive enough to Miami? Or it's just LeBron for Butler.
*  I can't see LeBron playing for Pat Riley again. Me neither. I'm just animosity. Yeah, it seems
*  like there's animosity side. Yeah, because obviously LeBron made up with Dan Gilbert. He just
*  doesn't care if he really wants to change something up. He'll do that. But Pat Riley is
*  just like he was so freaking wounded by the fact that he went to Vegas and it was a fake pitch
*  and blah, blah, blah. And they wasted his time and smiling faces, hidden agendas, all of the crap
*  that he said about Bron. I find it hard to believe. But, you know, I think Jimmy works on any team with
*  actual postseason aspirations. Right. Like I've been hearing Kevin Durant to OKC for the homecoming.
*  I mean, why can't Jimmy be over there? I think Jimmy would be a great OKC edition. Right.
*  I just want to make sure Sarud is still awake. Orlando?
*  Franz? Franz and something else. Maybe Miami can fix Franz. House, what's your next,
*  what's your, I got to tell you. Well, here's the thing. I am. Oh, I hate to tell you. I can't even
*  remember the name of my own good man. I hate to tell you. I am an avid consumer of the BS podcast.
*  I very much enjoyed the recent segment that you and Mr. Rosillo had where you took three teams
*  and were trying to map out what does the future look like for these teams. You did the Suns,
*  you did the Heat and you did the Lakers. And I wondered to myself, well, there's one team that
*  you guys left out. And I wasn't sure why. But I'm looking at Milwaukee and I'm looking at my guy,
*  Janice. And I say, Janice, my freak, my freak, I have to tell you this version of Dave Lillard,
*  Dave Lillard that you just got at age 33. I hate to tell you this. It ain't getting any better.
*  It is age 34 year. And that dude's making 50 million bucks next year. I hate to tell you,
*  three. I hate to tell you freak. So what should they do?
*  You tell me what should they do? I don't know. They're fucked. Miami's fucked. Miami, Milwaukee.
*  Well, Miami might be fucked too. Dame thinks tough because
*  was what do you think is compared to what his trade value was a year ago? Is it 80%?
*  It's definitely way lower. 75%? 60%?
*  The thing is, last year he was coming off the best season of his career.
*  Right. Because he played 50 games and none of them meant anything.
*  Oh, sure. Okay. Sure. That's one way of putting it. Or like, you know, he moved to Milwaukee. He's
*  gone through a lot of things in his personal life, which he's put out in the public with
*  like this divorce and all of this stuff. Like he's had a pretty tough goal of it,
*  like trying to adjust and all of that. I think if he can be between what he was his last year
*  in Portland and what he did this year in Milwaukee, I think that's still pretty damn good.
*  Right. I just think he just had like just a really tough, bad season. And I believe he's
*  capable of playing better. Now, do I think he's able to get to the highest of highs of
*  what Dame Lillard has provided in his career? No, but I think he could be much better with,
*  you know, if they have an actual training camp, they have an actual mode of attack for
*  the kind of team that they want to be. I think the Dame part of this can be better. I think the
*  supporting situation, like actually going into the off season with a plan to get supporting players
*  that can buttress the rest of it is to me the most important.
*  They don't have a lot of moves on that front though. I would be so scared watching,
*  like if we get Minnesota OKC as a Western finals, watching the athleticism in that series,
*  and if I'm Yannis, shout out to Thanassis, by the way, it sounds like he got hurt.
*  Like that guy, torn Achilles. No, it sucks.
*  That was the story I saw today. But if you're Yannis and you're watching OKC Minnesota and
*  watching those guys flying around and then thinking about your old ass team with Jay Crowder,
*  that's pretty rough. Do you have one more I hate to tell you, Wes?
*  Yeah. So in game two at the Garden, Reggie Miller was in the building and the Knicks fans
*  started screaming, fuck you, Reggie, towards the end of the game when the game was in hand.
*  I loved it.
*  He doesn't work for the Pacers. He was just in the building. And I got to tell you,
*  I was into it. We need more teams doing this. If there is a former guy that used to kill you,
*  he might be in the front office of the team you're playing against, or he might be on the
*  broadcast, or he might be an agent now, or a player rep, or whatever. If that dude is in the building,
*  the fans should be chanting that guy's name and cursing him out.
*  The Reggie grudge, 30 years on, it just warmed my heart, man. It was perfection.
*  You know what's funny? I had a bunch of friends at that game and all of them, apparently the fans
*  were just chanting at different points, fuck Trey Young was said a bunch of times apparently.
*  That was a chant. When people were leaving the game, fuck Trey Young started. Trey Young wasn't
*  even involved in this game. So I think the Knicks are just so happy to be in the mix.
*  I had my friend Brian Koppelman I actually talked to today because he called me and he said it was
*  the happiest Knicks night of his entire life. That's amazing. That all the guys there,
*  the Willis moment from Brunson where they think, oh shit, this just evaporated in thin air,
*  the guy's gone, then he comes back, OG gets hurt, they still somehow win, they're up to nothing,
*  and they just love this team. This team, this is such a memorable Knicks team and it ties into
*  what we talked about before with the Celtics. Here's this Knicks team flying around, Josh Hart
*  playing 48 minutes, they're fighting for every fucking, they're coming back from 10,
*  you know, they're playing like their life depends on. Then you watch the Celtics team that
*  couldn't be bothered to defend a high screen.
*  She's trying to get in on the action. She heard this is one of the most popular podcasts in the
*  world and she wanted to get some FaceTime, Bill. I'm with you though, Oz. I love when the playoffs
*  get to the point where just players are in fuck you chance. I have a quick one.
*  Jokic wins the MVP and they interview him on the TNT show, which is always a fun moment,
*  and Shaq decides to start his question with, uh, Jokic, I just gotta tell you that I didn't,
*  I voted for SGA to win MVP. I just wanted you to hear that from me.
*  And it was just like, not even really a question. Jokic is on like a satellite and
*  TNT, I hate to tell you, if Shaq comes up with that idea in the pre-show meeting,
*  it's okay to talk him out of it and veer him in a different direction. Maybe near the end of the
*  interview he could mention, but I don't think people realize how producers can fuck up TV
*  shows like this. Cause then it looks like Shaq's an asshole, right? It's like, man, why did Shaq do
*  that? What a jerk. This is the whole point. This is the talent always goes at these big networks
*  and the producers always stay and the producers are the ones who could talk the talent out of
*  doing something like that and they never do. And then the talent looks like schmucks and then
*  eventually they get replaced. But I just, I didn't like that at all. That should be a happy moment.
*  The guy won the MVP. House, what do you got? Well, that's, that's a bummer because I feel
*  like we're ending on a sad note. I am channeling my inner John Oren from the puck, our boy Johnny
*  O. And I have a little message for David's Asloff. Hey David, you know, you had the tiniest,
*  the tiniest pimp hand ever with an exclusive negotiating period to try and do a deal with
*  the NBA and you fucked this up so royally. I hate to tell you, take a look at the stock
*  price right now, Dave, big Zazz, take a look at the stock price. Cause when you wake up
*  30 days from now and don't have the NBA as part of any of those, the WD package,
*  that stock price is going to be halved. And we're in the single digit dollars, big brother,
*  hate to tell you, you're taking one right up the poop shoot. And it's a giant L my brother.
*  Hate to tell you. Now here's the sad thing. That means almost certainly that inside the NBA,
*  this is it. This is no way. It's fine. So who's going to do it? It's fine. Like somebody NBC,
*  they will take that show and it's going to go to another network and it will be the same. And if
*  for some reason, Zazz off and the rest of Warner, they block it. They will be considered like the
*  biggest grinses of like that, that might lead to our first civil war in the last 150 years. If,
*  if they inside the NBA crew is just held hostage on a channel that doesn't have basketball anymore,
*  we might, we might actually see actual fighting between States. I'm concerned.
*  Do inside NASCAR or something, you know, maybe that'll be the pivot.
*  They'll go to the other sports that they have, but yeah, I, I find it hard to believe that,
*  you know, if NBC or somebody gets the rights, that they'll break that thing up completely. Like,
*  it's obviously the best studio show to sport has ever known. So, you know, get that thing together.
*  But as long as I think it'll be okay, man, they got these things called golden parachutes, allegedly
*  from what I hear. I think you'll be completely fine for generations of Zazz laws to be spending
*  that Warner money. I promise you. Well, how's the, do you think the NBAs or twice as much as they
*  paid for the last deal to get less games and to get the conference finals every other year instead of
*  the, so basically you're getting a worse deal that you had before for double the price. You
*  would just do it regardless. It's worth what somebody is willing to pay for it. That's the
*  answer. Right. And NBC stepped right the fuck up and said, Hey, guess what? We're willing to pay for
*  the B package. Yeah. We don't care what, you know, it's every other this and we don't get,
*  you know, we want to be in the business of the NBA. We want to be a partner of the NBA. And so,
*  you know, that, that dude, that is how to have his opportunity. They had their exclusive negotiating
*  period and it didn't go anywhere. He clearly misjudged, uh, what exactly was happening in
*  the media space. Not great from the head of a newly formed, you know, Megalopolis media entity
*  with all of these properties, misread. One of the most crucial brand opportunities doesn't seem like
*  good leadership, but take that $50 million homie. I'm sure it will help you see well at night inside
*  your Freddie, uh, soft sheets. Was I I'm excited if NBC universal. And I think they already got it.
*  That's why when we did the puck podcast, I saw mine, I think, uh, I think a seven man pregame
*  shows in play. I think about what they've done with NFL. I think, I don't know who the NBA version
*  of Jack Collins worth is who's related to somebody that might be able to get in there, but I'm excited
*  for the nepotism. Maybe this is a landing spot for Briony James. We'll see. I mean, as long as they
*  inventize the get eventized the games, man, make it feel like a big deal, do a good job for
*  producing the product. I don't know that the NBA's partners since NBC lost the deal,
*  they've always done a great job of making these games feel big and important and that kind of
*  thing. And so as long as they do a better job at that than has been previously shown, you know,
*  I'm all for it, man. I like, I don't know how they're going to like, yeah, the NFL situation
*  where it's Tony Gonzalez and like 20 different of the cats. Like I'm not sure about, I don't watch
*  those shows me personally. Like that's when I go get a snack. I mute the television, maybe,
*  you know, cut something else on. But I, you know, I want to believe that these guys can do a good
*  job with the product, man. But you watch Ringer Wise Guys on Fandle TV, right?
*  Of course. Every single time, every ep. I'm locked in. Raheem. All right.
