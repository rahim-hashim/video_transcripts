# Doc Rivers Regrets Trading SGA to the Thunder | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg)
*  Do you believe in OKC yet? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=0.0s)]
*  I just think they're really good. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=2.72s)]
*  I don't believe they're a championship team. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=4.32s)]
*  But they're just really good. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  They're going to have a great season. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=9.92s)]
*  And, and, and Shea, can we put them in the top five yet? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=12.08s)]
*  I mean, he's right there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=16.64s)]
*  So I was going to ask you Shea versus Hal Burton. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=18.32s)]
*  That's kind of like, there's an NBA guard spot. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=21.76s)]
*  Luca's got one. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=25.44s)]
*  Curry's got one. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=26.8s)]
*  But then Shea and Hal Burton, it's like, well, wait a second. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=27.84s)]
*  I only have two spots. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=29.92s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Oh, Shea. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  Over Hal Burton? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=33.6s)]
*  For me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=34.72s)]
*  And I love Hal Burton, but Shea is every night. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=35.68s)]
*  Teams have not figured out how to slow him down. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  He didn't have a lot of bad nights. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  He is, he's a spectacular player. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=46.32s)]
*  What I do like for the league, they're both spectacular people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  And I think that's great for our league. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=52.8s)]
*  Hal Burton, the stuff he's done with Indiana, like to, to, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=55.2s)]
*  from a leadership standpoint, seems like a 10 out of 10. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=58.64s)]
*  And Shea is more, a little quiet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=61.92s)]
*  But what's, what's crazy about that team is like, if, oh, it's a tie game with five minutes left. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=64.64s)]
*  It kind of doesn't matter who's on the other side. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=70.64s)]
*  It's like, oh, I have to go against Curry tonight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=73.2s)]
*  Oh, oh, that's Luca. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=75.92s)]
*  Like he doesn't care to book her together. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=77.36s)]
*  I'm going to get my points. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=79.92s)]
*  Shea's kind of quiet, sneaky. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=81.6s)]
*  He's not that quiet, but he's kind of quiet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=84.08s)]
*  But he's got this competitive gene bill in him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=86.56s)]
*  It's an inner thing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=91.44s)]
*  When you coach him, you see it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=92.48s)]
*  He's a killer. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  He is an absolute killer. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=96.16s)]
*  And I think that's a form of leadership for their team. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=99.44s)]
*  Well, I got to ask because your team traded them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=103.36s)]
*  So I was going to those games his rookie year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=108.72s)]
*  I never saw this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=111.76s)]
*  I will never say I even saw one piece of, oh, this guy will average 30 points a game, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=113.12s)]
*  but we all love them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=119.84s)]
*  And we were like, man, this guy's a real dude. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=121.44s)]
*  This is a two way guard. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=124.0s)]
*  This guy is something. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=125.68s)]
*  And when they made the trade and it was all those picks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=126.48s)]
*  And I remember doing the pod that I was like, man, people don't, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=130.56s)]
*  the Shea thing is like, that's like a real piece. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=133.92s)]
*  Like that guy's really good. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=136.24s)]
*  So what was your reaction? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=138.16s)]
*  Well, my reaction was we're getting Kawhi and Paul George was happy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=140.24s)]
*  Having said that, I did bring it up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  And I did say, man, can we give them somebody else? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=148.0s)]
*  Like we cannot give up Shea. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=152.24s)]
*  I even told Kawhi when he was saying like, I need another guy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=154.0s)]
*  And Kawhi will verify. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=159.44s)]
*  I kept saying, you know, Kawhi, Shea is going to be a star. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=160.56s)]
*  But how long? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=165.44s)]
*  I don't know how long, but he's going to be one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, and, you know, so I think we saw it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=169.44s)]
*  We didn't know it was going to be this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=172.72s)]
*  You know, it's going to be that nobody. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no one knows that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  But we saw greatness that this dude is going to be. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=176.88s)]
*  He's going to be a hell of a player. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=181.04s)]
*  He's a hell of a worker. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=182.48s)]
*  He's coachable. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=184.72s)]
*  He's everything that you want in a star player. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=185.68s)]
*  And we did see that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=189.04s)]
*  So looking back at that Kawhi decision where he's like, I'll come, but I, you, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=191.68s)]
*  you also have to get Paul George and you look back and it was like, that was kind of stupid. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=197.84s)]
*  I think Paul George is excellent. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=203.2s)]
*  No, but yeah, well, now you look back because you don't know what, what shape, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=205.28s)]
*  but even Kawhi just won the title. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=208.16s)]
*  It's not like I got to get a Rin this year. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=210.4s)]
*  He just won. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=212.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=212.8s)]
*  And you could say like, just go to the Quippers. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=213.84s)]
*  They have a good team already. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  They have good coach. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=217.2s)]
*  They're going to have all these picks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=218.8s)]
*  Like, let's just see it for like a couple of months. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=220.8s)]
*  And then you can decide like that in retrospect, that would have been the decision, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=224.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=228.16s)]
*  Forget about the shape part. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=228.32s)]
*  In retrospect, if you could have convinced Kawhi come, all right, let's see what we have. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=229.44s)]
*  If we want to go get Paul, we can still go get him. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=236.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=239.28s)]
*  That trade, that trade with 19 picks was going to be there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=239.52s)]
*  No one else, no one else is doing that trade. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=242.32s)]
*  So in retrospect, which we don't get to do. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=244.88s)]
*  But the problem was it didn't, we didn't know. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=248.64s)]
*  And I will listen, I'm not a cart player or a gambler. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=251.92s)]
*  I am on the golf course. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=255.76s)]
*  But it would have been interesting if we had played the game with Kawhi. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  Kawhi was basically saying, if you don't get A, he's going to go to B, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=262.64s)]
*  So and bombers worried he's going to go to the Lakers and the Quippers lose out again. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=268.0s)]
*  They lost that on Kobe in 2004. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but we couldn't lose to the Lakers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=274.8s)]
*  We're like, you know what I mean? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=276.48s)]
*  But like we could not let them get them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=277.84s)]
*  I don't believe in my heart that Kawhi would have gotten there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=280.56s)]
*  So I don't either. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  Especially knowing what we know now is never going to happen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=286.96s)]
*  I think he was coming to us all along, but he had all the cards. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=289.76s)]
*  You know, it's funny, Bill, he came to my house. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=294.16s)]
*  Like I had that house in Malibu at the time, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=298.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=301.68s)]
*  I was the only house that he came to. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=302.88s)]
*  He didn't go to anybody's house in Toronto. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=304.88s)]
*  He met the Lakers in a hotel room. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=308.08s)]
*  We didn't even go to their facility yet. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=311.28s)]
*  He came to my house, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  And I kept saying, he's telling us what he's doing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=316.32s)]
*  He's telling us we have them, but he had all the leverage and we had to bite for sure. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=321.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=327.84s)]
*  In retrospect, you could have done the, we tried Paul George. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=328.08s)]
*  They just wanted too much, but we promise we're going to double down. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=331.84s)]
*  Because at that point you had Shea, who was going to be in year two. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=335.44s)]
*  You had, you still had Galanari, who was still a really good rotation player at that time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=339.12s)]
*  Very solid. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=343.6s)]
*  But in general, I think you would just want, you knew Williams, you just won 48 games. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=344.96s)]
*  You were just going to add Kawhi. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=348.88s)]
*  I always thought like, I just don't see him going with LeBron and I just don't see it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=350.32s)]
*  I don't think he ever, no way. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=356.88s)]
*  He's too competitive. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=357.84s)]
*  You know, say what you want about Kawhi, missing game, but Kawhi's a competitive dude, Bill. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=359.04s)]
*  Like, there's no way he wants to be better than LeBron. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=364.64s)]
*  Like that's how competitive he is. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=370.16s)]
*  I just could not see him joining the Lakers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChKhVWcoCg&t=372.40000000000003s)]
