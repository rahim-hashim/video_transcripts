# What Does the Future Hold for James Harden? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [August 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxHcouxPxns)
*  We got to talk about James Harden.
*  Jacoby, I asked you an assignment.
*  What did James Harden's next three years look like?
*  So we're going from August 23 all the way through July 2026.
*  Walk us through what teams does he play for?
*  Where does he live?
*  How much money does he make?
*  It's just everything James Harden.
*  What do you have?
*  Jacoby, can I throw in something real quick?
*  Absolutely.
*  He's going to be 34 in two weeks.
*  Copy that.
*  So birthday is coming up.
*  So I just want you to remember that.
*  Happy birthday, Jimmy.
*  Happy birthday, Jimmy Harden.
*  And it's like an older 34, like when 50 Cent turned 34.
*  It's like he's 34, but it feels feels like 39.
*  Well, let me let me start by this.
*  As you also asked, like if you had to give James Harden advice, what would it be?
*  Because I think that is very important to what the next three years look like.
*  Because if if if James Harden called my phone, I was like,
*  guys, hold on a second.
*  Pause the pod, Kyle.
*  I have to talk to James Harden because he wants my advice.
*  I would strongly, strongly suggest that he play basketball well
*  for thirty five million dollars for the Philadelphia 76ers.
*  I think that is clearly the only path for him to get what he wants,
*  for him to get paid handsomely to play basketball after this year.
*  If there is any sort of repeating of what he's done in Houston
*  and what he's done in Brooklyn here in Philadelphia,
*  he's costing himself maybe one hundred million dollars.
*  But here's how I predict it will play out.
*  I predict he will show up and play for the Sixers
*  and he will not give 100 percent or he will not give the same effort
*  he gave last year.
*  He will not perform the same numerically.
*  And I believe that he will be traded at the deadline.
*  Before the deadline for 60 or 70 cents on the dollar for some pieces.
*  I don't think that.
*  Darrell can really do anything right now that makes them a better team
*  without James Harden, like there's no trade out there that makes them better.
*  If you trade James Harden, you know, make the better move
*  is to hope he comes back and is somehow happy.
*  But if you want me to predict how it plays, he comes back and he is unhappy,
*  so unhappy at which it becomes a situation where you can add
*  by subtracting him from the locker room and you get 60 cents on the dollar.
*  And then he plays the end of the year for that team, becomes a free agent
*  and then has his agent sweep the landscape for interested teams
*  and finds out that what's out there for him is 30,
*  40 million dollars in two years, maybe with.
*  Oh, yeah, I don't even think that much.
*  Look at what happened to Russell Westbrook.
*  Russell Westbrook went down to three point eight million this year.
*  He went from 47 to three point eight.
*  I don't I don't think I let's not forget the year
*  that James Harden had last year on the basketball court.
*  Let's not forget the three teams he quit on. He was good.
*  He led the league in assist and he adapted his game to playing alongside
*  M.B.P. Joel Embiid.
*  They went on streaks during the regular season that he had a lot to do with.
*  And they looked like a good basketball team.
*  And, you know, and even the Celtics series like we all remember
*  that game, game one. Like, sure.
*  Remember, game six, game seven.
*  I think the off court stuff with James Harden has sort of has has muddied
*  our vision, blurred our vision about what the on court stuff is.
*  With reason.
*  I still think he has value, but I think it plays out like this.
*  He gets traded before the deadline.
*  He plays for a team, whether it's the Clippers or not, for the rest of the season.
*  He does not resign with them.
*  He becomes a free agent and gets like 30 million dollars for two years.
*  That if you want.
*  And I don't know what team that is, but it's going to be not that.
*  The team doesn't exist.
*  It's a team in fantasy land.
*  Wads, what do you think? That's how I see it.
*  Do you want to hear a ridiculous idea or a serious analysis?
*  Let's go serious first and then we'll go ridiculous.
*  I think that he would be doing a disservice
*  to Embiid, who he seems to have a real relationship with
*  if he shows up and doesn't give 100 percent.
*  So I think if he does show up, he's going to play.
*  But the Darrell Maury is a liar stuff is not great.
*  And if there's any sort of like this kind of rumors
*  that there was a handshake deal, a wink wink deal that like, hey, take this pay cut
*  and I'll get you later.
*  Turns out I'm not going to get you later.
*  He has a right to be upset.
*  And I saw Wozze reporting.
*  They're kind of looking into salary caps, circum circumvention.
*  If that actually happened, they already did what looked into it.
*  I already debunked this on Twitter.
*  I was going to Houston.
*  I did it like four days ago.
*  He's got he thought he was going to Houston.
*  Yeah. And he got there first.
*  Although reporting there was ESPN Wozze on Christmas Day reported it in March.
*  There was this big athletic story about how what the bond between Houston and Hardin
*  and then in May, same thing.
*  Houston, Houston.
*  It's that's where Philly thought he was going.
*  And they didn't feel like he had any loyalty to them.
*  My question is, if he felt like he was promised this week,
*  wink contract from Philly, then why was all the Houston ship being reported for six months?
*  What really happened is a doka came in.
*  He got the job at the end of April.
*  And they were like, what about James?
*  I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we could talk about it.
*  And then as soon as he got the job, he was like, I don't want to fucking want that guy.
*  And he threw his body in front of it.
*  And they went from Hardin to Fred Van Vleet.
*  That's what happened. Hardin thought he was going there.
*  He thought he was getting a big contract.
*  That's why he took a little less money to help them.
*  Philly went for one year because he knew he was probably going to leave.
*  That's my theory. And I think I'm right.
*  Well, you know, once that Houston thing got pulled out and Darrell says to him,
*  all right, we're going to trade.
*  Yeah, we'll trade you this summer.
*  And then he looks around and nobody fucking wants James Harden like, sorry.
*  Clippers didn't even wouldn't even offer Terrence Mann for him.
*  And then go through the league.
*  Who has space for a guy making thirty five million?
*  Like if you're Miami, would you trade Tyler here for him?
*  No way. You're not doing that.
*  Just go through the league, try to find me the James Harden trade.
*  All of a sudden, you're looking at Charlotte with Gordon Heyward
*  and a protected number one. Why would Charlotte do that?
*  Why would Washington trade Jordan Poole for him?
*  Like go through every team.
*  There's no James Harden trade.
*  Philly knows it. They told him that.
*  And whether he fully realized that or I don't know.
*  I mean, he's always had a weird kind of circle situation like
*  Polinka left a while ago and he said he's had no agent.
*  He's gotten help from different agents.
*  He always seems like he has a shifting team.
*  It just seems like he's getting bad advice.
*  I agree with that. I agree with that.
*  Do you do you think going back to what I was saying about player narratives,
*  if I was to come in and I was like, hey, James, here's the thing.
*  The narrative around you is that you're the highest usage rate guy in the league
*  who scored 36 points a game, 34 points, led the league in scoring all that.
*  Draw the fouls. Do the whole thing.
*  You're not that guy anymore.
*  You're actually a super unselfish guy
*  who has brought his scoring down to 21 points a game,
*  who took a 14 million dollar pay cut, who led the league in assists
*  and bought your buddy a Rolex when he won MVP.
*  So all you have to do is somehow spin the quitting on the third team to.
*  Cement this new narrative that you're actually an unselfish player.
*  That is the that is the narrative is that you're the most selfish player.
*  The quitting on the team certainly doesn't help, but he needs to spin.
*  Someone needs to go out there and spin that for him.
*  I think playing on selfish and he took he took 14 million.
*  And let me just say, oh, the 14 million dollar pay cut.
*  Oh, sure. That's no big deal.
*  Aaron Rodgers did it. And there was a seven day parade.
*  James Harden, they're like, oh, that was good.
*  Well, that's nice.
*  He took the big cut and then they just they hired his friends.
*  Tucker, Tres and Daniel House.
*  And then they got docked for tampering for for a couple of picks.
*  And they went through all their emails and everything.
*  So that's why there's another investigation.
*  Also, like, see, nobody remembers this, but Minnesota lost five
*  first round picks when they did a wink wink thing with Joe Smith.
*  Like the league's really harsh on on that thing.
*  You'd have to be crazy to do that in 2023, especially with all the different ways
*  they can keep receipts on things.
*  And I just think it's too risky for Philly.
*  Jacobs, if Hardin Hardin comes to me right now
*  and he says, I like your podcast, I don't really like anybody around me in my life.
*  Which I do.
*  I would do exactly what you laid out.
*  Go back to Philly. You know what?
*  Play great. Just just apologize.
*  Just look at the big picture.
*  You're you're in a contract there anyway that you opted in on.
*  That's the other thing. He fucking opted into the contract.
*  So because he couldn't get another one. Right.
*  So you opted in. That was your decision.
*  Look at the landscape.
*  Boston, if this poor Zingis guy only knows what's going on,
*  but there's a chance Boston's going to be worse.
*  There's a chance Miami who lost Gabe Vincent, they lost Strews,
*  and they might not get Dave Millard and they're older.
*  They might be worse.
*  Milwaukee is a rookie coach.
*  You just going down the line.
*  It's like you guys might actually be the one seed.
*  If you just come back with Nick Nurse and you're happy.
*  Like, I actually think they could be the one seed,
*  but he could also torpedo it and it could be a disaster.
*  But what is the better situation for him?
*  You're going to go to Clippers and play with load management.
*  Kawhi, you're going to play with, you know, this goofy Clipper team
*  that's never done jack shit.
*  That's that's a better situation than playing in Philly with Embiid and Nick.
*  I don't get it.
*  I think it's really weird.
*  It's weird that he doesn't see that it's the best situation,
*  which makes me not trust him as like a basketball entity.
*  Where does he want to win a title?
*  I don't even know, because if he wants to win a title, stay in Philly.
*  Well, it's not even when you're in Darrell's dirty work, but I'm not.
*  I just know I just think it's common sense.
*  It's not wanting to win a title.
*  Let's say that he just wants to maximize his earnings over the next three years.
*  The there's the number one choice to do so is to play good basketball
*  for the Philadelphia 76ers this season.
*  And there's a huge gap before you get to number two, a huge gap.
*  So it's like even if even if it's not about winning a title, which is like as fans,
*  it's what we want players to care about the most.
*  Let's say that he's like, I'm trying to get as much money
*  because I see the twilight of my career.
*  There is only real one real option there.
*  And that is to play good, hard basketball for Philadelphia.
*  And if you're Philadelphia, there's a whole Embiid thing
*  because this is getting messy.
*  And, you know, you have to say there's a whole Embiid angle.
*  Like there's a lot of damage control that you have to do with Joel Embiid
*  when James Harden's talking to 15 year old Chinese kids about Darrell Maury.
*  What was the question that was asked that led to that statement?
*  Was someone in the crowd?
*  How do you feel about Darrell Maury?
*  Yeah, it was also kind of fucked up because that, you know,
*  Darrell's not exactly Beyonce in China.
*  No. And it just felt a little intentional.
*  Before, I don't want to sound like I'm defending Darrell
*  because I think his infatuation with Harden is going to end up,
*  you know, really damaging, like the big picture of his career.
*  Like the fact that over and over again, he just kept getting sucked in by this guy.
*  And, you know, like the Ben Simmons piece where say Indiana offered Sabonis.
*  Sabonis got turned into Halliburton and healed, which makes me think
*  I think it's pretty fair to say that they could have turned
*  Ben Simmons into Halliburton and healed, which is a way better basketball trade.
*  But they just really wanted Harden.
*  He vouched for the guy and now blow up in his face.
*  And, you know, he he wanted to bring in a guy that had quit on two teams,
*  which is on him.
*  At what point, at what point, Bill, do you think Embiid,
*  who seems to love Philly with all his heart, says, you know what?
*  I had Ben Simmons, you told me it was going to work.
*  And then he left.
*  I had was playing with Jimmy Butler.
*  Jimmy Butler, he left and I had James Harden.
*  And you guys screwed that up.
*  And granted, it was different regimes screwing it up.
*  Yeah, like I'm kind of done with this.
*  I don't know if he's ever going to get to that point because it feels like he's really
*  in the fabric of Philadelphia at this point.
*  I think it'd be shocking if he left.
*  But I think if it was happening to somebody else, somewhere else,
*  he would be the first one to ask out.
*  You know what I would start to ask out this year?
*  You know what I would say to him if he asked if he said all that stuff to me?
*  Play good in the playoffs.
*  And my knee hurt.
*  You know, I got hit in the face.
*  Just kick ass for four straight weeks in April and May.
*  As a broken face, I was just a broken face.
*  I'm not saying you can't do it, just do it once.
*  My face was the awesome in the Boston series.
*  What's the excuse for that?
*  My knee hurt.
*  Seem pretty healthy. Bad matchup.
*  Bad matchup.
*  It's the MVP.
*  Bad matchup.
*  I think they killed us.
*  They just went on fire.
*  Who could go?
*  Yeah. What do you want me to do?
*  I wouldn't bet on this, but I think there's a 10 to 1 chance.
*  Nah, 20 to 1.
*  But I could see Harden in China next year, not getting anything.
*  No, I'm serious.
*  Not getting anything close to where he thought he was going to get money wise
*  from the NBA and just saying, I'll go to China.
*  I'll take a huge check from them.
*  And then maybe February, March, I'll come back
*  and I could play NBA and get in basically double dip because I,
*  Jacoby thought he was like two for 40.
*  I don't see it.
*  The only reason Kyrie got that money is because Dallas was already kind of pot
*  committed to that terrible trade they made and they had no choice.
*  What are you going to do? You have to keep Luca.
*  The Kyrie was some form of asset and you just got to keep your fingers crossed
*  and hope it works out.
*  But, you know, if they had to clarify who's doing it to clarify, he is.
*  If he plays well this year, he's two for 30 or 40
*  it when he's a free agent.
*  That's I'm saying that's in the hypothetical in which it
*  though, I'm saying in the hypothetical scenario in which he plays well
*  for Philly this year and then leaves Philadelphia.
*  That's the type of deal I would expect.
*  That really makes me nervous.
