# How Scary Are the Mavs Out West? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU)
*  I remade one of the great buzzer beater shots I've ever seen in my life. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=0.0s)]
*  Brasileau, uh, a 20 foot running lefty. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=3.18s)]
*  It's a borderline sky hook. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=8.94s)]
*  What was it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=10.84s)]
*  Almost looked like the magic junior sky hook, but lefty over Yocage to win the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=11.3s)]
*  game and Maxie Klieba put his, put his arms behind his hands behind his head. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=16.1s)]
*  Like Thomas Hill after the later shot. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=22.48s)]
*  And Luca just sunk to the ground in disbelief because real basketball [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=25.2s)]
*  players are like, that shot's fucking impossible. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=28.88s)]
*  Nobody should ever make that shot ever. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=30.7s)]
*  That shot is so hard. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=33.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=35.0s)]
*  To be going that direction where it's not even really just a straightforward [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  floater, the angle that he's at. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=41.48s)]
*  And then he throws it in lefty. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=43.8s)]
*  It's just, you know, it's, it's part of the, the brilliance of Kyrie and, and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=46.0s)]
*  just why when people talk about like the most skilled and that kind of stuff, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  like we know he's the best ball handler we've ever seen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=55.16s)]
*  Um, you know, there's this love for him from other just hoopers who are like, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=58.52s)]
*  dude, like some of the stuff that this guy does. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=64.24s)]
*  And I think that's always been kind of the frustration is that, you know, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=67.24s)]
*  we, I don't want to spend a lot of time on all the rest of it, but it's like, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=70.08s)]
*  Oh, how come you guys are just in Kyrie? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=73.54s)]
*  And it's like, well, it's, it's not that it's just, you want to see somebody [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=74.84s)]
*  have a long stretch of consistency of playing because you know what he's capable of. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=79.0s)]
*  Enough time has passed. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=84.64s)]
*  When he had that weird Celtic season that I've gone back to the basketball [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=85.76s)]
*  mode of, I just appreciate watching how good he is again. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=89.02s)]
*  And that's all I see. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=91.76s)]
*  And he's 25, five and five again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=92.92s)]
*  He's missed his usual 15 to 16 games. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=95.44s)]
*  What was the stat they said? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=98.38s)]
*  How many games, how many consecutive games that he played? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=99.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  So this is his 18th straight game that he's played, which is the longest [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=102.24s)]
*  consecutive streak of games played without missing any since 2016 from Kyrie. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=106.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=111.8s)]
*  In the last eight years, this is his longest streak. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=112.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, when, when you hear some people be frustrated, you're like, okay, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  that's nuts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=119.72s)]
*  It's eight years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=120.72s)]
*  What do you think of Dallas? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=123.32s)]
*  I I'm going to be scared of Luca in a playoffs series because we've already seen [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=126.16s)]
*  it, whether it's the Western conference finals run and taken out my guys in [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=130.7s)]
*  Phoenix, which is one of the most depressed podcasts I've probably ever done with you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=135.0s)]
*  Um, yeah, those, those Clippers series were just incredible individual [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=139.28s)]
*  performances, like he and Kawhi going back and forth. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=144.54s)]
*  Like that was all time kind of plug. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff where I, I still say, I don't know if you share this with [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  me, but you know, it's largely an irrelevant series. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=152.1s)]
*  It's not like legacy defining, but it was this, this wake up call of, again, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=155.78s)]
*  not even Luca, a lot of the Kawhi stuff. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=160.82s)]
*  You're like, this is like absurdly high level stuff that we're [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  seeing from these two dudes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=165.54s)]
*  So let me just throw it back to you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=166.5s)]
*  If it's a seven, two and Oklahoma city is a half game up now with Denver's lost. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=168.18s)]
*  Oklahoma city has the season series against the nuggets three one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=172.94s)]
*  So that's why they were ahead in the tie break, even though they were both 40 and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=175.52s)]
*  seven, excuse me, 47 and 20 to start the day. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=177.96s)]
*  If Minnesota or okay, sees in a seven, two game series with the Dallas, I think the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=180.98s)]
*  best compliment I could give mass fans is like, you know, I wish you had a better [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=188.84s)]
*  record against the better teams in general, because we go to those expanded. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=192.5s)]
*  Standings like they're still, you know, they're still worse off than a lot of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=196.28s)]
*  the teams that are in front of them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=200.68s)]
*  But for Luke and that, like, I wouldn't rule it out is I guess my point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=201.52s)]
*  The two guys, that's the strength. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=206.84s)]
*  The PJ Washington trade. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  I just don't think has worked that well for him, although he did some good non [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=211.84s)]
*  scoring stuff in today's game, but he's just, he has not shot the ball well at [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=215.36s)]
*  all for them and grant, meanwhile, grants, but playing pretty well in Charlotte, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=219.5s)]
*  which has been funny to watch. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  High leverage hornets, right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=225.0s)]
*  I don't really trust their swings, but I'm scared of the two guys. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=228.34s)]
*  And if you, if you separate the West and the haves and you just go six, seven, eight, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=232.56s)]
*  nine, 10, which right now is Sacramento six, Dallas, Phoenix, Golden state, Lakers [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=236.78s)]
*  watching what's happened to Phoenix in a couple of the games this past week, I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=241.6s)]
*  think has been pretty alarming with the Celtics did to them on Thursday night. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=245.66s)]
*  If I'm a Phoenix fan, I'm alarmed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  Cause I had my whole team today was worse today. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  Just the Milwaukee puts up one 40 on them without Yanis. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  That was, that was really weird. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=256.34s)]
*  And Duran had a very strange game. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  Uh, but if it's Sacramento, Dallas, Phoenix, Golden state, the Lakers, and I'm [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=260.17999999999995s)]
*  one of the top three seeds and it's like, who don't I want to see out of those [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=264.5s)]
*  bottom five, it's clearly Dallas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=268.52s)]
*  It's clearly Dallas. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=270.9s)]
*  It's not Sacramento. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=272.62s)]
*  It's not Phoenix and it's not Golden state or the Lakers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=273.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=277.9s)]
*  Depending on the size matchup, that's where I think Sacramento would run into [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=278.05999999999995s)]
*  problems. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=280.73999999999995s)]
*  I think Golden state would run into those problems. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  I mean, Golden state was great yesterday, but Anthony Davis played 12 minutes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that was a completely different game. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=286.5s)]
*  Jackson Hayes was in crunch time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=288.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=289.78s)]
*  I mean, Jackson Hayes just isn't the reason there was a reason he was [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=290.06s)]
*  available for a million bucks. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=292.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=293.82s)]
*  You know, I know he's going to have a couple of dunks that are really nice, but [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=294.02s)]
*  like, if you really locked into defensively what they were doing, we already know [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=296.17999999999995s)]
*  the Lakers without Vando are just going to be challenged defensively to begin [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=299.26s)]
*  with and 80s cleaning up all that stuff. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=302.62s)]
*  I think the number was four points in the paint and the 12 minutes 80 was in. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=304.78s)]
*  He leaves with the eye thing, doesn't come back. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=308.38s)]
*  And then it was like 54 points in the paint. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=310.5s)]
*  I mean, that was just a layup line for Golden state. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=313.29999999999995s)]
*  So even the Golden states put some things together. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=315.3s)]
*  I've actually really liked how Clay's looked this month. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=317.82s)]
*  It seems like they've really figured out the rotation. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=320.26s)]
*  He's okay off the bench. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=322.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=323.3s)]
*  I thought Draymond was excellent in that game yesterday. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=323.62s)]
*  I like how the Warriors look. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=327.3s)]
*  Kamiga getting off to that start because the Lakers sag off of him so much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=328.54s)]
*  But I think you're, I think you're right about the Dallas part of it because [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=332.94s)]
*  Dallas with Luca has a better player than at this point. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=336.1s)]
*  I mean, Luca is better than any single player, despite how we feel about [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=342.98s)]
*  Katie Booker and Steph and, you know, the collective of Sacramento, but [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  they've got the best guy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=352.1s)]
*  And you could feel it in that Denver game at some point when they're trading [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=352.98s)]
*  baskets and when it was close, it's, you know, pretty nice to have Luca on your [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=355.82s)]
*  side and pretty nice to have Kyrie as the second option bailout thing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I don't, I don't think Dallas is going to win three straight rounds, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=363.66s)]
*  but I would not be afraid of Sacramento at all. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo05PU-YJVU&t=367.70000000000005s)]
