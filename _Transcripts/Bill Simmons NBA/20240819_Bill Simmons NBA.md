# Jeff Bezos to Buy the Celtics?  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E3AYG-CyQA)
*  The Celtics are for sale and I happen to have a bunch of information on this
*  because this is a huge, huge topic right now in, in the circles of people that
*  would want to buy a team and there's a bunch of stuff going on.
*  I don't care about being aggregated on this because I'm right.
*  The league wants 6 billion for the team, for the Celtics, 6 billion.
*  They don't own their arena.
*  It's a crazy price, but they're probably going to get it.
*  So there's that.
*  They want the 6 billion because they want expansion teams in Seattle and Vegas.
*  And then Mexico city is kind of looming as a third team, but they want to get
*  6 billion a piece for the two franchises for expansion, which would mean a check
*  of $400 million to every NBA owner, all 30, right?
*  So they're trying to establish a price with the Celtics team and the Celtics
*  themselves, the gross spec family, because the dad of the majority owner,
*  Wick is driving the sale and he's, there's no fair.
*  He's like 90, right?
*  He's 90.
*  He's a legend.
*  He's going to 25 times what he paid for the team.
*  And he just wants the highest price.
*  He's not like, Oh, these local guys, let's cut him.
*  He doesn't care.
*  He wants the biggest price he could possibly get.
*  And in the last few days, there's been some, I think, legitimate buzz about
*  Jeff Bezos buying the Celtics.
*  And I think it's real.
*  I think he's going to be one of the suitors, which got me thinking, why would
*  Jeff Bezos, when he's looking at the Celtics, what is he seeing?
*  What does he want?
*  And I think the only way it makes sense, I mean, he, granted he has a
*  kajillion dollars, but it's one of the crown jewel franchises, right?
*  That's why you get it.
*  Like to him, it would be no different than if he bought this famous
*  gigantic $300 million yacht.
*  But I think it's real that he's potentially in the mix for this.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's say you're Bezos.
*  Cause I'm really trying to figure out like, if this is like really for real,
*  he's going to be the owner of the Celtics.
*  Like, what is that going to look like?
*  But how will it look differently?
*  Explain to me how it will look differently.
*  What will happen?
*  Oh no, I'm trying.
*  I'm just praying for him.
*  Okay.
*  What's the win for him to own?
*  Cause he kicked the tires with the, uh, the Washington football team too, which
*  is not, I don't think that's high in the crown jewel rankings.
*  If you own the Celtics, you know, Boston's pretty rabid sports city.
*  You're gonna have to spend money to take it seriously.
*  So why would you do it?
*  And then I was thinking, well, they, their arena, their leases,
*  like eight, nine more years.
*  Is the play for him some sort of Amazon stadium?
*  Like we're already kind of seeing this with Balmer and some of these other,
*  like these touch, these touchless stadiums, where you just go in and
*  grab things and walk out is the ultimate play for this to build some sort of.
*  State of the art stadium.
*  That's never been done before for concerts and for basketball.
*  And it's like the Amazon dome and you put it like a downtown Boston, and then
*  that just becomes another thing he did.
*  And it's an interesting question.
*  I mean, like, I know you'll, you love the Rolling Stones, right?
*  We talked about the rolling stones.
*  Um, and a lot of times when the Rolling Stones come up in conversation, there
*  is a fairly obvious question asked.
*  It's like, why are they still doing this?
*  Like, what is the purpose of them to still tour?
*  Why are their tickets still that expensive?
*  Why are they trying to, you know, and the idea initially, a lot of people
*  asking that question, they're just, they see it totally as a question of greed.
*  Like, why is making, why are making kids so greedy that they're still trying to
*  like make all this money at the end of their life?
*  I mean, Mick Jagger said he doesn't want to give his money to his kids.
*  Yeah.
*  So what's he doing?
*  Well, I suppose it might have something to do with almost like a video game
*  mentality, like it's just the number itself.
*  It's just like, it's amazing that we can, I can earn this money.
*  I can't spend it.
*  I'll have the new relationship to this money.
*  It will just go in, you know, uh, base of pewter's there, my phone
*  screen saying, this is how much money I have.
*  It won't, there's nothing Mick Jagger can't buy now.
*  There's nothing that's outside of his, you know, even I would think
*  even if he wanted, if he wanted to have political power or whatever, he
*  would have achieved enough to do that.
*  Um, so the same with his, with Bezos buying the Celtics, it's like, he's
*  like, what's, I mean, it's like, what else is he supposed to do with his money?
*  I mean, what, what you have $70 billion or your value that's $75 billion.
*  And you're not even really spending that money.
*  People are giving you that money to pay for something that you're not, you know,
*  it's like, they're just using your wealth as sort of collateral.
*  It's a completely fictional world.
*  Well, I don't know if we can like, like you, you, you're kind of, I guess,
*  expressing that you think that there'd be, he has like a motive for doing this.
*  Like, no, I don't, I don't, I don't really know the, I have a thought on
*  Jagger and then, then I can answer the basis thing.
*  I don't think it's about money for the Rolling Stones anymore.
*  I think, I think, I think people like him and Springsteen, they kind of feel
*  like this is what keeps them alive.
*  And the moment they stopped doing this, they're just going to drop dead.
*  So they keep doing it because the energy they get from the concerts
*  is what keeps them going.
*  I don't, I don't, I don't think it's a financial thing at all.
*  I mean, it feels like you give a speech in front of 150 people and you do a
*  great job and they really laugh.
*  It feels great.
*  I can't imagine what that must feel like for them.
*  Um, there must also be though, sort of a weird kind of cognitive dissidence with
*  him recognizing that what people are cheering and clapping for in a way has
*  nothing to do with what he's doing that night.
*  It sort of has to do with like his career, his life, what they think, what
*  the, it means to be a Rolling Stone fan, what they think it means to be a fan, uh,
*  in a public event, all of that in some ways that could be just as satisfying.
*  Well, think about, like, let's say, let's say John Lennon never gets shot.
*  Dude, would the Beatles have had reunion concerts?
*  I think that there is a sense that they would have reunited at live aid.
*  I think that there's a lot of people who believe that because of the cause of
*  live aid, there would have been a real push from George to want to do it.
*  And a lot of times when George wanted to do something, go to India, they did it.
*  Even though he was not, he was like the third most important guy.
*  And yet they seem to kind of agree with a lot of his ideas.
*  Sometimes some things we should do.
*  So I think that they probably would have reunited at live aid.
*  Um, and then it's a fun thought process or thought experiment.
*  And you know, and the bands who did reunited live aid, like zeppelin and
*  black Sabbath and stuff that did eventually lead them to reuniting.
*  So if he had lived, you know, that it probably does happen.
*  I think, I think that there probably would have been a Beatles reunion because,
*  you know, it's, it's like, you know, Paul sort of disappeared in the eighties,
*  like, you know, wings and he wasn't really torn.
*  Michael Jackson stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a yes.
*  Yeah.
*  I know what it lost off then talks to Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson buys
*  all the songs, probably real frustrating.
*  But so there was this period where I think the Beatles would have been like,
*  well, what, who are we?
*  Are we, are we just guys who used to be in the Beatles?
*  Um, and I think that, that it probably could have, like, I definitely don't
*  think, cause they didn't, the amount of animosity among the Beatles kind of
*  peaked in 1970 and decreased from that point.
*  I mean, it's like, you know, Lenin wrote like, how can you sleep and all
*  those songs, like you were kind of criticizing each other back and forth.
*  But then it would be like, George and Ringo would play on those songs.
*  And it seemed like they, like it was, it's hard to tell how much those guys
*  actually had animosity toward each other.
*  That wasn't just like, I'm kind of sick of being with these people, being
*  associated with them and everything, you know, it's all a business problem.
*  So I think they're probably would have reunited if I had to guess.
*  Well, they definitely still hung out a little bit because there's that famous
*  SNL story about Lenin and McCardin and just watching an SNL episode or no
*  more, just doing a cold walk in on your Bezos question.
*  I think I have the answer.
*  I mean, there's two possibilities, right?
*  One is like, this could be the forefront of some new business venture.
*  He's been thinking about with like the next version of the all time
*  state of the art stadium.
*  Maybe that's a piece of it.
*  Anyway, if you're Jeff Bezos, nobody's rooting for you at this point.
*  There's no like Bezos fans, right?
*  There's nobody who's like fucking love Jeff Bezos.
*  So you're at dinner and somebody's like, you know, I fucking love I've been
*  reading everything about, I just think he's a genius kid.
*  I would love to meet him and hang out with them.
*  Jeff Bezos, you know, he's like those super billionaires have just moved
*  into this different realm.
*  You buy the Celtics.
*  What happens when you buy a famous sports team?
*  You become a celebrity in that town.
*  Um, if the team does well, you're beloved.
*  Like you can even see what happened with WIC, the Celtics owner.
*  Like he became the face of the Celtics.
*  He vowed that they were going to win another title.
*  They won it.
*  You know, he was like, you for it at the end, humanized Mark Cuban.
*  It's human.
*  Like Joe, who knew who Joe Laco was the Warriors owner?
*  Like you go on down the line and then conversely, if somebody's a terrible
*  owner or a vile donor, it actually makes things way worse for them.
*  Like somebody like Daniel Snyder.
*  So with Bezos, like, you know, it's a, it's a little bit of a heat check where
*  it's like, if I own the Celtics and I spend money and we do a great job and we
*  pop in and all of a sudden there's some sort of subtle shift, you become more
*  human.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe that's the other piece.
*  And it's just this, you know, you spend a huge chunk of your life acquiring this
*  wealth and I would guess you'd be like, well, I want to do something that is
*  interesting to somebody who doesn't write for fortune magazine or whatever.
*  Like, you know, certainly I think if I was as wealthy as him, I probably would
*  attempt to buy a sports franchise.
*  I just simply because I don't know what else I would do.
*  Right.
*  Like, I'm not sure what else I would spend this money on.
*  You can, I mean, part of what makes a rich guy or rich guy is that their main
*  enjoyment is not spending money, but watching it occur.
*  And maybe I would be that way.
*  I would just want to see it accrue.
*  I think like when I talk about the stones, I think that's part of it.
*  I think that they're not interested in spending their money, but sort of like
*  amazed.
*  It was like, look at this money.
*  Yeah.
*  Made from playing.
*  Yeah.
*  We played these simple songs that are great.
*  People love them so much.
*  We didn't stop.
*  And now we have like, isn't it?
*  Look at that number, you know?
*  Um, but, uh, I, I had, I had this thing about basis.
*  I had not heard that at all.
*  Like this is news to me that, you know, but it doesn't shock me.
*  Like, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that, I mean, I guess I'm kind of reporting it, but he likes
*  sports, that he likes sports.
*  Do we know anything about that?
*  I don't, I don't know that much.
*  I'm actually going to probably read some Bezos stuff because it does seem
*  like it's a possibility.
*  It's interesting.
*  Cause I thought the minority owner was going to get it.
*  Steve Pegg, Luca, you put this group together.
*  He already owns a big chunk of the team, but if somebody comes in and makes
*  some crazy offer, like who the hell knows?
*  And that's, that's what happens over and over again with these sports
*  franchises, what happened with the Clippers?
*  Everyone thought Russ Caruso was going to get, or Rick Caruso was going to get it.
*  The guy, uh, could build all the malls around here, the outdoor malls, and then
*  bombers is like, Oh, I want it.
*  And all of a sudden he's paying $2 billion for it.
*  So, um, but it's, it's all connected with what they want from the expansion teams
*  and all of these, this $6 billion price.
*  They want to get to that price and above.
*  That's what Irv Grossbach, the guy, the 90 year old guy who owns the biggest
*  shit stake of the Celtics who started this process, he wants the biggest price.
*  So we'll see, we'll see what a big crown jewel of the Celtics are.
*  We're about to find out.
