# Encouraging Zion Showcase and Wembanyamaâ€™s First Game | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc5WYPEuSjs)
*  Zion?
*  Mm.
*  Still looks a little heavy to me, but athletically looked really good last night.
*  And I thought it was encouraging, right?
*  Were you encouraged?
*  Definitely.
*  I mean, it's encouraging that he's challenging Jaren Jackson Jr. in the air, right?
*  It's not just bully on the ground, nudge him out of your way and try to finish with layups,
*  but that he's going up in those situations.
*  Those are really encouraging signs.
*  As usual, my concerns with Zion are much more like, is he ever going to guard anybody?
*  Does he have a defensive position?
*  What are they going to do with all that?
*  I'm more concerned about that stuff.
*  Offensively, he's just so efficient.
*  He's so good at getting to his spots inside.
*  So good at finishing around people.
*  Shouldn't be able to finish around.
*  I feel pretty confident about him being a hugely impactful offensive player.
*  I really wonder about the other side.
*  You and Waz and Barrier, you guys did great previews for us that I think are still going.
*  They somehow were longer than our previews.
*  It's perpetual.
*  You had a whole Zion conversation and just about like, what position is he ultimately
*  if your team is a 55-win team?
*  Could he be like a stretch five?
*  Seriously, yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  Where do you put him?
*  Who's the right person to put next to him?
*  He really is this enigma trapped in a riddle.
*  Like a college basketball team just adding the best football player and be like, hey,
*  this guy, he's good.
*  We'll just figure it out.
*  But this is like year, what is it, four or five for him?
*  Year five?
*  God, is it really?
*  No, maybe it's year four or year five.
*  One of them.
*  But we're still trying to figure out what this is and what kind of team should be put
*  with this person.
*  Does he need a point guard?
*  Does he need a rim protector next to him?
*  I don't know.
*  He's going to be 30 and we're still going to be figuring it out.
*  They're the anomalies that come into the league and we feel very dumb forever second guessing
*  where they would fit.
*  You know, like Draymond comes in, it's like, is he a three?
*  Is he a four?
*  Like, what is he supposed to do?
*  It's like, oh, obviously he's one of the defining small ball players of his generation.
*  Right.
*  Clearly that one worked out.
*  And then there are the anomalies that's just like, it never really is apparent where they
*  should be or what they should do or how they should play.
*  Like they always have some kind of very specific deficit in their game that makes it hard to
*  slot them in.
*  You know, if you have one of a kind players, sometimes you have to find other one of a
*  kind players to play with them.
*  And that can be a very challenging process for a team in the Pelicans position.
*  Like they have a ton of talent.
*  They have a lot of depth, certainly, especially when all their guys are healthy.
*  You know, they're they're dealing with some some shorthanding issues right now.
*  But ultimately, it's hard to even consent like conceptually think who is the best player
*  to put next to Zion.
*  What does that player look like?
*  How do you get them?
*  Every step in that process is hard.
*  I don't think it's Brandon Ingram.
*  I'll tell you that much.
*  Another guy, another unicorn guy, the ultimate unicorn, Wemba Nyama, who unfortunately the
*  league didn't get the memo in time to the refs.
*  Please don't put him in foul trouble during this first game.
*  People just want to watch him.
*  I think he's easier to fit around because he can play off the ball.
*  He can play with the ball.
*  He can play for he can play five.
*  He can protect the rim.
*  He could just be in the middle like how the Celtics use Porzingis or he can be in the
*  corner and jump out Rob Williams style.
*  Is it I think a better passer than any of us were prepared for from the from the weird
*  French highlights and the league like that.
*  But his stroke's nice.
*  He's just he's just further ahead than I was expecting.
*  And I think what I wasn't really fully expecting was how much I'm going to be watching
*  him this year because it's one of those like and I had the three TVs going.
*  If he's on one of the TVs, I can't really focus on anything else when he's in.
*  Like I really can't.
*  It's like having like one of your kids in a soccer game or something like you're just
*  kind of transfixed by it.
*  Did you feel that way?
*  Yeah, I mean, especially if you have that kind of multi-screen experience, there are
*  things where you're looking down, you're checking your phone, you're you're on your
*  computer, whatever, and you'll just kind of casually look up and the way he contests
*  a three pointer.
*  It's so exciting.
*  Wait, he's the most exciting three point contest or ever.
*  Incredibly so.
*  And it's like disorient it's legitimately disorienting where it's like I'm seeing a
*  movement on my screen.
*  I'm just not used to seeing a blur of arm going to this shot that's like hasn't
*  arced yet, but is very much in midair.
*  If you see, he almost blocked the Kyrie three at the end of the game last night.
*  He missed it by like a fingernail.
*  Absolutely insane.
*  But can you blame Kyrie for going for it?
*  Like you got to take that shot if you get that opportunity.
*  That would have been an incredible moment.
*  But I mean, I was looking ahead for this weekend.
*  Like who are the teams that I need to check in with early that I really want to see
*  rocket spurs?
*  I think his appointment viewing for me this weekend.
*  Like I really want to I really want to see what Houston looks like.
*  I've not a chance to check them out yet.
*  And Victor, especially against young teams, especially against other young bigs.
*  Like I just want to see those battles.
*  I want to see how these guys try to like comprehend everything that he can do and
*  figure out ways around him.
*  It's going to be such an interesting kind of like mental exercise all season long
*  for the most clever, the most skilled bigs in the league to just figure out what to
*  do with him.
*  Yeah.
*  And you could tell they're they're amused by it in like a way like, oh, my God, I
*  just can't believe this person exists.
