# The Clippers Are Dumb | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGlCNPwHePg)
*  The Clippers traded for James Harden late night.
*  They tried to do this as late as possible at night
*  when the most possible people were asleep
*  because they were embarrassed by this trade,
*  and they should be because they're the Clippers.
*  They haven't made the finals ever
*  in the history of the franchise,
*  dating back to Buffalo in 1970,
*  talking five and a half decades of bad luck,
*  terrible injuries, mismanagement.
*  We had the Donald Sterling piece of it.
*  We had load management the last couple years.
*  They've had some of the worst playoff losses
*  of the 21st century,
*  and now they're trading for a guy
*  who's quit on his last three teams.
*  So they decided, you know what,
*  we'll do this in the middle of the night
*  on the East Coast at least,
*  so we'll take the least amount of slack.
*  They were bidding against nobody.
*  There's 30 teams in the league.
*  One of them had James Harden.
*  28 other teams were like, we're good,
*  and the Clippers said, you know what,
*  we need this guy.
*  We'll still be not nearly as good as Denver,
*  but if we do this,
*  maybe we could lose in either round two
*  or round three maybe.
*  I just feel like they don't have any draft picks left
*  for the rest of the decade.
*  So they basically traded three picks for James Harden.
*  The worst one was a 2028 unprotected first.
*  They also traded a 2026 first
*  that they get a worse first back.
*  I didn't really understand that one,
*  and then they have a pick swap with Philly in 2029.
*  Philly can just take their pick if it's worse.
*  Why do this now?
*  Why do this for a team with no other offers?
*  Why bid against yourself?
*  And why not just wait?
*  If you know you're trading basically two and a half picks
*  plus all these expirings they had, why not wait?
*  The league, I don't know if you've watched it
*  the first week, the league is more talented
*  and more loaded than it's ever been,
*  probably in 30 years,
*  and there's a really, really, really good chance
*  that a couple teams that thought they were gonna be good
*  are not gonna be good.
*  For instance, Memphis is 0-4.
*  Is Memphis gonna go 25 and 57?
*  Probably not.
*  But there's gonna be a couple teams
*  that are just way worse than they expected,
*  and guess what happens after Thanksgiving
*  and in December and in January?
*  Those teams panic.
*  Guys become available.
*  What if Toronto is bad?
*  What if they're like, you know what, Pascal Siakam,
*  this just isn't working for us.
*  What if Chicago, who's already had two team meetings,
*  I think, in three games,
*  what if they decide to put Zach Levine on the table?
*  You just don't know.
*  What you do know now is that there was only one team
*  bidding for James Harden,
*  and the Clippers ended up with him anyway.
*  The other thing, if you're giving up this much for one guy,
*  I better know that I have a chance to actually win the title,
*  and I just don't feel like they do.
*  I went to the game Sunday night.
*  Kawhi, he looks fine.
*  He looks fine.
*  Does he look like the Kawhi from the mid-2010s?
*  No.
*  Does he look like the guy from 2019 Toronto?
*  He does not.
*  He looks like an older, playing himself back
*  in the shape version of Kawhi,
*  and if that's your best player,
*  that's just not gonna be enough this year.
*  The Celtics are too good.
*  Denver is too good.
*  Milwaukee has Giannis and Dame.
*  Phoenix has a ton of scoring.
*  Golden State's gonna be really good.
*  They're still not in the mix,
*  so that was my first issue.
*  The second one, who are you getting?
*  Who are you getting in this trade?
*  We're getting guys, including three teams.
*  You're getting the most disappointing
*  playoff star of this century.
*  Literally, this century,
*  and there's no other person you can put in there.
*  There's nobody who has even half of the qualifications
*  from a playoff disappointment standpoint
*  that this guy does.
*  Zach Lowe came on the Book of Basketball podcast,
*  I think in 2019, we did a James Harden podcast,
*  and in that podcast, which was four years ago,
*  called him the Karl Malone of guards,
*  and I was immediately the most jealous
*  I've ever been of a comparison.
*  Since then, he had the 2020 Bubble Flame Out,
*  then they had in 2022 the Miami Series,
*  which he sucked in, and then in 2023 the Celtics Series.
*  This guy, it's an all-time resume,
*  and the Clippers, who are just playoff futility
*  through and through for the entire franchise history,
*  we're like, that's the guy.
*  That's the guy that can take the lovable loser Clippers
*  over the top, James Harden.
*  He slows you down, he needs the ball all the time.
*  The Clippers now have Paul George,
*  who succeeds the most when he has the ball,
*  Kool-Aid Leonard, who has perennially succeeded the most
*  when he has the ball, Russell Westbrook,
*  who loves to either have the ball or crash the boards,
*  and now Harden, who needs the ball.
*  See, four guys who need the ball,
*  then Norm Powell comes in, he needs the ball,
*  Bones Highland comes in, he needs the ball.
*  Are we playing with three balls now?
*  No, we're gonna still play with one.
*  James Harden can't guard anybody, that seems relevant.
*  He hasn't played defense in four years.
*  There was an interesting, I've done two podcasts
*  with Doc Rivers this year, one was right after
*  the NBA Finals, and we talked about what happened
*  with Harden and Philly, and Doc made this point
*  that I thought was really interesting,
*  I actually thought it would be a bigger deal.
*  He said, when Harden didn't make the All-Star team,
*  he kinda changed how he played,
*  and started going for his stats a little bit more,
*  was the implication.
*  He was really unselfish up until the All-Star break,
*  then he didn't make the team,
*  and then it just got a little rocky after that.
*  The Sixers, for the last three-fourths of the season,
*  I think were 46 and 19, so it's not like they were bad.
*  But it was always a little tug of war with him after that,
*  because you want unselfish James Harden
*  on a really good team, you want him just being like,
*  I'll set everybody up, I'll actually play
*  a little bit harder on defense,
*  but we've only seen that guy intermittently,
*  that's the guy he has to be on this Cooper's team.
*  At this age, age 34, going into a contract extension,
*  or whatever the hell is gonna happen this summer,
*  you know Ballmer's gonna extend him.
*  He won't be able to help himself.
*  I'm just dubious that he's gonna be like,
*  I'm just here to help us win.
*  We've only seen him do that for little spurts.
*  Probably the most heroic version of that was 2021
*  with the Nets, when they had those injuries,
*  and he was playing hurt, but I actually really like
*  the way he played that year.
*  For the most part, it is James Harden.
*  The results are always disappointing with him,
*  and he's getting older, so congratulations on getting that.
*  Third question for me, or third point,
*  can you beat Denver or Boston with this team you have?
*  I don't know if you watched Denver this year,
*  they look amazing.
*  This is the classic, won a championship,
*  kept the nucleus together, they're better than ever.
*  They have the best part in the world, it's not even close.
*  He's just awesome night after night.
*  Everything he does permeates with this team
*  in all the best possible ways.
*  And you just can't tell me that Kawhi, Paul George,
*  James Harden, PJ Tucker, Zubach,
*  they're not beating Denver, it's not happening.
*  So if you're not beating Denver with the team you have,
*  why are you making the trade in the first place?
*  So they have Kawhi, Paul George, Harden, man,
*  Terrence Mann, Norm Powell, Russ, Zubach, Plumlee,
*  and Tucker, I guess would be their nine.
*  I really liked how Westbrook was playing for them.
*  Now again, you're not gonna win the title
*  if he's prominently involved with your team,
*  but now you're bringing Harden in, you kill Westbrook now.
*  He's coming off the bench, he's just not gonna be the same.
*  Now he's worried about how many minutes he's getting,
*  he's gonna want the ball, you've killed that piece of it.
*  So you've added Harden, but you've also probably killed
*  the Westbrook part of your season.
*  You're also not durable even before you got James Harden,
*  who God only knows if he's gonna be able to stay healthy.
*  Paul George's last four years, he missed 24 games,
*  18 games, 51 games, 26 games.
*  Kawhi's last six years, 73, 22, 15, 20, 82,
*  and 30 games missed.
*  You have four older stars past their primes.
*  Paul George, 33, Kawhi, 32, Harden, 34,
*  Russell Westbrook, 35, Norm Powell, young legs at 30.
*  All right, let's say this works.
*  Let's say they actually all play really well together.
*  What is in the history of the NBA?
*  Have we seen a team with an older nucleus like this?
*  And it is an old nucleus.
*  Have we seen an older nucleus team actually win the title?
*  Which I guess would be the point of this trade
*  and all the other trades because they've traded
*  all of their firsts for an entire decade.
*  Best comparison you might go to is the 2011 Mavs.
*  Dirk was 32, Marion was 32, Jason Terry was 33,
*  Jason Cade was 37, and Tyson Chandler was 28.
*  I don't see Dirk Nowitzki on this team, just for the record.
*  I don't see 2011 Dirk Nowitzki.
*  I think Kawhi, maybe a couple surgeries ago,
*  but not this version of Kawhi,
*  who's been under the knife a few times.
*  But that would be your best case scenario.
*  That team also won with defense,
*  and they had one great scorer.
*  This team is trying to win with offense
*  and really no defense whatsoever.
*  Good luck.
*  Other teams possibly, like the 1978 Washington team,
*  they had Elvin Hayes, 32, Wes Unseld, 31,
*  and Bobby Dandridge, 30, but that was in the 70s
*  and when those ages were old, they won the title.
*  It was 45 years ago.
*  The 95 Houston team had Hakim and Clyde at age 32 each,
*  but they were a little younger in different parts.
*  But then if you're just looking at recent history
*  of older teams that had just a nucleus of guys
*  who were all, we could all agree, past their primes,
*  past their peaks, the 2012 Celtics, I think,
*  are a good example.
*  They almost beat Miami, but when push came to shove,
*  Miami just had players that were at better points
*  in their careers.
*  2000s Utah, like right after they made the finals,
*  two years in a row, and then that 99, 2000, 2001,
*  kind of the end of Malone and Stockton,
*  they were in the mix, but they were just older.
*  They weren't the same team.
*  2010 Phoenix, I think, is a really good comp for this.
*  Nash, the last really great Nash season,
*  the second to last really good Amari season,
*  they were just kind of at the tail end of the rope.
*  In general, you don't wanna be from an age range
*  where this team is, where you don't have that one guy
*  who you know we can count on for four straight playoffs.
*  Maybe it's Paul George.
*  He's also somebody who's had a lot of injuries.
*  By the way, I don't know when he's gonna have the ball
*  on this team.
*  Paul George is probably my favorite all around player
*  on this team and might have the fourth usage rate
*  per minute of all of these dudes.
*  Anyway, all right.
*  Fourth point I wanted to make, the Clippers,
*  owned by Steve Ballmer, nice guy, been on this podcast,
*  and spends money and assets like he's playing 2K.
*  So Ballmer's basically traded all of their picks
*  in the 2020s.
*  It's, I think, five unprotected firsts, three swaps,
*  and then there's one where they get the lower version
*  of something.
*  They just don't have their own good pick
*  except for 2030, which is seven years from now.
*  They traded Shade Gilgis Alexander.
*  Kind of a big deal.
*  He's one of the 10 best guys in the league now.
*  He was in the Kawhi trade.
*  They didn't know he'd become this,
*  but when you say they went all in,
*  like they went all in in ways that I don't know
*  if any NBA team in the history of the league
*  has gone all in.
*  All the picks they gave up, trading SGA,
*  trading Gallinari when he actually had value,
*  from a luxury tax standpoint,
*  they paid 89 million combined in 2022 and 2021.
*  They paid 140 million in luxury tax last year.
*  This is on top of their salary cap.
*  This year they're on pace for at least 128.
*  So just the last two years,
*  they're close to 270 million for luxury tax
*  last year and this year.
*  This is a team that might not make it out of round one
*  for the record.
*  Then you have the playoff resume
*  of last year they lost in round one.
*  In 2022 they missed the playoffs.
*  2021 they had a chance to make the finals
*  and Kawhi gets hurt again
*  and they lose in the Western Conference finals.
*  And then 2020 they lost in round two, they were healthy
*  and they choked against Denver.
*  They choked away a 3-1 lead.
*  Everyone, including me, has been saying,
*  well they gotta do something.
*  They got the new arena coming.
*  I don't know if this was the something.
*  I think they feel like they need to do something
*  because they have this new arena coming.
*  But the problem is,
*  no one cares about the Quippers in Los Angeles.
*  They haven't forever.
*  Forever.
*  It's a Lakers town, it's a Dodgers town,
*  it's a USC versus UCLA town.
*  It's like a whiff of Kings, there's a whiff of Rams.
*  They're kind of in that Kings Rams,
*  but even then they probably don't have
*  the same kind of diehard fans.
*  They have this self-imposed pressure to matter
*  because this town has such DNA
*  with the Lakers and Dodgers and the college teams,
*  but also it's a star-driven town.
*  And the theory is, if we get stars, the people come out.
*  So if you start with the COVID year, 2019-20,
*  the year they got Kawhi and Paul George,
*  they've had this kind of self-imposed pressure
*  to stand out against the Lakers,
*  which is fool's gold because they're the Lakers.
*  They're always gonna win in LA.
*  It's the same thing the Nets did this in New York
*  with competing against the Knicks.
*  And even when they had Durant and Kyrie
*  and they got Harden and Brooklyn seemed like a thing,
*  people still cared more about the Knicks.
*  You're just never gonna win this.
*  You can't beat 60, 70, 80 years of history.
*  You can't beat generations of families
*  that have had the ticket.
*  You're just not winning that one.
*  Now the Clippers feel like,
*  well, we're gonna have this new awesome basketball arena.
*  Maybe that'll work.
*  Trying to remember when an arena
*  became the number one drawing point for a team,
*  maybe the Cowboys, but the Cowboys were also the Cowboys,
*  the most famous football team we have.
*  You could argue they were better off
*  instead of trading the rest of their assets for Harden.
*  You could argue that they were better off
*  maybe shopping Kawhi and Paul George
*  and packing in and trying to get into the luxury tax
*  and do the whole thing, but they couldn't do that
*  because Ballmer doesn't want to
*  because he's got incredible amounts of money
*  and he's convinced himself that he can put these four guys,
*  all of whom are past their prime, on a team together,
*  maybe they'll win the title.
*  Well, spoiler alert, it's not gonna happen.
*  Last thing,
*  Clippers with Harden is really peak Clipper.
*  And as I've talked about many times,
*  I've had season tickets since my 20th year.
*  I wrote a piece for Page Two in 2009
*  called The Curse of the Clippers.
*  And the point of that piece was Blake Griffin
*  was talking about this is a new era,
*  I don't care what happened in the past.
*  I basically like poo-pooed any sort of bad karma
*  with the Clippers.
*  And what happened?
*  Blake Griffin hurt his knee that summer
*  and didn't play his rookie year.
*  And this was after I wrote the piece about,
*  oh Blake, you gotta be careful,
*  you don't know what you're walking into here.
*  This team has had a black cloud around it
*  for the entire time it's existed.
*  We thought it was Donald Sterling was the black cloud.
*  And yet, when they finally got rid of him the next year,
*  they had their worst playoff loss,
*  not only in Clippers history,
*  but it was probably the second worst playoff loss
*  of this entire century behind the Spurs heat game.
*  They have had so many bad moments and so much bad luck
*  that it weirdly comes back to Harden
*  because the worst of all those losses
*  was game six, 2015 against Houston.
*  Harden stinks in a must-win game,
*  I mean, go figure, goes to the bench,
*  I'm at the game, he puts a towel over his head,
*  the game's done, Clippers are up by 20,
*  heading into the end of third quarter.
*  And Josh Schmitt, Corey Brewer, Trevor Ariza,
*  they're basically just jacking up threes
*  to keep Houston in it.
*  And what happens?
*  They start coming back, the crowd gets tight.
*  Josh Schmitt makes a three, Corey Brewer makes a three,
*  all of a sudden they have energy,
*  now the towel is off Harden's head.
*  They have the best comeback,
*  or one of the best comebacks in Rockets history
*  and the worst comeback loss in Clippers history
*  with Harden mostly watching from the bench.
*  So he is this bystander to this horrible,
*  horrible event for the Clippers
*  and now they just traded for him.
*  Now he's on their team.
*  I don't agree with the trade, I don't think it will work,
*  and I think James Harden has been telling us
*  for the last 10 to 12 years who he is.
*  I think Paul George and Kawhi Leonard physically
*  have been telling us where their bodies are,
*  and I don't see any chance that they beat Denver
*  in the playoffs series.
*  You would have to have injuries in the Denver side
*  for it to become realistic.
*  So needless to say, thumbs down from me
*  on the James Harden trade from a Clippers perspective.
