# NBA OverUnders Part 3 The CelticsHeat Divisions  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2BQ4okHiNs)
*  We're doing the Atlantic division.
*  That's our second to last one.
*  And that is led by the Boston Celtics who won the NBA title last year, who
*  won 64 and 18, they're over under his 58 and a half wins.
*  They were minus 135 for the division plus three 20 for the title plus one 20 to
*  be the one seed, which I would encourage as a bet.
*  Rossello, how is this team six wins worse?
*  Yeah, they even played below their expected, expected by like a couple.
*  Um, I don't really know.
*  I don't, maybe the Al Horford year finally happens where he falls apart.
*  Um, maybe there's a Jaylen Brown post Olympic push of like, I'm the man and
*  it gets in the way of something, maybe a little me, me, me action.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, you're asking me and I'm not saying these are going to happen, but
*  I'm trying to figure out how it's.
*  Poor Zingas gets pushed back to February, December, then it's 56 wins.
*  You know, I don't, it's an over for me.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's a tiny under for me.
*  Cause 58 wins is not disrespectful.
*  Um, and the way that there are six games worse is what Mr.
*  Rossello just laid out.
*  Uh, I also think an element to this that's fair to contemplate is Tatum's a little
*  tired, right?
*  Just played the most basketball competitive basketball he's ever played in his life.
*  Not in the Olympics, except for not in the Olympics.
*  Right.
*  But he was there.
*  He was feeling great there.
*  He had to be there.
*  He did practice and all that.
*  He didn't get the game minutes, but, um, that's the thesis for it.
*  Uh, and really or that he can't shoot anymore.
*  No, he fixed that.
*  Cause what you're asking for.
*  Okay.
*  With Horford as we go on, you know, you go from Horford, isn't it?
*  David or Tillman and Cornett if, if, if that's where we go high hopes for Tillman.
*  Okay.
*  Honestly, like that's all Denver would kill for Tillman.
*  Yeah, they would.
*  That's not even a joke.
*  You're right.
*  I'm serious.
*  Yeah.
*  So, uh, I don't know how he fit with Jokic, but anyway, um,
*  I was looking at the under all off season because of the Tatum Olympics stuff, the
*  possible disease of more, which you always have to think about with every title team.
*  Um, the sale I think is a real thing for the organization and just as just an X
*  factor, it makes me nervous.
*  I don't think the players care about it, but I think it brings an instability to
*  the whole atmosphere when you, you know, you have, you don't know where you're
*  getting, right?
*  And some new guy comes in in January.
*  It's like, here are my ideas.
*  I don't know.
*  It just makes me nervous.
*  Right.
*  What about then the, then the, I offered here, I think, you know, we keep saying
*  it's just happened three years ago.
*  You keep saying it's not going to happen, but at some point it's going to happen.
*  I think they're, they figured out.
*  So the reason I went over is because their infrastructure is so solid with the
*  durability of their best players, right?
*  Tatum and Brown.
*  Um, they're going to be able to spot Horford and White.
*  They have this crazy bench, but I just think they know who they are.
*  This is like, we're bomb and threes.
*  We're built around these two really special wing guys.
*  Um, we are above average at literally every single defensive position.
*  We are high above average as three point shooters.
*  And I just think the infrastructure that they have built, at least for this
*  season, is going to be intact.
*  So to me, it's a 61 team.
*  I don't really have a rebuttal to that.
*  Like the only other sort of aspect to this is a little bit of injury, bad luck
*  maybe, because if holiday goes out for any holiday is 35, for 38, poor Zingas.
*  We don't know.
*  I, again, I'm, I love the Boston Celtics.
*  I think they're tremendous.
*  No, I think your right to be hesitant.
*  57 is not, oh, this is so disappointing.
*  But I got it.
*  That's all I got it.
*  But I just think that there's a gap when everything's right in the East.
*  I don't know why anybody would refute that.
*  Um, and the two most important guys, maybe the three most important guys are
*  that durable if you put White in the conversation.
*  The durability is nuts and really unusual.
*  And it's the reason that we liked OKC too.
*  And younger guys who just play all the time, I like that for the over.
*  Do you factor in anything like the Knicks and Sixers games are going to be high
*  effing wattage, like they're going to get the national, you know, those are going to be.
*  I think they can get up for Andre Drummond.
*  So good.
*  And they've played Ubre before.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they have.
*  That's a great point.
*  Um, I, they know Yabucelli's game.
*  They brought him in.
*  Yeah, they know Yabu.
*  I want to say one other thing about this, so it's too, I really, the Missoula thing,
*  the Missoula arc has been one of the most unusual arcs as a sports fan that I've ever
*  had where they take this guy, my dad called him second row Joe.
*  I thought he was completely overmatched and overwhelmed.
*  And then over the second year, I thought he did a really good job, especially in the
*  playoffs and now the off season stuff, the leadership that he has behind the scenes,
*  like the way those guys look up for him, the way he looks out for them.
*  You know, he flew to France when Tatum was in a functor in the Olympics.
*  Um, I think all he cares about is winning titles and having this team be awesome.
*  He's like actually kind of a psycho in a good way.
*  And, uh, and I think, I just think he knows how to push their buttons.
*  I think he's a very unusual coach in this day and age where he's young enough that
*  he can fit in with the players, but kind of an older soul where, yeah, I'm around
*  your age, but, and I don't know, I just think they listen to him.
*  I think he might have a chance to be a really special coach, which if you had
*  shown a clip of me talking about this 18 months ago, I would have been like, I am
*  being drugged and I'm in Bulgaria with a gun pointed at me from 10 feet away.
*  But I think he has a chance to be a special coach.
*  Do you think I'm crazy on that?
*  Well, I just know that if the results were different, I don't think you would
*  be saying anything you just said.
*  Well, true.
*  I am a results guy.
*  Well, which results?
*  They, they, it was a historically dominant run through the playoffs.
*  Yeah.
*  I just think if they had like come up short with this offense that at times in
*  regular season was sort of frustrating for a team that had this profile, you
*  would, I don't know, man, I think.
*  There's a lot of not easy things to coach with this team though, that I
*  thought he navigated last year.
*  Like Tate, that Tatum was really strange offensively in the playoffs.
*  Like he could not get it going.
*  Right.
*  And I think there was a world where.
*  But I think he was the focal point of what everybody was doing that Tatum, I
*  thought Tatum had better games as it went a lot.
*  People gave him credit for like his overall numbers are not going to show.
*  Like he was running their offense and then playing center on defense.
*  So I, I'm with you on the Missoula creativity part of it.
*  And the fact that it's Brad, that it's this ownership, that it's the different
*  people that you've met over the years that worked for the team.
*  This is a very smart organization.
*  So there was no way they're going to hand the keys to somebody that was like,
*  Oh, he's sort of quirky and younger.
*  So like that's because there was a lot of teams just hiring the cool younger
*  assistant, and then once they made him the head coach, you would hear like, uh,
*  Oh, like he's, he's just, I mean, it's not even an insult to say somebody might
*  not be ready with that background from it, but I just, you know, everybody's
*  going to say we're homers for it, but we know some of these people.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have also, I was pretty critical of him the last couple of years.
*  I, I do think.
*  I just think post email, they weren't going to go like, let's just do something
*  stupid now.
*  Right.
*  But I do wonder with the league.
*  I think it's the hardest it's ever been to coach in the NBA, right?
*  These guys, especially as the money keeps going up for the players and as the
*  swipe rate generation has just come in where it's like, I was unhappy this year.
*  I'd like to be traded now.
*  Or I'd like to sign and people are just jumping around.
*  Look at Paul George, four or five years of, you know, didn't go great in the
*  Quippers, but it went pretty well.
*  Like they made a conference finals.
*  Like they were relevant and he's just like, I'm out.
*  They wouldn't give me a fourth year.
*  Now I'm going to go to this new team.
*  I can't blame him for it.
*  I don't blame him.
*  He has his injuries.
*  Yeah.
*  He's took the extra year.
*  Rational economic actor, but guys jump around more than ever.
*  And I think it's really hard to coach and it's hard to navigate the social
*  media era and the way to do it, which I think he stumbled into in a really
*  smart way is just, he really has real relationships with these dudes and they
*  trust him and he uses like game 52 of some random season and be like,
*  I'm going to play Peyton Pritchard 38 minutes tonight and he's going to
*  fucking cook and I'm going to build his confidence up.
*  Like he's smart.
*  The way they approach a regular season is the model for, I think how a lot of
*  teams are going to do this now where they're like, we want this 12 band roster.
*  We're going to give guys nights off and then our ninth or 10th guy is going to
*  jump in and we're going to fucking let this guy cook and tell them we believe in them.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's a really hard, I don't think it's ever been harder to be an NBA
*  coach, except for maybe the cocaine era.
*  When you're like, where's Mike array?
*  I don't know.
*  He missed practice again.
*  Oh man.
*  Oh God.
*  I think there's more of a disconnect now.
*  I mean, it just makes more sense that like, I don't, you want to create
*  something where people feel like they would have a responsibility and now I
*  think it's just, let me try to get the contract and then I'll go wherever I want.
*  Anyway.
*  So.
*  If this is a fun conversation, you could do it over.
*  You guys do it over the course of the season, but, um, you know, the, the
*  nature of professional basketball now is very different than, than how it was
*  seven years ago, 14 years ago.
*  So I think that's, you know, an important element of what you're observing here.
*  How do you tell all 12 of these guys that this is going to be fine?
*  And they all believe it.
*  How well, and also what kind of guys are you putting on your team that
*  are going to buy into that?
*  Right.
*  Like for set is somebody, I think that was a really popular teammate last year.
*  Right.
*  He was really, really close, a big part behind the scenes of the team, but he
*  just wasn't a good enough shooter.
*  Right.
*  So now that's like, we're going to get Lonnie Walker because we want everybody
*  on this team to be able to shoot everyone on this team knows what the agenda of
*  the team is we want to defend, we want to shoot threes, we want to be able to slash
*  and kick, um, I just, I've been really impressed.
*  I've been impressed by the off season because I am on disease of more watch
*  every time a team wins a title.
*  It's like, what can go wrong?
*  You know, the Jalen Jason thing, um, they have navigated that a bit as
*  well as it could possibly be navigated.
*  There's so many different situations over the last few years when those guys
*  could have turned on each other, gotten pissy about it.
*  I thought there was a selflessness with them that you need that I want to talk
*  about with a team coming up after this next team.
*  Um, so over for me over for Rossello under for house next 53 and a half plus
*  230 for the division plus three 70 for the conference, 60 plus wins house three
*  plus three 25 last year there are 50 and 32 now they're a plus seven 50 for the
*  title they added Carl Anthony towns, McHale bridges and campaign the new big
*  three and daddy a and Tyler Colick.
*  I mean, they lost Julius Randall and Dante DeFincenzo.
*  They're starting to line up as towns in and it'll be heart bridges and Brunson.
*  It's where we get to the bench that I get a little nervous.
*  We're so McBride, precious Mitchell Robinson who plays half the season pain.
*  I've seen him.
*  Sham it.
*  Jericho Sims, Colick.
*  This is a team built around four guys, basically plus heart.
*  Two of those four guys just miss a lot of games towns and in an OB and that's
*  my fear with the over under I'm a slight under.
*  Well, I, you know, their injury history with the two guys, I mean, oh geez,
*  just now that he has a contract, I'm wondering how to take a week off.
*  Take a week off here.
*  I'm going over.
*  I think that the second best team in the East, uh, you know, some of the stats
*  over from last year, it's not going to be the same because they're not going to
*  have the same defensive numbers with the two headed monster of Mitchell and
*  Hartenstein.
*  So I just, I just love the way the pieces fit together and the cat need was so
*  significant and it's really funny to you.
*  You think of all the years of rumors of how the Knicks had staffed, like they're
*  going to get the Louisville guys.
*  They're going to get the Kentucky guys because this guy recruited Donovan
*  Mitchell and this guy knows Booker and then this guy knows tens.
*  Like it finally happened after years of it never happening.
*  And I think towns who again, not my favorite, we're a little worried about
*  the New York part of it.
*  A little he's, he's accepted into motion already with what was his franchise and
*  now he's going to somebody else's franchise.
*  So if it's a lot of like, Hey, space, the floor hit 40% of three, but you're not
*  going to be asked to be bailing us out of his kind of possessions because you
*  already have Brunson bridges who, when he first got traded to Brooklyn, showed us
*  a version of his offense that I wasn't even sure like he could sustain.
*  And then cam Thomas fucked it all up.
*  Um, and OG, you know, his shooting numbers, especially from the corner
*  stuff is really, really good.
*  He'll, he'll have some moments, even though I think we'll still think there's
*  like some creative limitations with him, but there's a really nice compliment of
*  pieces here where I like it.
*  And Brunson is a superstar.
*  I mean, Brunson took it to a level that it's almost like he's mini Luca.
*  He understands the angles.
*  He understands the footwork.
*  He, even when you think you've got him, you don't have him.
*  And that six or series is one of my favorite series of the last few years.
*  Cause it just, the intensity of whole thing.
*  So like, look, great coach, some pieces.
*  Sure.
*  The injury stuff.
*  I got it.
*  Mitchell, the TBD, but man, I like how the, even with Divenchenza moving on, I'm
*  not sure if they had the minutes in this new rotation with Bridges being there and
*  Hart and OG and the right to be happy.
*  Yeah.
*  He might've been miserable in this situation.
*  So, um, that's somebody who doesn't like Kat saying, I think the Knicks.
*  And I also think that their, their wing defender options are better than
*  Philly, better than Cleveland.
*  Certainly.
*  Um, better than the Pacers are terrible defensively when you start talking
*  about matching up with Boston.
*  That was your longest monologue of the three parts.
*  I don't know.
*  You were passionate about the Knicks.
*  No, they're super fun.
*  They are the second best TBDs.
*  They're super fun.
*  That six or series was so much fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have over or under?
*  Under, because I think they're going to go 53 and 29.
*  And I think they're going to go 53 and 29.
*  Cause I think that, um, both OG and Kat are going to miss time and they have
*  nothing, nothing, I think it's going to take some time.
*  For them to reclaim the, um, interior defense identity that really
*  propelled them down the stretch.
*  That's a great point.
*  He was.
*  Hartenstein can, it can't be overstated how impactful he was both to like the
*  identity of the team, but like the function, the offensive rebounding, the
*  interior, like he's so goddamn smart.
*  It's why, I mean, we're going to have to, I'm going to bet a bunch of Oklahoma
*  city, like 60 wins, 65 wins.
*  I'm going to be in all that because of how smart that dude is.
*  And I just think it'll take, Tim's is fucking killer.
*  They're, they're going to be fine.
*  So 53 and 29 is not disrespectful.
*  I don't think New York fans, I don't think 53 and 29 is disrespectful.
*  It's just a tiny under for me because of the injury risk.
*  I think I'm mix of both of you guys.
*  Cause I really liked this next team.
*  I liked them more as a playoff team than a regular season team.
*  Yeah.
*  I think maybe that's leaking into my thing a little too.
*  Yeah.
*  I agree with that.
*  Me going under on this team says nothing about my fear for them in the playoffs.
*  Cause I think they're going to be super dangerous.
*  I just, when, when you're talking about Andy and Obi in towns, just having a
*  pretty established history now missing games.
*  And I don't think this team has a lot of room for error in the regular season.
*  The playoffs is not going to matter.
*  Precious McBride, Ariel Huckporty.
*  I think this is the Celtics biggest threat in the East.
*  Totally agree.
*  Yeah.
*  We're all on the same page.
*  Cleveland is going to maybe be a better regular season team, but this is the team.
*  They're built a lot like Minnesota last year.
*  They're, they're put together to try to beat the Celtics team and they're going
*  to have the best chance at it because they're going to be able to defend the two
*  guys towns is weird, hard guy to play against kind of kind of mirror image or
*  poor Zingas and, uh, and we'll see if Brunson can do it again.
*  Cause that was a lot of miles they put on him last year.
*  I always worry about these smaller players just with these gigantic usage rates.
*  You know, that's just a lot, just a lot different when you're six feet, just
*  banging into these big bodies for eight months.
*  But yeah, I like I I'm under, but to me, the conference plus three 70 is probably
*  a little more interesting or the title.
*  Plus I would write, if I was playing next odds, I would probably play the future odds.
*  I think they just have to beat the Celtics.
*  Yeah.
*  I bet them to win the division and I got a better price than the plus two 30.
*  I mean, all these numbers are inflated because everybody in New York loves
*  his team also, especially after Kat.
*  Like the over is minus one 18.
*  Like they're steaming the over at 53 and a half.
*  Um, the Bridges piece is going to be interesting though, because if you're a
*  casual basketball fan, you could go to a Knicks game and Bridges will have like
*  six points and two rebounds and do a lot of subtle stuff that you're like, wait,
*  I thought we traded five first round picks for this guy.
*  Yeah.
*  What does this guy do?
*  And admit it's like, we all know how good he is.
*  Yeah.
*  When he did, I, I was so impressed with his shot making off the dribble, all on
*  his own for that stretch of Brooklyn two years ago that I think he just kind of
*  was like, all right, Cam, if you just want to take a million shots, like I'm
*  I'll be over here.
*  I'm over it.
*  This whole team stinks anyway.
*  I don't want to get hurt.
*  Um, so I don't, you know, it's not about, there's going to be nights where it's a
*  bunch of, it's the option of like, it's probably the three guys, but like if
*  Bridges gets 30 instead of Brunson, it's not surprising when Kat gets 30 instead
*  of Brunson, it's not going to be surprising.
*  Oh geez.
*  Good for a couple blow up games, you know, every, every few weeks.
*  Right.
*  And then Hart just dials it up.
*  So it's, um, so it's a nice team playoff wise.
*  I totally, we're all aligned.
*  One other thing with them, cause I really do think they're going to miss Steve
*  Vincenzo, like I don't think that's a hot take.
*  I just didn't know where the minutes were going to be for.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think, but maybe he would have played crunch time over hard.
*  It just, he gave them more options, but I do wonder February, could they
*  find somebody in the market and you, we go through this every year when we do
*  the February pods and we're like, Oh, it seems like so good on paper to get a
*  buyout guy and then who are the bio guys that have actually been made a difference.
*  It's pretty rare.
*  If you're a bio guy and you want to win a title and you get to go to New York.
*  And if you're like a, you know, a swing who can shoot threes, this would be the
*  team you'd want to go to because you play, you play 15, 20 minutes and
*  maybe have some big moments.
*  All right.
*  Philadelphia over under 50 and a half division plus three 80 conference, five
*  to one title, 10 to one best record, 12 to one, one seed, six to one.
*  They were 47 and 35 last year.
*  They had a Paul George and a bunch of new guys, Gordon, Yabasele,
*  Andre German's back, my guy, McCain.
*  Caleb Martin's on the team now.
*  KJ Martin.
*  KJ Martin.
*  Oh, it was kind of like, um, I'll let you, I'll let you have the floor,
*  Brasila.
*  I think what Darrell Morey in this front office did was incredible.
*  Although if we want to go, let's give front offices credit.
*  If you go through the timeline of what the Knicks did in such a short amount of
*  time of who they were and who they are now, that is also incredible.
*  But if you want to start talking about like the false hope of cap space and the
*  number of fan bases around the country that were like, remember when we were
*  getting cap space?
*  Right.
*  Remember we thought we almost got the rant that one year and we didn't.
*  Then it didn't happen.
*  Uh, they did it.
*  They threaded the thinnest of needles.
*  And then because of the excitement around that, um, you know, they added all these
*  other pieces, you know, some of it, I think, you know, the Yabasele part of it was
*  like, he was so good in the Olympics and then everybody's like really excited about
*  it.
*  Um, but they had a plan.
*  They had the two guys under contract.
*  They delayed the maxi thing.
*  Like it worked.
*  It worked in a way that every other team seems to hope it would.
*  And it rarely ever works this way.
*  Having said that I'm totally over them.
*  Um, I'm, and bead is not like in a Westbrook thing for me, but he's starting
*  to head there a little and that's, that's, that hurts me because I've always really
*  liked them bead.
*  Like when I would get into Westbrook arguments with people like, you know, what
*  at 12, um, and beads quotes the last couple of years, like, I still think the
*  people closest to him keep telling him like how everybody's like wronging him or
*  anything.
*  And, um, I'll admit to this is like way too much and this is wrong, but to see him
*  foul hunting in the Olympics games, like the first few possessions he got in and
*  then not get them, you just sit home and be like, are you fucking serious, dude?
*  Are you seriously foul baiting this?
*  Like get out there and play basketball and you know, it's not just the injury part.
*  And if you can't see it, it's going to sound arrogant.
*  I can't help you.
*  But the possessions where he wanted nothing to do with the ball against the
*  Knicks in that first round series, it was haunting.
*  It reminded me of the other guys where when I see it, I go, Oh no.
*  And sometimes it's younger players and they get through that.
*  Shay Gilder's Alexander and that Houston, okay.
*  See matchup didn't look super comfortable.
*  Hey, it was first run through it.
*  Doesn't matter.
*  Now we're talking to MVPs for the guy and beat is too old and too established.
*  And look, extremely talented.
*  He's awesome.
*  He can do all that.
*  I might've been voting for him for MVP again, but I'm really sick of all of the
*  stuff around it.
*  And I just think he'll probably get hurt again.
*  It's tough when they do this whole, we're going to take it easy with them be this
*  year during the regular season because it's about titles now.
*  How about the third round?
*  When I hear that, I'm just like, Oh man, I don't know if they get it.
*  First of all, I don't say that out loud.
*  Second, why wasn't it always about titles?
*  What was it about titles last year and two years ago?
*  And by the way, your teams were pretty good the last couple of years.
*  These have been good teams.
*  Like now I'm in, I've got a much better shape this year, which is what we've
*  wanted from him forever.
*  I want to let him beat.
*  He seems like a great guy, but I there's, I don't know if it's the people around
*  him or what's going on, but I think it's the people around a little bit.
*  Sometimes it doesn't seem like he gets it.
*  No, the Duncan thing we'd even brought up because anybody that loves the game goes,
*  this is what one of the smartest things that Duncan ever did.
*  I'm going to have to see some blood work before I'm ready to sign off on like,
*  Hey, he just mirrored what Duncan did.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's see, can we have a couple of weeks?
*  House, where are you standing?
*  Oh, this is the hardest team, uh, by a long shot for me.
*  Because I absolutely echo what Mr.
*  Rousselaou, you know, observed.
*  I mean, they talk about like here where they are, they're 34 and 33 in
*  playoff games since this whole thing has been reinvented.
*  Sorry.
*  No, no, I appreciate it.
*  And in beads played 433 games in 10 years.
*  He's 30 years old.
*  He's never made the Eastern conference finals.
*  He's won five playoff series and he's missing the preseason and now saying
*  he's not going to play back to backs.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  Just be healthy in April.
*  Show up with 10.
*  We all agree on that.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  So what do you do with, with, with this win total?
*  Well, because all of the pieces that they added, I thought were like really good,
*  smart, you know, additive pieces, pieces that are going to help you win playoff
*  gains, like, you know, is, is, uh, Caleb Martin going to help them on a Thursday
*  night against, I don't know, the Pelicans.
*  So if we think like, let's go best case scenario games played for
*  Embiid and Paul George, the total number combined of those two, you can even go
*  separate 60, 60, like 60, right?
*  If you said 60 and a half today, Paul George has a knee bruise, which
*  is fucking secretly brutal.
*  And Embiid is, we don't even know if he's going to play an opening night.
*  By the way, I would be totally done with this team.
*  While also complimenting the strategy of finding anyone.
*  Like if it weren't for Maxey, Maxey's the piece that actually, because of his
*  personality, the way his game has taken off, where he might just be like, all
*  right, guys, I got enough of this.
*  Like I, to watch Embiid foul hunt fall all night.
*  And then he was like really dirty against the Knicks too, which that
*  doesn't bother me as much in the playoffs, but he just was, it was weird.
*  It was turned into lamb bearish.
*  It was a really weird series for him because then he'd be unstoppable and all
*  this stuff and it's like, what is, what is the goal here?
*  Like, cause I wanted them to play Boston.
*  I wanted to see Philly against Boston because Embiid having to chase
*  Prezengis and close out to him five beat.
*  Like Embiid would have retired.
*  Like I have to go all the way out here and chase him and then recover.
*  Like it's not happening.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  How's, does he learn anything from the Olympics?
*  Coming through a couple of times?
*  Yes.
*  I would say so.
*  And surrounded by those guys and surrounded by the coaching staff.
*  What did he learn?
*  They don't give him those bullshit calls against Senegal.
*  FIBA basketball rules are the best rules.
*  Like let's go hire all the FIBA referees.
*  Let's just fire all the referees in the NBA.
*  I think he did it so he can bolster the individual resume.
*  Now he's got the Olympic gold and it was going to be way easier with the United States.
*  I have, you know, I mean, are we really going to pretend that we're
*  really going to pretend it's anything other than that?
*  No, no.
*  I have real concerns about them as a playoff team.
*  If the crunch time lineup is Embiid, Caleb Martin, Paul George, Ubre and Maxey.
*  Which I assume that would be it because even he saw in the Olympics last year, I
*  just think Embiid's slow to the ball.
*  I think you can offensive rebound him to death.
*  Right.
*  And if the other players on the court are going to be Caleb Martin, Paul George, Ubre
*  and Maxey, I just think they're going to I don't think they're going to get big
*  rebounds when it matters.
*  That was why they lost the Knicks series.
*  What I do like and I was looking at like shot quality for guys and maybe I'll save
*  it for Paulo, but Maxey's volume went up, but the quality went down.
*  And I think he had those stretches without Embiid.
*  I'm blown away by Maxey, not just the development.
*  I think he's got the right personality for all this stuff.
*  And it looks like they do have a bunch of options.
*  And if McCain, like the Sixers ending up with McCain, there's a chance that it's
*  pretty good. You're miserable about it.
*  Yeah, I'm mad about that.
*  But I I would hope that with George is the guy on the wing and Ubre was terrific for
*  him. But having Paul George, at least in the regular season, as we'll see that the
*  Maxey attempts may go down, but the quality should go up because it felt like Maxey was
*  saving their ass offensively so many different times.
*  And he still put up all these terrific numbers.
*  I voted as an All-Star starter, but the efficiency on some of the stuff wasn't as good
*  as maybe you would think it would be for how good it was.
*  I think he just was stuck.
*  He was stuck trying to save him.
*  And that should just be better this year.
*  He's my biggest fear for the over that he would just be awesome this season.
*  He could do it. And there's going to be games.
*  But when I when I saw that that Embiid's definitely not playing back to backs and it
*  seems like Paul George is going to be careful, too, and all their rhetoric about
*  we're all about the playoffs, we're all about the title.
*  To me, that's that ties into the over under.
*  I don't think I don't think they care what spot they're going to be in the playoffs
*  seeds. I don't think they're going to be chasing the division.
*  And I just think they want to get to the playoffs with these guys healthy, which makes
*  it an under for me.
*  I will say this, though. I do think this is kind of a make or break season for Darrell's
*  career. Darrell's been running teams now for almost two decades, right?
*  This is arguably his best chance he's ever going to have.
*  Paul George every year from now on is going to be each year will be four or five
*  percent worse because he's in his mid late 30s.
*  I don't I don't I don't have any I think.
*  OK, so he hasn't won it.
*  But I'm saying this is his best chance.
*  Yeah, this is the Warriors in his way.
*  Right. He's in the East.
*  You basically have to hope the Celtics and Knicks basically play each other.
*  I don't I don't think you want to play both of them.
*  Maybe luck out and they end up, you know, in the one force and play like that.
*  But I don't think they're going to have a better chance on paper.
*  But I just don't know if I believe in this team on paper.
*  So I'm going under. Also, one other Paul George question.
*  It would make me nervous why the Quippers didn't pay him.
*  If I was a Philly fan.
*  I don't think it matters.
*  It was the fourth year.
*  You had cap space.
*  Exactly.
*  So what's wrong with that?
*  Ballmer cares now about the future four years from now.
*  I would agree with that.
*  But you know who never cares about the back end of a contract is Darryl.
*  That's a fact.
*  I'm just talking about what what did the Quippers know?
*  Because I think they're the ones that are dealing with a player day in and day out for six years.
*  So they were just like, whoa, four years.
*  That's too rich for our blood.
*  That's crazy.
*  They just gave Kawhi Leonard an extension.
*  No, you're right.
*  Even play. But it was Paul George was the deal breaker.
*  This or what for the Sixers.
*  It wasn't like they had their pick of five or six.
*  I'm not arguing with the Sixers part.
*  I would just be nervous that the Quippers were like, yeah, all right, good luck, man.
*  I think you're nervous already.
*  Yeah.
*  And you had no choice.
*  Here's your fourth year.
*  We're nervous as hell.
*  Thank you.
*  Are you under or over?
*  Under.
*  And house is slight over.
*  I feel like it's a 50 and a half.
*  The bottom line is there's a lot of 50 win teams in the league this year.
*  OK, the Toronto Raptors.
*  Let's go.
*  Rossello had them in the worst season tickets draft over under 29 and a half.
*  They were 25 and 57 last year.
*  Just it's a blanket under for me.
*  What do you got, Rossello?
*  Heavy under.
*  The heaviest.
*  That's a lock.
*  Wow.
*  Oh, this is.
*  Are we doing worse rosters?
*  Or we could do that right now if you want.
*  OK, look, Washington's terrible.
*  But at least with Mike Winger and the people there, there's a plan and they're really smart.
*  And he has a really good track record.
*  So, you know, we all know what's going on there.
*  It's just that SAR, I don't know how exciting that's going to be the first year.
*  Alex SAR.
*  I think not exciting.
*  I can tell you that house is not excited.
*  Not excited.
*  All right.
*  There you go.
*  That's season ticket holder.
*  Unexcited.
*  Definitely not a season ticket holder.
*  Not not yet.
*  Under any circumstances.
*  Season tickets available, House.
*  Everything's available.
*  10 game pass.
*  There's nothing not available.
*  How about you get you in the 300s for a six pack, a homer?
*  A massage.
*  They offered me a massage during the game.
*  All right.
*  So, look, Chicago's been mentioned.
*  Portland's been mentioned.
*  I don't, you know, I think that's a little disrespectful.
*  You know, there's some Charlotte stuff you go through there too deep going, is this that much fun?
*  Let me offer to you Toronto and what they're spending on this group.
*  Because once we looked at the numbers after the off season, everything had settled down.
*  So this team went 25 and 57.
*  They traded four quickly and R.J.
*  Barrett, where I'll go on record saying, like, I think OG and some of the shooting numbers are a little inflated because they're specific where I thought R.J.
*  Barrett had a little bit more flow to the game and like getting into his offense.
*  So I think he's actually like a little bit more talent offensive player.
*  The metrics on it.
*  Tell me I'm an idiot.
*  Okay, fine, fine.
*  Quickly, you knew as soon as you signed him, you're going to be like, I really like him.
*  Now I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  They're spending eighty one and a half million dollars this year on quickly R.J.
*  Barrett and Bruce Brown.
*  That's eighty one million dollars on those three guys.
*  And remember that Brown contract is this weird thing that floated around because Denver couldn't match it.
*  Next year, next year with the new extension for Barnes.
*  Well, I like Barnes.
*  So at least Barnes gives you more hope than say anyone in some of these other bad rosters.
*  You're paying Barnes quickly and R.J.
*  Barrett a hundred and nine million.
*  And if you want to throw in Jakob Pertl's 20 million, that's a hundred and twenty nine million in two years for Barnes quickly.
*  R.J.
*  Barrett and Jakob fucking Pertl, who I like.
*  I like Jakob Pertl.
*  They gave him an eighty million dollar extension because they traded for him.
*  I think they added a linic because they gave up a pick for Pertl.
*  Right.
*  But they're they're bad and kind of expensive.
*  Yeah, I don't understand.
*  The rarest of rare.
*  Yeah.
*  The Pistons hit this a couple of years ago.
*  Yeah, when they had Blake.
*  The quickly contract is exactly the type of contract I would just never give out if I was a GM.
*  It's in that Jordan pool hero.
*  You're paying between 30 and 40 million for a guy who.
*  Is it time for an investor call on Masai Yusiri?
*  Oh, man.
*  Is it time?
*  I don't know if I had any Masai stock.
*  Masai won the title.
*  He won the title.
*  We are officially five years outside the one the title window.
*  Well, he's definitely outside it.
*  I think the Raptor fans are kind of wondering what's going on with this team.
*  I can't believe what you're right.
*  House anyway, answer your own question.
*  I'm just asking.
*  Here's the trade of OG is fine.
*  Why would you bring back those two guys?
*  What is your goal?
*  What are you imagining you're going to do with this team?
*  How is the how are those two guys competing against who you're competing against for that quickly money?
*  Right.
*  Was somebody else sitting there like the Russians?
*  Another league.
*  Is there another league?
*  Yeah.
*  Is there a live basketball tournament that we don't know about?
*  I don't.
*  What's weird is that for all the money they spent, I still don't like.
*  How all these guys mesh together.
*  You know, it doesn't.
*  Who else doesn't?
*  Darko, their head coach, because they couldn't figure it the fuck out.
*  Right.
*  And they've got Grady Dick running around and then Jacoby Walter, who was one of my least favorite guys in the draft.
*  And we'll see.
*  You know, I don't know.
*  I've been wrong before.
*  A Baji found his way over there a little bit.
*  It's a very like when I started adding up your core pieces, you're going to pay Scotty Barnes too much in the rookie extension.
*  Fine.
*  I just got to do it.
*  He's better than again, some of these other rosters are going through.
*  They'd kill to have Scotty Barnes.
*  We're all on the same page there.
*  But when I added it up, I went that's eight.
*  When you're nine figures deep and that's the group.
*  I had in my notes.
*  What's the point of this team before you did it?
*  Oh, you know, I've just that was you did your rant.
*  But I couple knowers of ball.
*  I was just like, I did some ranting too.
*  I was just like, I don't understand the point of all these players together.
*  And if Grady Dick is bad, then who knows?
*  But he's kind of the only I don't think he's bad.
*  I'm saying if he's not good for what the how they're leaning on him this year, this team could be really bad.
*  I have a special little segment for Vasilis.
*  I did not give him a heads up for.
*  Then he doesn't need prep.
*  This is this is going to be the Rossello genius at work.
*  Worst crunch time go to plays.
*  Where does the Scotty Barnes ISO rank with some of the others?
*  I wrote down four for some thought starters, but I don't even know if you need the thought starters.
*  Worst ISO plays down to 48 seconds left coming out of a timeout.
*  And you're like, this is going to be fucking dog shit.
*  I can't wait to watch this.
*  So what do you got?
*  I would say Lamello in something.
*  The high screen and roll stop.
*  Look down, wave at kids, court side.
*  OK, that's not one of my favorites, although we only played 22 games last year.
*  Can you top the pool Kuzma high screen?
*  No, pool has to be on the floor at the end of the game.
*  I think Cam Thomas, not knowing the other four guys checked in after the timeout, is another one.
*  We have teammates. We haven't even done those guys.
*  I can't wait to share my Cam Thomas number with you guys.
*  What about would you go scoot Aitin pick and roll?
*  I like that.
*  Aitin stretches the floor, scoots dynamic off the dribble.
*  The Tatum step back three at the end of the end of the quarter.
*  I'm glad you included that.
*  The elbow everyone.
*  Yeah, that one sucks.
*  I don't know what the stats are, but they're awful.
*  Remember the ones against Atlanta when they blew both of those games?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, that week.
*  Are there any other ones?
*  I don't know. I guess we could go.
*  There were some Jalen Green ones a couple of years ago.
*  I was like, hey, I was the top pick.
*  Everybody just get out of the way plays.
*  Under for me, under for Rosillo as a lock, under for Joe House.
*  Yeah, under under.
*  I mean, I got to say, I'm a little confused why this.
*  Over under was so high, the 29 and a half.
*  Maybe they thought Nick Nurse was still there, but that just I would have
*  when I was doing these, I would have guessed like 24 and a half, 25 and a half
*  for them. Think about it.
*  They went 25 in 57 with the Sea Ockham portion.
*  Right. Yeah. Like this is a lock for me.
*  So and they also didn't have a first round pick.
*  Not that maybe this dropped them out.
*  All right. Last team in this division, the Brooklyn Nets.
*  House and I scouted them last night against the Wizards on one of the TVs.
*  There over under is an astonishing 18 and a half.
*  And they have their own first round pick, which they traded back for.
*  Starting lineup.
*  I mean, they have a lot of professional basketball players.
*  House, you want to go through it?
*  I'm here. We watched it last night.
*  Clack, Claxton, Smith, Cam Johnson, Rosillo's favorite, Cam Thomas,
*  Dennis Schroeder, Olympic hero, rejuvenated Ben Simmons, Bogdanovich is on this team.
*  Sharp, Clowney.
*  It's a professional basketball team.
*  Jillian Hayes.
*  I thought 18 and a half is too low and I'm actually leaning over
*  unless you guys can talk me out of it.
*  I'm not going to talk you out of it.
*  I'm already over and I didn't even really hesitate.
*  This didn't feel hard to me.
*  If their intention and it's pretty express is to
*  harvest these bodies and then trade them for assets
*  and be in position to get Mr.
*  Cooper flag, then the way to do that is to play these guys and let them get some minutes.
*  And if these guys play, they're going to win some basketball games
*  because they're better than some of the rosters that we've looked at and talked about.
*  By the way, 32 and 50 last year.
*  Yeah, 19 wins.
*  It's a pretty big drop off.
*  It's such a low ceiling.
*  It's an over for me.
*  We were impressed last night because they actually have a bunch of guys,
*  whether you like them or not, who know where to move on a basketball court and offense.
*  For the most part.
*  For the most part. Like Simmons, I have no idea how many games he's going to play,
*  but he looked genuinely good last night.
*  If they try and make him a trade asset.
*  Yeah, anything, even the even a second.
*  Right. What do you got for yourself?
*  I can't wait for the next Simmons contract and next team.
*  Just excited about it.
*  Could be San Antonio.
*  I like Cam Johnson and Germany.
*  Schroeder is a whole different animal there.
*  And what if he just becomes Germany Schroeder?
*  Has he thought about it?
*  He needs to go to Orlando for that.
*  Smith, Clowney, another year of seasoning, Claxton.
*  It's kind of like Sharp, a little bit out of the trap.
*  Here's a here's a number for you.
*  Here's where all your overs go to die.
*  This is going to be Cam Thomas.
*  He should be a first round pick in fantasy.
*  How many field goal attempts will he take?
*  Well, let's take a look at the per one hundred.
*  They're not just field goal attempts.
*  Better sense of when you're out there, how often are you letting it fly?
*  Cam Thomas averages twenty eight field goal attempts per one hundred.
*  That's fourth in the NBA
*  with other notable role players, Jaylen Brunson,
*  Luca Donchich and Steph Curry.
*  This is why he's 50 to one on Fando for points per game scoring title.
*  It's not a bad bet with that value, because I think they know like they have to tank.
*  They can't screw around.
*  They've got to worry about the Wizards.
*  Eighteen and a half is such a low number, but I think the 30 and two,
*  the 32 and 50 last season is irrelevant.
*  There's a couple of vibe killers on this team.
*  Give me the under. OK.
*  On Cam Thomas, because I don't feel like you went far enough.
*  Cam Thomas, he scored twenty seven a game in the last two months of the season
*  on 400 shots a game.
*  But I was thinking about the good stats, bad team Hall of Fame.
*  And actually went through and just spent way too much time on this.
*  And I'm going to give you my starters and a four man bench.
*  Pete Maravich, 1977, 31 points a game.
*  People longs on these teams because Pete's Pete was a good stats, bad team guy
*  for his entire career.
*  Bradley Beale, your favorite, 20, 21, 31.3 points a game.
*  World be free 1980, San Diego Clippers, 30.2 points a game.
*  All these guys I picked had losing records.
*  Kevin Welles, 1991, 15.4 rebounds a game.
*  Remember when he was just trying to win the rebound title and like everything else be
*  damp. Sven Nader, same thing, 1980, 15.1 points a game.
*  And then the bench.
*  You bring up Sven Nader a lot. I don't know anything about him.
*  Sven Nader, 15 a game.
*  Manute Bull, 1986, Bullets.
*  What do you do? Five blocks a game in 26 minutes.
*  I'm throwing them on there. I needed a rim protection.
*  You can't put Manute and not Mark Eaton.
*  What I mean, Mark Eaton's team won a game.
*  Yeah, they won. All right.
*  Jerry Stackhouse, 2001, 29.8 points a game on 24 shots a game.
*  And then Freeman Williams, my third 1980 San Diego Clipper, the all time good stats, bad team guy.
*  Jelly Bean Joe Brian was on there as well.
*  18.6 points a game in 25.8 minutes.
*  And then my favorite, John Drew, 1983 Jazz, 21.2 points a game in 27.4 minutes.
*  It was fucking going up when he was in the game.
*  Anyway, I think Cam Thomas has a chance to world be free at this.
*  I think it could be legendary, and I think that's by design.
*  So nobody's but then I think it's going to piss off other guys.
*  I think Bridges literally stopped caring.
*  It was so bad during the season.
*  That's just an observation. No one told.
*  More popular, the Liberty or the Nets right now?
*  It's got to be the Liberty.
*  I think it is.
*  They got next.
*  It's happening. All right.
*  The Southeast is our last division.
*  We always end in the Southeast.
*  Always. Who's your turquoise guy going?
*  Orlando Magic starting us off 47 and a half.
*  Last year, we were super bullish on the Orlando Magic.
*  We went all in. We all had the over.
*  It won easily.
*  They were 47 and 35.
*  They lost Markel Faltz.
*  Tough one for Saruti.
*  He's still on sign.
*  Well, he's he's having knee issues.
*  Yeah, well, just, you know, they added KCP.
*  Yeah.
*  They are minus 145 for the division.
*  17-1 for the conference.
*  16 to 1 for the one seed.
*  So OKC goes from 24 wins to 40 to 55 last three years.
*  Orlando goes 22 to 34 to 47.
*  What's the limit this year in your head for wins?
*  50. I think this could be a 50-win team.
*  50 to 53?
*  Sure. I mean, fine.
*  You know, low fifties.
*  It's an over for me at 47 and a half.
*  I like that number.
*  Forty seven games last year.
*  The offense was the lowest of any playoff team at 22 in the league.
*  You got it, House?
*  I mean, those are all my notes.
*  No, I don't. I'm not going to go through them all.
*  I'm we're 100 percent lockstep.
*  Twenty seventh and three point frequency, 25th and three point accuracy.
*  Will Franz fucking Wagner Wagner make a fucking three when it matters?
*  When? Give me the Franz Wagner.
*  I can't. I can't imagine he's going to be this bad.
*  He's just going to be bad from three now.
*  What happened, though?
*  Because for sure, the team got better last year.
*  The team was better and the stakes were higher.
*  And he sucked.
*  I think it was a good learning experience for him.
*  I'm not scared off, but there's been a lot of good players that
*  had a shitty playoff.
*  I thought he was pretty good in the Olympics.
*  It wasn't just the playoffs.
*  He was a bad three point shooter last year.
*  I get it.
*  I'm going over as well.
*  And I'm putting a lock on that one.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  Oh, locking it up. I am.
*  This is where you guys are going to beat me because I'm taking there under.
*  I think they're going to go 47 and 35 again.
*  You've really got it mapped out to the half game.
*  Well, I just.
*  Your model.
*  So here's the thing.
*  I don't know why they wouldn't be better, because I think Franz will be better.
*  Paolo might actually be better in like, oh, my God, he's one of the best.
*  Eleven players in the league.
*  That's the answer for why I'm KCP was was one of the two things they needed.
*  They still need the other thing, which is they need somebody who can
*  give that like I thought Malik Monk would have been perfect for them.
*  But somebody like that that can come off the bench and create offense for them.
*  But Isaac's going to be playing.
*  They brought him back.
*  I think they have different looks.
*  They basically just resigned all their own guys.
*  They did. They had a KCP.
*  They continuity in a good way and good.
*  And then the question for me is, yeah, I think the question for me is,
*  can they can they get anything out of Anthony Black?
*  Yeah, why not? I mean, why would they give them 20 minutes?
*  I want somebody to help me understand Franz Wagner.
*  That's the thing. I'm worried he was not good in the Olympics.
*  I don't. His brother was very good in the Olympics.
*  His brother was still on this team. I know.
*  Sadly, to everyone should agree, Gary Harris is back on the team.
*  I was really hoping this would be it for our long national neighbor.
*  They can't shake him off. Gary Harris.
*  They just can't quit Gary Harris.
*  But this is a strong, strong over for me.
*  17 to 1 for the conference, I thought was interesting, too, because.
*  Did you watch that series against Cleveland last year?
*  I'm just saying. I'm a you know me better than anybody.
*  I wonder, is there trade for them? I lost money on them
*  because they couldn't score the basketball and show me how that's going to change.
*  Here's what needs to change, though. Here's what needs to change.
*  Yeah, I'm listening.
*  So I think that Paolo is a really good example of watching
*  and the difference between the analytic approach to him,
*  because there was some stuff that would tell you he's overrated.
*  He's not super efficient.
*  And I would counter with when you watch them, the number of games,
*  especially when it started to really like become a thing end of the year,
*  end of January, the Denver game, he's hit all these huge shots.
*  And you're like, this is happening.
*  Like, this is really happening.
*  I'm doing the monologue on this guy tomorrow.
*  But he was bailing them out of so many awful possessions
*  because they didn't have the traditional point guard part of it.
*  And if you look at shot quality and there's variation for however you want to look at it.
*  But like, OK, who has the most possessions in the NBA?
*  Well, Luca had the most possessions last year.
*  Where did he rank on like shot quality points per possession?
*  Well, because he's so good and everything was on him, he was in the forty first percentile.
*  Right. Not very good at the high end shocker Jokic, because he won't take bad shots.
*  He just won't. He was in the 92nd percentile.
*  Paolo was in the 20th percentile on shot quality, according to the data that I have,
*  which again, there could be a number that goes a little bit.
*  It's pretty glaring that he got stuck taking so many bad shots
*  because everything was on him, which I think is the explanation of dragging down that efficiency
*  and the arguments that I've seen that maybe he's not really as good.
*  I think he is so special and the burden that he had.
*  And again, it comes down to watching it.
*  Like, why is he inefficient?
*  Is he inefficient or is he in inefficient situations?
*  And so I think he's like a really good study of last year of the difference
*  between just what the numbers tell you and then why those numbers exist in the first place.
*  All right. Situation.
*  We're allowed to switch. Yeah, you're allowed to switch.
*  I'm going over because you reminded me as you were making the good,
*  compelling case about Paolo that I bet him to win the MVP of this league at plus 153,
*  at 153 to one odds.
*  I like it's fucking.
*  I mean, he has the talent to do it someday.
*  There's no question. But yeah, it's not going to be this season.
*  No. But that number was just like, I think what you say about situation
*  with stats is such a good point, because I was thinking about that a lot.
*  I talked about it on my podcast with Drake May and Berset.
*  Where you're like, you can't play Drake May because the Pats can't block anyone.
*  The quarterback's under siege. And it's like, well,
*  part of the reason they're under siege is because everyone who plays them knows
*  that Berset can't throw the ball more than seven yards.
*  So the defense is just all the way up.
*  And yeah, of course, they're under siege.
*  And then when Drake May, you could see in the second half,
*  their offensive line still can't block that well.
*  But the field opened up and things opened up and all of a sudden guys were open
*  because they couldn't play up like they did because he could throw it over their heads.
*  And the Palo thing, there were so many times last year
*  where six seconds left in the shot clock and they would throw it to him
*  and be like, OK, I, you know, he had those or you had the whole defense shaded to his side.
*  The 6'10 guy dribbling from the elbow left to right.
*  And then, you know, this kind of fit.
*  You're looking to go on that shot's not that great.
*  But the reason I brought up Anthony Black was they so desperately needed that point
*  guard something, some sort of somebody.
*  He can't be initiating literally everything.
*  And you're right.
*  Like you hope it's more Suggs or more Anthony Black.
*  I totally agree.
*  Miami Heat.
*  So we're all over on Orlando.
*  Miami Heat, 43 and a half plus 175 for the division plus 240 to miss the playoffs,
*  minus 125 for the play in.
*  They're basically running it back.
*  They made their big trade last February and it seems like they're kind of standing pat
*  waiting to see how it happened, where what how this plays out.
*  Rossello, you buckled up for the Jimmy Butler revenge door.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Because there's some Kaiser Soze shit brewing right now.
*  And I don't know if people are focused on it.
*  I love that Pat Riley just called him out and it fucking worked.
*  It pissed him off.
*  He didn't even do like the stupid hair at Media Day thing.
*  He's fucking pissed.
*  How many other guys can play?
*  You don't think I can play more than 60 games, motherfucker?
*  Like, he's mad and mad Jimmy Butler.
*  I'm in the Butler story.
*  In general, it's just kind of fascinating because this Miami deal with the 20 finals
*  and what he did a couple of years ago and getting this team.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, I don't know that anybody's ever been rewarded more for not winning a title.
*  And that and again, they should be with the Hall of Famer now.
*  He didn't win the title, but he's certainly a player that we're going to remember from
*  whatever this generation was.
*  Right.
*  But I mean, we've already covered this, but they didn't give him the extension because
*  and then Riley called him out.
*  Riley is at the old man in his 80s stage where he just gives no fucks anymore.
*  He's like, fuck this.
*  You weren't available to us enough last year.
*  Like, we didn't like how the season went.
*  We're not giving you the max extension.
*  Prove it to us that you deserve one.
*  And I think Jimmy Butler is like, okay.
*  And they still probably won't do it.
*  I'd like to see the full Rozier experience with these guys and another year at Yo-Hitch.
*  Yo-Hitch is probably one of my favorite.
*  Like, could this happen?
*  It's some Olympic stuff with them too.
*  Yeah.
*  I really liked him before the draft.
*  So I'm a little more invested.
*  Year two of Hawkeyes, they signed out with Berks.
*  And then everybody liked where the draft pick is.
*  As soon as you watch them play in the summer, you go, oh, that'll make a lot of sense for them.
*  Like it fits a real need to kind of balance out what BAM gives you.
*  Look, it's an over just because of Spoke.
*  Same boat, a hundred percent, exact same boat.
*  Not fading Miami, not fading Spoke.
*  Just not going to do it.
*  I went into...
*  How'd they win 46 games last year?
*  Exactly.
*  I went into the preseason, like this is the year it all falls apart for Miami.
*  It's going to be a disaster.
*  Jimmy Butler's checked every box for me.
*  I'm all in.
*  I think he's going to be really good, at least for the first two months.
*  Whether he can stay healthy, he's 35 years old.
*  We'll see.
*  But I think he's going to have a huge chip on his shoulder this year.
*  So we're all in on Miami.
*  Plus by the way, they still have a trade to make.
*  That's it.
*  That's the reason why.
*  If January, February range, there's moves that they could make.
*  They're always willing to try and get better.
*  44 is a low bar for them, it feels like to me.
*  Well, we're about to do the most fun team that we could possibly do.
*  The Atlanta Hawks.
*  The team that really messed up what would have been an incredible run for us last
*  year, which was still really great.
*  They really screwed us.
*  None of they screw us, but they had one of the worst records against the spread in
*  the history of the NBA, I think, for as long as they've been tracking it.
*  Just a massive disappointment.
*  Every time it felt like it was going to get better.
*  It didn't.
*  They finally trade DeJante Murray.
*  Their over under has dropped down to 36 and a half.
*  They had the number of pick in the draft.
*  They took Risa Shea.
*  Controversial pick.
*  They traded Murray for a Dyson Daniels and Larry Nance and some picks.
*  I'm going to hold my thoughts.
*  Rossella, you start us off because I know what house thinks.
*  Every year I pick the over because I'm like, you know, this team's actually pretty
*  talented, even though trade is not my favorite, the DeJante thing backfired.
*  They still owe all the picks.
*  So they have to stay competitive, even though they got super lucky with Risa
*  Shea, potentially in the worst year to get that lucky.
*  Fuck it under.
*  Under I'm stunned.
*  I'm so sick of it.
*  You know, I really like DeAndre Hunter can just get a couple of steady months.
*  You know, Buffkin is interesting.
*  I'm thrilled about Dyson Daniels.
*  Look, I every year I pick over.
*  I talk about their talent.
*  You know, it feels like a spite under.
*  It's a hundred percent.
*  It's a spite. Great read.
*  It really resonates with me.
*  House. You guys are going over.
*  You do any of the end.
*  I'm going super over.
*  I'm going way over with I'm going over with lock next to it.
*  Okay.
*  Thirty six and a half.
*  Sign me up.
*  Here's the biggest thing.
*  Dominic Barlow.
*  They have their first round pick.
*  St. Antonio has it.
*  There's literally no incentive for them to say they're going to take.
*  But like we just did it a year ago.
*  You're right.
*  I'm chasing it.
*  I'm chasing it a year later.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to go.
*  I'm going to go here.
*  Okay.
*  Kind of like the team.
*  We watched it last night.
*  We were like, Jesus Christ, seven six foot nine athletic guys who can shoot threes of this team.
*  What's happening?
*  Well, they'll suck on defense again.
*  Yeah, I don't see.
*  So we were watching Reese's Shay closely last night.
*  I think he's going to play and I think he's going to be good.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd be the first person I've heard say that.
*  How about this?
*  I'm looking for places on Reese's Shay Island.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, you're in a lot of it's a lot of undeveloped land.
*  I think you can have any place.
*  We watched this play.
*  There was this play in this in the second half.
*  And I watched it and the house was barely paid attention.
*  I rewound it.
*  I was like, how?
*  So watch this.
*  He was he was defending somebody at the top of the key, like 35 feet away.
*  Guy made a drive to the right.
*  He stuck with him the whole way.
*  Forced to kick out.
*  Sounds incredible.
*  Misplay.
*  Moving the other way.
*  Reese's Shay busts his ass down so he can get a layup.
*  And I was just like, this guy gets it.
*  I'm in.
*  This guy plays defense.
*  He runs the floor.
*  He can shoot threes and you know, it's hard.
*  I'm so bad at picking foreign guys, but.
*  But that you just articulated the scouting report, right?
*  He played in.
*  He was the Euro Cup rising star.
*  He looked like an adult is my point.
*  I was like, this guy looks like he's 25.
*  He played in the competitive league and he always had the other team's toughest wing in that league.
*  I hope so.
*  And then you throw in Daniels who you've liked for three fucking years.
*  Yeah, I like Daniels.
*  So maybe they will be better on defense because they have him and they have Larry Nansen.
*  We haven't even mentioned Jalen Johnson.
*  There you go.
*  Jalen Johnson.
*  Finally.
*  Jalen Johnson bump is the reason for the over.
*  That's it.
*  You know what?
*  I.
*  No, I'm not.
*  Come on.
*  Oh, come join us.
*  You can flip.
*  I flipped on.
*  I flipped on.
*  I know I can.
*  Come.
*  Come get.
*  I don't want to.
*  I'm going to wear.
*  I don't want to mention Bogdanovich.
*  I'm going to eat lemon pepper wings.
*  Bogdanovich, Trey Young.
*  He's still not satisfied.
*  Dejante is not here.
*  Now I can cook.
*  I think Dejante.
*  Have you seen Capella is huge.
*  I don't want him huge.
*  15 pounds of muscle.
*  He's doing the opposite of Tim Duncan slash Joelle.
*  You know, I'll say I have your guy, Larry Nance.
*  I love Larry Nance.
*  Kind of like Buffkin.
*  I like this team.
*  I'm back in.
*  What do you think they're going to do?
*  Nine seed?
*  I just think they're high 30s.
*  Thirty six and a half.
*  High 30s.
*  High 30s.
*  That's all we need, boys.
*  It's the play in Hawks.
*  No, they have.
*  That's their identity.
*  I've done this for like three years.
*  Not doing it this year.
*  They don't have their pick this year.
*  They have a Sacramento protected first.
*  Spurs swap in 26.
*  They have either Milwaukee or New Orleans is picking 27 worst one.
*  And then they own all their own first.
*  28, 29, 30.
*  So they're actually incentivized to give a shit.
*  I just like their team.
*  I just like the makeup of just a bunch of long guys who can shoot.
*  People staring at me sarcastically.
*  Rebounders and rim protection.
*  Yeah, no.
*  Bogdanovich is a heat check guy.
*  Sure.
*  And the East sucks.
*  They can't wait to make six terrible teams.
*  They're dying.
*  They're going to win 39.
*  You guys might be right.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  I don't have to.
*  We tried.
*  Charlotte Hornets over under 30 and a half.
*  This is a lock under.
*  Great.
*  I'm right there to join you.
*  I didn't even wait.
*  Sorry.
*  No, I couldn't believe the number.
*  I couldn't believe the number.
*  They were 21 and 61 last year.
*  They were actually above expected.
*  Their offense is terrible.
*  Their defense was worse.
*  They can't shoot.
*  Maybe the meatchich minutes were exciting for people.
*  Lanzo's back.
*  Excuse me.
*  Lamelo is back who has one of the most incredible stat profiles of any guy you're going to run
*  across.
*  He's played 184 of 328 games in four years.
*  He had like a top 10 usage rate in the games he played, but he also had like a minus 12 net rating.
*  So for all the guys are like the highest usage.
*  They're the best players in the league.
*  So they're generally like the net rating is pretty good.
*  And with him, it was off the charts.
*  Terrible.
*  He's I would say he's the stat head MVP.
*  You know that thing in basketball?
*  There's other things you can look up where it's like only seven guys ever have averaged
*  22, six and six for the first four years.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, that means one had that because they'll shoot out Lanzo ball.
*  Were you looking for a condo in St. Pete?
*  Are you looking for the ball state water polo team?
*  You know, you could talk yourself into the Brandon Miller part of it.
*  Let's see what happens with Mark Williams health.
*  And then, you know, no one would have suggested that Miles Bridges extension at that number
*  made sense, but they felt like they were in a spot where they had to protect the asset.
*  I, you know, I it's a lot of money.
*  Josh Green comeback.
*  Yeah.
*  I look, I don't, I read something about like Josh Green, like, oh, he flamed out and out.
*  I always kind of like the Josh Green.
*  Yeah, you're fine.
*  Hustler great energy through that.
*  So I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  through that.
*  So, you know, whatever, I'm going to stop talking now, but it's under.
*  You didn't talk about Grant Williams.
*  Bench, Grant Williams, plug and play.
*  Better and later.
*  Yeah.
*  House.
*  The only case to go over is it's two parts.
*  It's it's LaMelo ball plays 65 games and Charles Lee is a magician.
*  Charles Lee, there's all, there's a lot of Charles Lee love out there.
*  Beloved Charles Lee coming together and an enormous improvement over Steve
*  Clifford and then he's going to put all these guys, they're all going to buy in.
*  I'm not going to buy in.
*  I've already stayed in my position on the under, but that's the case for the over.
*  It's LaMelo ball playing, you know, tray man to the game unleashed, perhaps
*  zero playoff games the last eight years.
*  Can LaMelo be the best guy in a playoff team?
*  No, no.
*  No, he's funny how like the Mellow thing has now kind of come full circle where I didn't like him
*  for the draft and then some teams are working them out with like, dude, he's so big and the way he
*  sees the court.
*  And then when you watch him in the beginning, you're like his handle and the shooting numbers
*  and all of this stuff.
*  And I kind of think he's like, he's this, he's like a creative player, video game guy that
*  your kids fucking love.
*  Totally agree with.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you look at the other stuff, you're like, yeah, they stink all the time.
*  They are 124 and 194 in the LaMelo era.
*  I thought-
*  He misses a lot of time, like way more than I realized.
*  I thought long and hard about the over and here's why.
*  You mentioned Charles Lee.
*  The Celtics love that dude.
*  I know.
*  Like that guy, they thought that guy was amazing and everyone in Milwaukee loved him too.
*  And I actually think he's going to be a really good coach.
*  Sure.
*  But it feels like their organization in general, like the heritage GM that everybody respects,
*  they have like a new ownership group.
*  They do.
*  Taking their time.
*  They're not doing that.
*  We bought a team.
*  They even let everybody stay, I think for a year from the previous regime.
*  Right.
*  They've just handled their business correctly.
*  So kind of rooting for the over, but I don't see the talent.
*  I don't know if people like, I don't know if all the stuff will ever come out, but Jordan
*  may have been one of the worst like owner into the front office guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I think there's just so much respect for him.
*  It was like, ah, let's not even like do one of these stories, but just terrible, terrible at it.
*  Abe Polanew.
*  That's why.
*  Yeah, Abe got out.
*  Abe Polanew.
*  I really wanted to go over.
*  I don't think they're going to get anything from their first round pick this year, which made me nervous.
*  And then even though I think people saloon, I think people like the pick, but he's,
*  I don't see him playing like 35 minutes a game.
*  Please once every couple of weeks, it should be like, go out there and just go nuts.
*  He's watch him.
*  The first time he goes to box out a guy at an NBA game, the other guys, if it's an older player
*  who's been around with some resume, he's going to get so pissed off at him.
*  I was watching him box out.
*  I would rewind the clips watching him box out against guys.
*  He plays every possession.
*  Like it's the last time he's ever going to be allowed to play basketball.
*  So I kind of loved him, but I also am afraid he might not be good.
*  Well, here's the problem with all of us going under on Charlotte.
*  So if you look at the playing tournament, let's just say, let's say the top six in the East are
*  Boston, Cleveland, New York, Orlando, Milwaukee, Philly in some order, right?
*  Those six.
*  I think that's fair.
*  And then Indiana as the seventh, but maybe they move up.
*  Somebody bounced down.
*  There's basically a top seven.
*  And then you have Miami and Atlanta.
*  I think we would say are in the eight, nine spots probably, but we still need a 10th playing team.
*  And the options are Charlotte, Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, Brooklyn, or Washington.
*  And from what we just did, we think all of those teams are going to be under 30 wins.
*  So we might have a plan team that goes like 29 and 53.
*  Didn't I go over on Chicago?
*  Maybe you did.
*  But, but my point is we've never had, we'll probably never be in a worse plan situation.
*  Than this.
*  They should probably just say this.
*  The, the seven seed just gets to advance and let's have the eight, nine for the, for the eight seed.
*  All right.
*  If they announced before the season started that Brandon Miller was going to be the focal
*  point of the team and they were going to build him up and that was going to be the way over the mellow.
*  I would, I would bet on them.
*  I would bet on, on Charlotte.
*  I like what they're doing.
*  I like that they put shooters around the mellow.
*  I think there's a plan.
*  I think the coach is good.
*  Everyone likes the GM and there's something here.
*  Are you still sticking with the under?
*  I'm sticking under.
*  I mean, the big news.
*  Also, the mellow plays what?
*  50 games a year.
*  They convinced him to wear ankle braces on both his ankles.
*  That's the big mellow news coming out.
*  All right.
*  Last but not least, the Washington Wizards.
*  Always finishing the podcast.
*  This is a tradition unlike any other, the Wizards being the last team.
*  They're over under this year's 20 and a half.
*  Is that a new low house?
*  They've been that low?
*  What were they last year?
*  23 and a half, 24 and a half.
*  20 and a half is low.
*  20 and a half is low.
*  They're 18 to 1 to make the playoffs.
*  Last year, they're 15 and 67.
*  It should be 180,000 to 1 to make the playoffs.
*  They lost Avdia, who I thought was their most reliable player,
*  and replaced them with Malcolm Brogdon and Bub Carrington.
*  Anybody else?
*  I'm leaving out.
*  Carrington, they drafted.
*  They drafted George.
*  They drafted Carrington.
*  They had a good draft.
*  And Alex Sarr.
*  No, I'm saying, right.
*  In a historically bad draft.
*  Big high school profile.
*  They got it.
*  And they added Jonas Balanchunas.
*  So the starting five, I'm guessing, is Jonas,
*  who will be traded in February.
*  Alex Sarr.
*  Kuz, Kyle Kuzma.
*  Who will be traded whenever.
*  Malcolm Brogdon and Jordan Poole.
*  Rossella, will Brogdon open up Jordan Poole's game?
*  I think Brogdon's hurt.
*  He's already hurt.
*  So I think it's Kula Bali.
*  He's already hurt?
*  OK.
*  He's already hurt.
*  Kula Bali.
*  Johnny Davis is fifth on the depth chart.
*  I'd be trying to trade for Kisper if I was on another team.
*  He can absolutely help somebody.
*  Kisper's good.
*  I'm going to do whatever you want to do on this.
*  Fucking hot.
*  I was leaning toward under lock for the Wizards.
*  Oh, let's just do it.
*  What is there to talk about?
*  Like, what goal do they have?
*  Who, what player?
*  I mean, we got the benefit of,
*  we watched them play Brooklyn last night.
*  They lost by, I don't know, 35, 40.
*  Their average losses in the preseason have been around 29 points.
*  It's the worst roster in the league.
*  I even think it's worse than Brooklyn's roster.
*  Are you kidding?
*  This is one of the worst rosters I've ever seen.
*  And I mean, look, it's by design.
*  They traded their three most efficient players,
*  Denny,
*  Tyus,
*  and Gafford.
*  Sounds like a lock for you.
*  Right.
*  So, I mean, I'm a little guilty, but like part of my strategy for this was,
*  I think there's such a massive gap past a certain line of like the seventh team in the East and
*  then the rest of the teams down.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think I was over heavy and under heavy of just the two dueling
*  spectrums of where we're at.
*  And I just don't think Washington's going to screw around when it comes to Cooper flag.
*  I don't think Brooklyn, like, what is the point?
*  So I think there's those three teams where at this number,
*  I thought it was a gift at 20 and a half.
*  I can't believe that they're forecast to have more wins than Brooklyn.
*  That's the thing about it.
*  Yeah.
*  How low would that under have been before you thought about not going under?
*  Because for me, it was probably 15 and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Seriously.
*  15 and a half would have made me go, I can't now.
*  Right.
*  I mean, look, the randomness of if you get the four extra wins that you're not supposed to get,
*  then it screws the whole number up.
*  But you're telling me they're going to win one out of every four games?
*  They don't have the all-dunters yet because I did that with the Pats and the Panthers and NFL.
*  But when they have the all-dunters and it can go to like 16 and a half with like plus 200 on the
*  Wiz, like I'm doing that.
*  It's bangy time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going.
*  Going to do that.
*  So the Wiz, we're all going under.
*  All right.
*  Let me recap what we did and then we're going to do our locks.
*  Last but not least.
*  So we have the Boston Celtics, 58 and a half, me and Rosilla went over, House went under.
*  Knicks, 53 and a half.
*  I went under, House went under, Rosilla went over.
*  Philly, 50 and a half.
*  I went under, Rosilla went under.
*  House went over.
*  It's so wrong.
*  So that number on the Paul George thing dropped again.
*  Again.
*  Yeah.
*  50 and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  Like in the last 24 hours.
*  All right.
*  Toronto, 29 and a half, under, under, under, Rosilla threw a lock on there.
*  Brooklyn Nets, 18 and a half.
*  House and I went over, Rosilla went under.
*  Southeast.
*  That's the Cooper flag in me.
*  It's just, I think there's going to be a couple of teams dueling it out.
*  I just think they have too many pros.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  It'll be one of those in the last two months of the season.
*  We'll see some one in 26 type records.
*  Orlando, 47 and a half, over, over, over.
*  I did a lock on that.
*  Miami.
*  Also locked me up.
*  Okay.
*  Lock up Rosilla.
*  I moved to the over, didn't I?
*  Yes.
*  And then we have the Miami Heat that I thought we were going to be arguing about a little more,
*  but all of us like the over.
*  Heat culture, man.
*  43 and a half.
*  Scares the shit out of all of us a couple years ago.
*  Atlanta, over.
*  Simmons, lock.
*  House, over.
*  Rosilla, under.
*  36 and a half.
*  Charlotte.
*  Spiteful under, you were right.
*  Three unders at 30 and a half for Charlotte and then three unders at 20 and a half for
*  the Washington Wizards.
*  Lock for me.
*  Lock for Rosilla.
*  We locked down the Wizards under last year.
*  It couldn't have hit more easily.
*  Crushed it.
*  House had the over, right?
*  I did.
*  I made an impassioned case for them playing hard for a little bit to showcase the talent
*  and that they weren't incented to just be terrible right from the start.
*  It was way worse than I imagined because I had no idea how bad Jordan Poole is
*  at competitive winning basketball.
*  Honestly, this wasn't as bad as Jordan Poole was.
*  He took it to a whole other level.
*  I'm buying stock, penny stocks.
*  Quickly before we do the final locks.
*  Player bets.
*  Points per game.
*  Luca plus 175.
*  SGA plus 430.
*  Giannis 10 to 1.
*  Ja 48 to 1.
*  Cam Thomas 50 to 1.
*  And he leans.
*  Don't need to have one.
*  I don't think Luca, I wouldn't go Luca because I don't think he cares about it now.
*  33 a game like by accident.
*  And I think he's going to win the MVP.
*  I think he is going to try and win the MVP this year.
*  Okay.
*  There's that's a thing.
*  I don't like any of the scoring.
*  Three pointer Curry is minus 260, which I think is the best bet in sports.
*  Dame is 30 to 1.
*  If you want to go long shot blocks per game, Wemby is minus 480.
*  Just lock that one in.
*  If he plays 55 assists per game, tray young was plus 140 and Halliburton was plus 170.
*  I thought I actually liked the Halliburton odds a little more.
*  LaMelo is 41.
*  If you want to put something out there.
*  Halliburton was the league in this just last year.
*  You know, was fifth was LeBron.
*  Rebounds per game.
*  Subbonus plus 190.
*  Wemby six to one for most rebounds a game.
*  I think you'd have to get to 14.
*  I don't see it.
*  Here's some Wemby odds for you, Rossello.
*  Will he have a quadruple double this year?
*  12 to 1.
*  I love it because it's all year.
*  You get to pretend 12 blocks in a game.
*  Nine to one.
*  I feel like that's I think he gets that.
*  Can you see him blocking 12 blocks in a game?
*  Is that crazy?
*  The only thing that would be against it is that now the awareness of the Wemby U-turn.
*  Yeah.
*  Where guys like the first half of the season.
*  I saw a couple guys.
*  I think there was even an Austin Reeves play where I get to ask him about it after the fact.
*  And he was like, dude, I couldn't believe.
*  And now everybody like guys hate having their shot block.
*  It's so embarrassing that maybe he just won't have enough attempts at it.
*  I don't know.
*  50 point game plus 130.
*  Six triple doubles this year.
*  This was the one that really jumped out to me.
*  14 to 1.
*  For Wemby?
*  Yeah.
*  He only has to have six.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's do this.
*  I thought that was a great one.
*  I agree.
*  Because that's just there'd have to be six games where he has 10 blocks basically.
*  So there you go.
*  All right.
*  And what did you have for a finals pick?
*  OKC over Boston.
*  Good one.
*  I like OKC and the New York Knicks.
*  I have Boston over OKC.
*  Great.
*  I think they repeat and then I don't know what happens to the team after that.
*  Because the tax bill next year is actually ridiculous.
*  It's like maybe calculable.
*  Maybe flip a wing for Sohan.
*  I think they could get him.
*  All right.
*  Last but not least, before all of us PN ourselves, these are the final locks.
*  That have to be that?
*  We only agree on two overs actually.
*  OKC 57 and a half.
*  We're all going over.
*  Lock.
*  Phoenix 47 and a half.
*  We're all going over.
*  Lock.
*  House and I are doing Cleveland 48 and a half over.
*  I'm doing Orlando 47 and a half over.
*  So is Rosillo.
*  Rosillo is doing Toronto under 29 and a half.
*  House and I are doing over Atlanta 36 and a half.
*  I hope it's not just because we watched a dumb game yesterday.
*  I'm doing Washington under 20 and a half.
*  Rosillo is doing under New Orleans 45 and a half.
*  House and I are doing the under for Wembee and San Antonio 35 and a half.
*  Just too high.
*  Too many.
*  Love to Wembee, but that's just too many.
*  And then I'm doing the under for the Quippers 37 and a half.
*  House is doing under Denver 50 and a half.
*  I can't believe you're locking Denver under.
*  And the two of you are both.
*  Are you doing Houston over too?
*  Uh, yeah, 42 and a half.
*  You guys both have the Houston over.
*  I'm just going to enjoy that one from afar.
*  Great.
*  Okay.
*  Well, those are our locks for the 24 or 25 NBA season fellas.
*  That was four and a half hours.
*  It flew by.
*  I had a great time.
*  Thanks to Kyle, Gahal and Sarudy.
*  You can watch all of these videos on the on the Bill Simmons YouTube channel.
