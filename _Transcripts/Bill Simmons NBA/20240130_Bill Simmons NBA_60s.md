# Is it Time for LeBron and the Lakers to Part Ways? #billsimmons #shorts #nba #lebronjames #lakers
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmsaX0aWyBM)
*  Kevin O'Connor wrote about LeBron today and he said LeBron's got to decide can he stay
*  with the Lakers or should maybe he do something.
*  Should he stay or should he go?
*  If the Lakers call to go to state and said LeBron wants to leave, give us Kaminga and
*  Klay Thompson in a first round pick.
*  Why would the Lakers take that?
*  Well they're losing LeBron in like two months.
*  The other options like Tyler Hero and Doug Ronson.
*  It's better to have LeBron for the two months than that.
*  So you'd rather have LeBron for the two months rather than.
*  As opposed to that Golden State garbage, yes.
*  I like Miami.
*  Miami makes sense to me.
*  So Hero and Robinson and Bealvish had a number one pick for Torian Prince and LeBron.
*  So then you have LeBron, Butler, Bam, Jaquez, a couple shooters.
*  That team could win.
*  Terry Rozier.
*  The Lakers can make their own move and keep LeBron and still go on the run that they went
*  on last year.
*  They're still going to get Bruce Brown.
*  I would keep LeBron too.
*  I'm glad we talked this out.
