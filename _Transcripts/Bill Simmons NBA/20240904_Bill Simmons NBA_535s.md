# Charles Barkley on the Future of ‘Inside the NBA’  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZaO5bMjLEA)
*  I have been very specific on my retirement.
*  So.
*  You're not retiring.
*  Well, I am at some point.
*  Come on.
*  You love this.
*  What are you gonna retire for?
*  You're still fantastic at this.
*  No, because I'm over 60.
*  Who cares?
*  60's the new 50.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  That's what all young people say.
*  Wait till your ass get my age.
*  So my original game plan was to retire at 60.
*  I made that.
*  And I had told TNT, I said, I'm retiring at 60.
*  And they're like, okay.
*  And I said, hey, I'm just giving y'all a heads up.
*  I'm retiring next year.
*  They're like, you gotta stay till the new deal is done.
*  I'm like, fuck.
*  Oh, cause they needed you for the negotiation?
*  Yes, but little did I know they were gonna fuck that up.
*  They should have.
*  And I was like, I said, you know what?
*  You guys been great to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll stay for two more years.
*  So next year was supposed to be my last year
*  and I was gonna walk off into the sunset.
*  But little did I know, like I just said,
*  cause it would have been perfect
*  to pass the torch to Vince Carter or Jamal Crawford.
*  Hey, 25 years.
*  Thank y'all.
*  I'll be 62 years old.
*  And the market race came.
*  I said, oh, this is actually even better for me.
*  I can walk away after next year
*  and don't have to worry about going to another network.
*  Yeah.
*  And so when they came to meet with me,
*  they're like, we wanna keep doing the show.
*  I was like, what?
*  We don't even have basketball.
*  And so it really put through me for a loop.
*  The only good thing about it,
*  I got to keep a lot of people their job.
*  Yeah.
*  But I made it very clear.
*  Man, I'm not gonna keep working forever.
*  I'm gonna do at least one more year
*  so everybody can keep their job for another year.
*  First of all, I have zero idea what we're gonna do.
*  Let me get that out of the way.
*  Well, you have basketball next year at least.
*  Yeah, so we were already gonna do next year
*  no matter what.
*  But they said they wanna keep doing the show
*  a year after that.
*  And I said, guys, I can't just keep working to be working.
*  I tell people, yo man, this ain't my real job.
*  This is my sucker job.
*  And I said, and listen, I ain't worried about death.
*  It's the big fella gonna come get us all.
*  But I don't wanna die on TV.
*  I'll be 62 years old.
*  I've been working or been in the limelight since I was 18.
*  I'm a grandpa now.
*  You've 40 years since like that
*  when you did make the Olympic team when you should have.
*  So I'm like, man, I'm good.
*  Y'all have given me the greatest life a person could have.
*  I love y'all.
*  Thank y'all, thank y'all, thank y'all.
*  But at some point, I wanna retire sooner than later,
*  plain and simple.
*  I don't think you're gonna retire.
*  Well, it's gonna be interesting
*  because I have zero idea what we're gonna do
*  because we won't have basketball.
*  But you're talking a year from now.
*  Yes, but I have zero idea what we're gonna do.
*  Would it make more sense for one of the partners
*  just to grab the show though?
*  What makes it even funnier,
*  they don't even have no idea what we're gonna do.
*  So I'm sitting in this meeting in Philly.
*  I'm like, we wanna keep doing the show.
*  I was like, what do you mean?
*  Like, we wanna keep y'all together.
*  I says, well, I would consider that
*  because I want all my friends to keep their jobs.
*  I said, what are we gonna do?
*  They're like, we haven't figured that out yet.
*  I'm like, what?
*  I says, we won't have basketball.
*  What the hell are we gonna do?
*  And so that's the thing.
*  That's the thing that's fascinating.
*  Like I say, I know we got one more year with the NBA,
*  then we're going to lose it.
*  And they wanna do the show at least another year,
*  but I'm like, we don't even have basketball.
*  We're going to pay for highlights.
*  So they were saying, we'll figure it out,
*  but they just lost the NBA.
*  So tough maybe to have the trust
*  that the next decision is gonna go awesome.
*  It's like, you just fucking lost the NBA
*  over like four conference finals games.
*  And I got a truck, y'all.
*  It's like,
*  it is what it is, brother.
*  Well, listen, I mean, it's certainly the most imitated show.
*  I still think people don't completely understand
*  why it works so well.
*  You're the biggest reason,
*  but for people with chemistry, with a host that drives it,
*  I remember coming to see you in Atlanta in like 2002
*  to write about it.
*  And the show hasn't changed really since 2002.
*  It's the same formula.
*  And yet everybody else fucks it up.
*  Like remember the women's basketball
*  in the college tournament and the ESPN,
*  they had a really good studio show with three people
*  and they were excellent.
*  And then it got to the final four and they're like,
*  we're gonna bring in two more people.
*  Now we have five.
*  It's like, you guys just fucking struck oil with the show.
*  What are you doing?
*  Yeah.
*  They can't help themselves.
*  If people would understand,
*  you have to have a mixture of basketball and fun.
*  And like people like, you can't be all fun
*  and no basketball.
*  You can't be all basketball
*  because you're trying to reach two different audiences.
*  I always tell myself,
*  we already got the basketball fans.
*  We already got that.
*  If people gonna watch basketball, they're gonna watch.
*  The key is can we make it fun for the wife,
*  the girlfriends and the kids?
*  And they give us complete control.
*  And they give you time to talk.
*  They give you seven to 10 minute segments,
*  which is another thing people don't realize.
*  A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
*  They give you time to breathe and do your thing.
*  Yeah, it's funny.
*  Hey Bill, I'll tell you something.
*  There's times when we're talking
*  and they're like, we gotta go to commercial.
*  And we'll be like, shut the fuck up.
*  We're not done.
*  Right, let's keep going.
*  Nobody wanna see another fucking commercial hold it.
*  Because like sometimes they'll be in your ear.
*  I like, hey, shut the fuck up.
*  We're still talking here.
*  Because I thought, you man, you can't.
*  Sometimes you need time to explain,
*  especially when you're talking about something serious.
*  But sometimes you're trying to explain something
*  and they're in your damn ear like,
*  we gotta go, we gotta go.
*  I said, what the hell are we going?
*  We hear from seven to two in the morning.
*  You can't hold a commercial for another damn minute.
*  Well, you guys figured it out, whatever it was.
*  The other thing that people I think miss with it is
*  the four of you would have that combo anyway.
*  I know we've made these points a million times.
*  But it has to have four people,
*  and I think it's either four or three.
*  It shouldn't be five.
*  But four people that would hang out and talk basketball
*  regardless of whether the cameras were on.
*  And they never figured that part either.
*  They'll just throw, they think it's like a fantasy team.
*  And we'll see what happens with these new deals
*  when Amazon and NBC are putting people together.
*  And they're like, whoa, we got this.
*  Got this and we're gonna.
*  They put no thought into,
*  well, would those three people hang out together?
*  That's what's gonna be fascinating.
*  In what respect?
*  Like, putting their teams together.
*  Yeah.
*  You just can't cherry pick people.
*  Like you said, they gotta have chemistry.
*  You say like, yeah, I wanna hang out
*  and talk basketball with this guy or this girl.
*  So who NBC and Amazon put together is gonna be amazing.
*  I'm still not ruling you out.
*  It still feels like the smartest solution to all this
*  is just to take the entire infrastructure you guys have
*  and move it to a different network that is basketball.
*  And I don't understand why that wouldn't happen.
*  Well, number one, I don't think Ernie would go.
*  I don't think Ernie would go.
*  Because he doesn't wanna leave Atlanta?
*  Ernie would, yeah, Ernie would leave Atlanta ever.
*  So filming in Atlanta.
*  Well.
*  Listen man. We gotta work on Ernie.
*  Hey, everything is on the board.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, hey Bill, as I told you earlier,
*  we have zero fucking idea
*  what's gonna happen after this year, zero.
*  Well, I think you have like three or four more retirements
*  in you over the next like 12 months.
