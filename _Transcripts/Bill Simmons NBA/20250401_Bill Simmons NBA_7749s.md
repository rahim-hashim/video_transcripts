# Zach Lowe on 2025’s 25 Most Intriguing NBA Playoff Guys | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0)
*  Alright, my old friend Zach Lewis here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=0.0s)]
*  He is joining the ringer and Spotify. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=26.16s)]
*  We're back baby. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=28.2s)]
*  We launched the podcast that is called the Zach low show. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=29.86s)]
*  It's going to be Monday next week. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=33.339999999999996s)]
*  There's a YouTube channel that's already up and you're going to be doing a bunch of stuff [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=35.3s)]
*  for us and I couldn't be more excited about it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=39.34s)]
*  This is a great week. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  It's good to see you too. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Uh, and yeah, new name, new show, new graphics, new everything. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And I've been paying attention to the NBA season as I normally would have, even though [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=49.82s)]
*  I didn't have a job. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  I've been watching probably even more than usual because I've had no other work to do. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  I've been meeting people in the city when they've come in and I've traveled to some [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=59.22s)]
*  places so I've kept my finger on the pulse in preparation for a potential in season return, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=62.1s)]
*  which is now imminent. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I was worried you might just sit out the whole year and that, and we wouldn't [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  get you for the awards, the playoffs, anything. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=74.58s)]
*  But I think to me, the catalyst was the Luca trade. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=77.38s)]
*  That was the moment where you were like, Oh my God, I need a platform. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=80.34s)]
*  Give me a platform right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=84.14s)]
*  So I was asleep when that happened because I don't have a job. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=85.82s)]
*  And so I didn't have to be up at 12 30 in the morning or 12 15 in the morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=89.46s)]
*  I woke up the next day and obviously my phone is just, there's a million notifications that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=92.94s)]
*  I didn't even look at. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=97.02s)]
*  I was like, I guess Jimmy Butler got traded overnight. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=98.02s)]
*  I guess that finally happened. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  And then like eight more minutes passed and I looked, I was like, Oh my God. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  And then I still, I still, I mean, we're going to talk about the Lakers a lot. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=104.61999999999999s)]
*  And I watched their game against the Rockets last night. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  One of my buddies, Nathan is a huge Rockets fan. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=110.38s)]
*  I went over and watched with him and we're almost two months out and I'm like, I just [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=112.34s)]
*  can't even believe that he's on their team. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  And having been to a Lakers game recently, like they can't even believe that he's on [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=120.1s)]
*  their team. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  And it's, I feel the same way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  Every time I watch them, there's three or four moments where I just kind of step out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=128.54s)]
*  of the watching experience and go, how did this happen? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=132.66s)]
*  How did we let this happen? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  How did we let this happen to the Lakers? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=137.88s)]
*  What were some of the other big things that, you know, you were gone for four fifths of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=140.3s)]
*  the season. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=144.46s)]
*  What were some of the other stuff you wished? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=145.46s)]
*  Oh man, I wish I had a column or, Oh man, I wish I had a podcast. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=146.98s)]
*  I would love to chime in on this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=151.3s)]
*  What were some of the big stories? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=152.78s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=153.78s)]
*  I got laid off on a Wednesday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=155.06s)]
*  I flew back on a Thursday. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=158.18s)]
*  I had several friends meet me at my house along with my wife with alcohol and two or [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  three drinks into that night. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  Carl Anthony Towns got traded to the Knicks in what I would rate as like a top 10 most [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  interesting trade that has happened in the 15 plus years I've covered the NBA. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  And we were just laughing at the fortune of like what timing, like you don't see a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=180.3s)]
*  lot of trades of that magnitude right before the season starts. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=185.22s)]
*  So that was one just, I mean, the all time will never have a perfect storm of disaster [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=188.82000000000002s)]
*  seasons like we've had in Phoenix, Philadelphia and Dallas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=196.14s)]
*  Like it's just incomprehensible how badly all of those things have gone and all in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=199.26s)]
*  totally different ways, some self-inflicted others not. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=203.38s)]
*  And I just think, you know, I'm just looking at the standings, the jog of my memory. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=207.1s)]
*  I mean, the excellence of the calves and the thunder would have been really fun to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=211.54s)]
*  talk about all year. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=217.33999999999997s)]
*  And I still, you know, some some outlets, including Spotify, Ringer accepted. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=220.1s)]
*  I still don't think those teams have been talked enough about enough. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=225.58s)]
*  I mean, the thunder are 63 and 12 with like the greatest net rating in the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=229.58s)]
*  history of basketball. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=234.66000000000003s)]
*  And I just, you know, so many interesting storylines like, oh, here comes the, here [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=237.18s)]
*  comes the Chet Hartnestein combination. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  How's that going to work? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=242.5s)]
*  How's Caruso fitting enough to bench the calves and Kenny Atkinson reworking their [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=243.62s)]
*  offense and Donovan Mitchell being sold on a lesser role. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=247.34s)]
*  And you and me both, we're going to be wrong a lot. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=250.62s)]
*  One of the things we've both been right on is amid all the, maybe Evan Mobley is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=253.66s)]
*  a bit overhyped. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=258.14s)]
*  Maybe he's like, he's like, you know, whoever bad big man 2.0, I won't name any [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  names. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  We were like, no, we're keeping the stock. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  This guy's going to be awesome. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=266.34s)]
*  And he's been awesome. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  And he's been awesome. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=269.34s)]
*  Not in the way that people necessarily like the low hanging fruit with him was, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=271.06s)]
*  well, he's just got to shoot a lot of threes and make more threes. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  And the calves were like, you can shoot some more threes and it would be helpful. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=278.18s)]
*  But how about we redesign our offense, enable you as a passer, and how about you [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=281.78s)]
*  just beat the hell out of people inside and get super aggressive and physical. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's really worked. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  And I just, those, those things jump out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=290.62s)]
*  Sorry, you asked an open ended question. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  I haven't talked to do a microphone in a long time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=295.14s)]
*  I got a lot of takes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=297.46s)]
*  There was a lot of stuff to work with there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=298.7s)]
*  No, I think Mobley and Tatum are in the finals of, Oh, I didn't realize you were [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=300.62s)]
*  kind of a bully deep down. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=306.26s)]
*  Both of those guys, I think have asserted themselves in ways that we always [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=308.17999999999995s)]
*  wondered is it in there and Tatum who's been awesome, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=311.73999999999995s)]
*  He's been one of the top three or four players in the league for most of the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=315.7s)]
*  decade, top five, whatever rankings you want to do, but he's in there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=318.61999999999995s)]
*  He's first team all NBA multiple times. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=321.9s)]
*  There was that small piece of like, does he, does he really want to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  stick it to the other team? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=328.29999999999995s)]
*  Does he want to eviscerate the guy he's going against? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=329.7s)]
*  Does he want to send a message? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=332.17999999999995s)]
*  Does he want to bully somebody? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  Is he want to take offense to how he's being defended? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  And I don't know whether it was, you know, not winning the awards during the, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=338.58s)]
*  during the championship season last year, what happened in the Olympics or just [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=342.06s)]
*  age, the fact that he's 27, but I, I personally see a little bit of an edge [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=345.38s)]
*  to him that I don't think was there last year. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=352.02s)]
*  And I think it's really helped the Celtics team. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=354.66s)]
*  You look at like, I think they're 15 and one in their last 16 playing for nothing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  They're the two seed. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=359.7s)]
*  They've been the two seed forever, but there's an edge to them now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=360.98s)]
*  And they go on the road. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=363.9s)]
*  I feel like they're, they have that little swagger that I think you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=364.97999999999996s)]
*  need on a back to back team. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=368.38s)]
*  I think he's a big reason for it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=369.62s)]
*  And then Moby, same thing, like just seems like he's not a pushover anymore. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=370.9s)]
*  Anybody else in that group with those two that dug down and found something [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=376.38s)]
*  that you were surprised by as a team or as individual players, individuals. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=380.82s)]
*  You're, you're springing this one on me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=389.62s)]
*  As, as you do, as you're, as you're, I guess Reeves would be another one, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  That had a little more in there than maybe we were. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=395.94000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=398.54s)]
*  I don't want to spoil our, our, our coming talk. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=398.62s)]
*  Reeves is Reeves is going to make all star in all star team at some point, if [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=402.38000000000005s)]
*  not multiple all star teams Reeves is, is very, very good. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=406.3s)]
*  Um, I've been impressed until, you know, it's been a little rocky the last couple [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=409.78000000000003s)]
*  of weeks, but I liked at least offensively how cat has attacked his season in New [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=413.42s)]
*  York. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=419.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=420.1s)]
*  I was a Cade stockholder. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=421.3s)]
*  I actually think Cade's level of improvement has been maybe a little [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=423.42s)]
*  overblown, but he's been awesome and he's probably going to make an all NBA team [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=426.54s)]
*  this year. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  That's been fun to watch. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=429.74s)]
*  And I know that you are just, I've listened enough to know that you just enjoy [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=431.22s)]
*  the fact that the Pistons want to fight everybody every night and including a, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=434.62s)]
*  well, potentially very dangerous one in Minnesota the other night involving all [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  the usual, like round up the usual suspects. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  And, uh, and here we are. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  So those, those are, those are some, the fight in Brooklyn nets were fun for a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=447.02s)]
*  minute, the Clippers, we're going to talk about the Clippers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=451.09999999999997s)]
*  If you had told me the Clippers are going to be 43 and 32 in this four team [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=454.58s)]
*  morass for five to eight with Kawhi having played less than half the season. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  And look on a lot of nights like, Oh, like, is this a, do I, do I gotta like [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=464.78s)]
*  get back into this again? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  Like, am I going to fall for the, the, not fall for it, but that, like, I [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  don't see Ty loose name coming up a lot in coach of the year. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=476.78s)]
*  And I think that he at least should be like in the, in the third place, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  second place talk. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=484.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=485.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, I, I, you know, I w when I went that Clipper, okay. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=486.78s)]
*  See game last week and I was watching the intensity and the physicality of it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=489.5s)]
*  And it kind of helped frame where my brain was for the playoffs because I feel [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  like whatever competitiveness I was watching that game and how high level it was. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=499.26s)]
*  So I left the game and I'm driving home and I'm like, how many teams could [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=504.29999999999995s)]
*  actually get to that? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=507.9s)]
*  And it's interesting that the Clippers are one of the teams, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=509.94s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen with the West. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=512.1s)]
*  Like Memphis is still in the middle of the pack and the playoff thing, but they [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=513.42s)]
*  might be the eight seed by the time we actually finished the season, there's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=516.3s)]
*  going to be, it's going to be roulette left and right, but I see a team like [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=519.6999999999999s)]
*  Minnesota and I think like fundamentally they could get to what I watched in that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=523.5799999999999s)]
*  game, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=527.3s)]
*  Intensity, competitiveness, defense, switching, um, physicality. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=528.3399999999999s)]
*  I think the Warriors might be able to get there as weird as it sounds with how [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=534.3399999999999s)]
*  late they've gotten in the season. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  The question for me is the Lakers because they're big and we went to the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=539.42s)]
*  Laker game together last week. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=542.5s)]
*  They're missing a rim protector. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=544.5s)]
*  LeBron has to rebound, I think a little more than maybe he's ever had as a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=546.78s)]
*  burden in his career and same for Luca. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=551.5s)]
*  Like they're going to have to patch some stuff together, but ultimately it's a [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=554.3s)]
*  pretty physical team and kind of a different way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=557.9s)]
*  Um, do you think they have that in them? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=560.54s)]
*  That when we're talking about intensity, competitiveness, the defense, the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=562.54s)]
*  banging, we saw it last night. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=566.14s)]
*  It seems like they do, but I'm a little suspicious just because of how much of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=568.34s)]
*  the load is on a 40 year old LeBron. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=572.9s)]
*  Um, I think that's fair. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=575.14s)]
*  They're actually, they've actually been outscored with LeBron, Luca and Reeves [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=578.18s)]
*  all on the floor together. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=582.9s)]
*  And yet by the, and that's mostly because of defense. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=584.06s)]
*  I think all those guys are bought in to the right kind of style on offense. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=587.42s)]
*  I've talked to some of their coaches about it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=591.58s)]
*  They're like very, very excited by some of the off ball stuff, by some of the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=593.26s)]
*  motion that those guys have bought into. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=596.34s)]
*  And I do, I do, I mean, three to four series is going to be hard for a [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=598.74s)]
*  team with a 40 year old. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=603.86s)]
*  And once you get by the first round, it's every other day, relentlessly the whole [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=605.22s)]
*  way, but they have a level at least for an isolated period of time, maybe not [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=608.7s)]
*  six weeks, eight weeks, but I wouldn't count it out either, but they have a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=613.7s)]
*  level, I'm a believer. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=616.62s)]
*  Like they're, they're a strange team because they're huge. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=618.5s)]
*  Like they sometimes play three, they basically start three power forwards in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=622.54s)]
*  a center sometimes when they take the center out, they basically replace them [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=625.78s)]
*  with another power forward to the power forward size guys are two of the five [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=629.34s)]
*  greatest passers in recent, if not all time history of the NBA, Hachamurra has [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=634.22s)]
*  been great for them. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=640.34s)]
*  Vincent has been great in the last month. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=641.14s)]
*  Phinney Smith has been great. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=643.3s)]
*  They're non-center lineups have been, have been tough to deal with. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=644.5799999999999s)]
*  And they just have those two nasty Terminator passing chess master [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=647.9s)]
*  dudes at the top of it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=653.38s)]
*  Like I wouldn't want to, they beat the Rockets last night and like, I wouldn't, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=654.66s)]
*  I wouldn't want to play them. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=659.3s)]
*  I, I would think hard about picking them over essentially any team, but [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=660.2199999999999s)]
*  the Thunder in the playoffs. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=664.78s)]
*  And I don't think the Thunder loved that matchup either and have not loved that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=666.0999999999999s)]
*  matchup. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=669.5s)]
*  And by the way, you mentioned LeBron. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=669.8199999999999s)]
*  A lot of concern about, you know, his up and down play since he came [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=671.38s)]
*  back from another injury. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=674.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=676.18s)]
*  A couple, a couple of games where like the double digit streak seemed to be [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=676.8199999999999s)]
*  in semi jeopardy for a hot second. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=680.42s)]
*  I like all fair fine. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=683.9399999999999s)]
*  A he's 40 B like. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  Remember he guarded Yokech in the playoffs a couple of years ago and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=689.18s)]
*  guarded him pretty well. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=692.22s)]
*  And it was like a six or eight minute stretch. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=693.26s)]
*  And that's like all they could ask of him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=695.06s)]
*  Last night, JJ Reddick can go to this 40 year old dude and be like, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=697.02s)]
*  we just need you to guard Shen Gun for maybe the entire game. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=700.06s)]
*  Can you, can you go do it? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=703.18s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I'll bang, I'll bang with them the whole game. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=704.46s)]
*  Like that's deserves a lot of credit for that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=706.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=709.62s)]
*  And the thing that jumped out to me, seeing them a couple of times in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=709.8199999999999s)]
*  person recently is athletically, he doesn't. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=712.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=715.46s)]
*  I remember there was a moment with Carl Malone in the early 2000s where [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=715.5799999999999s)]
*  he still looked like Carl Malone and his hair was going, but physically [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=720.42s)]
*  he was about as imposing, but athletically there was just some slip [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=723.74s)]
*  and you could feel it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=727.62s)]
*  And you can feel that when Jordan was on the Wizards now, granted [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=728.54s)]
*  it was a different era, they have way better ways to stay at the top [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=731.3s)]
*  physically now, but you could see like, oh, he's losing this. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=735.3s)]
*  He's not. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=738.62s)]
*  Lebron don't have these moments where it's like, this guy looks [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=738.86s)]
*  athletically as devastating as he was 10 years ago. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=741.42s)]
*  He had that block last night in the Houston game where he was up and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=744.26s)]
*  he read it and it was like, you know, it wasn't a chase down block, but [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=748.54s)]
*  it was half court, but he was up in the air. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=751.54s)]
*  I was like, all right. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I think round one, I think it was like, I think it was [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=754.6999999999999s)]
*  round one is going to be a little easier for them with all the breaks. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=757.9s)]
*  Round two is where round two is the separate the men's from the men from [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=762.54s)]
*  the boys round and that's where the teams with the bench, like Cleveland [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=766.26s)]
*  and okay, saying Boston, it's such an advantage. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=769.5s)]
*  I mean, he's playing every other day. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=772.22s)]
*  If one day eight, if, if the play, if the, if the seven and eight seeds come [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=774.02s)]
*  out of this group of Clippers, Minnesota warriors, Grizzlies that are all [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=780.06s)]
*  jostling for those places. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  And one of the Dallas Sacramento Phoenix brigade of losers does not like [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=785.02s)]
*  somehow sneak in to one of those spots. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=790.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=793.14s)]
*  Every round one series is going to be a battle featuring a team that you [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=793.4599999999999s)]
*  could talk yourself into winning other than maybe Memphis, the way Memphis [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=798.9399999999999s)]
*  is sliding right now, but they have an upside that's pretty high too. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=802.9399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, can we just say before we get to it, cause I don't know how [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=805.98s)]
*  much time we're going to talk about them. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=808.66s)]
*  How embarrassing is it that the Phoenix sons cannot catch for tent either the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=810.38s)]
*  Kings who can't beat anybody right now or the Mavericks who finally got some of [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=817.0200000000001s)]
*  their players back, but have largely had like no players and the sons still [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=821.46s)]
*  can't catch them. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=825.7800000000001s)]
*  And I know you and Rosilla have talked about how pathetic they've looked [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=826.46s)]
*  defensively in a lot of games, how disengaged they've, but like these teams [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=828.9000000000001s)]
*  are begging the begging to become these teams have been the equivalent of Eastern [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=832.58s)]
*  conference play in teams for like a month, which is a horrible insult to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=837.62s)]
*  levy at any Western conference team. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=841.14s)]
*  And the sons are like, we still can't catch it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=843.22s)]
*  We can't catch it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=845.5s)]
*  And they've had, if you kept a list of the expanded standings had a list of, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=847.3000000000001s)]
*  wow, you just didn't care tonight games other than the, uh, lottery teams and [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=853.94s)]
*  the teams that are tanking Phoenix would easily be the number one. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=859.0200000000001s)]
*  I mean, speaking of that, how many, how many emails did the league send? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=861.82s)]
*  Danny age before they finally had to find the jazz. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=867.06s)]
*  The one of the great parlor games of the season has been looking at the jazz box [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=869.98s)]
*  score every night and being like, all right, so who didn't play? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=874.3s)]
*  And yesterday it was Walter Kessler, Walker Kessler DNP returned to conditioning. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=877.06s)]
*  Lowry Mark is Lowry market in dead. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=883.1s)]
*  John Collins on a beach in, in, uh, in Mexico somewhere. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=885.78s)]
*  Like it's so embarrassing. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=889.62s)]
*  The jazz they're all the Raptors have been embarrassing for the past month. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=891.06s)]
*  Like, Hey, we're just not gonna play any of our guys in the second half of any [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=894.46s)]
*  close games, the jazz had been embarrassing the entire year and Phoenix has somehow [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=896.9000000000001s)]
*  been more embarrassing than the jazz relative to the expectations. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=901.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=906.82s)]
*  I got a lot of takes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=907.1s)]
*  I haven't talked to do a microphone. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=907.98s)]
*  I haven't been able to make fun of the 26 teams would trade front. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=910.5400000000001s)]
*  We trade places with us. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=914.7800000000001s)]
*  Matt ish via statement. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=915.9000000000001s)]
*  That's going to be in Springfield one day. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=916.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=918.9s)]
*  With 26 Euro league teams, 2026. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=922.86s)]
*  I think he just spent all the teams, even college G league, uh, Europe. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=926.22s)]
*  That had been, yeah, the, the, uh, Phoenix and Philly. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=931.1s)]
*  I think it's been a really, really crazy, weird season, but I think when you see all [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=935.5s)]
*  of these teams that are either falling apart down the stretch, throwing away [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=939.8199999999999s)]
*  second halves, resting guys are sitting guys out for the season with fake injuries. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=942.9s)]
*  Like foot contusion back, back stiffness. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=948.1s)]
*  Like we're, we're, we've never been better at fake injuries. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=952.22s)]
*  This is another case for me that we should be at 70 games. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=955.7s)]
*  Why do we need this extra month of 12 teams? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=958.9s)]
*  Not giving a shit. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=961.7s)]
*  How shocked were you when Zion got shut down for the season the other day? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=962.74s)]
*  Like just like, like, was it the equivalent of the Luca trade level of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=966.02s)]
*  shock that the Pelicans had to shut down Zion for the season? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=969.5s)]
*  I was amazed. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=972.38s)]
*  He played 30 games and then they had the list of all the games he's played. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=973.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, when you look at the Zion and Jah, that combo and that draft and how few [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=977.14s)]
*  of those guys have actually been, how few times those guys have actually been [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=981.86s)]
*  available in games, pretty incredible for how much time we spent talking about. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=984.86s)]
*  That lottery coming up, how important it was, how transformative it could be. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=989.38s)]
*  And then, you know, those guys could stay in the court. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=993.3s)]
*  That's why all to talk about what happened with Taylor Jenkins, you know, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=997.26s)]
*  what, what happened with Noah LaRoche, what happened with Isalo, this, this, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1001.38s)]
*  this finished coach that they've hired and now promoted. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1005.34s)]
*  Why now? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1008.1s)]
*  Why was nine games left? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1009.34s)]
*  Well, they're sliding. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1010.34s)]
*  They can't beat any, any good teams. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1011.34s)]
*  Their record against above 500 teams is terrible. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1013.0600000000001s)]
*  They had expectations, blah, blah. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1015.14s)]
*  It shouldn't be the sixth paragraph of that, that you mentioned that John [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1017.78s)]
*  Morant just plays half the games and Brandon, Brandon Clark's injury was a [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1021.1800000000001s)]
*  sneaky big blow to their team. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1025.34s)]
*  He was a big glue guy for them, a lot of their best lineups. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1026.94s)]
*  And like, if you take out your best, if not your, maybe your best bench [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1029.94s)]
*  player, but certainly your best backup big and your star plays half the games. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1034.7s)]
*  Like you're, yeah, you're not going to beat a lot of the above 500 teams [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1038.94s)]
*  in the Western conference is going to be hard. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1042.42s)]
*  And the vibes are, are off. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1044.74s)]
*  I think, uh, you know, people have been writing about it, but I think the teams [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1047.78s)]
*  that have been interacting with them and playing them are kind of like, ah, you [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1051.22s)]
*  know, same thing with Phoenix, you could feel it early on with that Phoenix season. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1055.7s)]
*  I think to me, the Philly thing was not surprising to me at all. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1058.9s)]
*  Um, I went under on them and the over unders, I didn't like the Paul George [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1062.82s)]
*  side, signing was trying to be careful about how I framed it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1068.1s)]
*  I thought it was the wrong city for him. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1070.9s)]
*  I thought it was super risky. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1072.42s)]
*  I knew why they had to do it, but I wasn't surprised how it played out. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1073.5s)]
*  I was, I'm still stunned by Phoenix and you know, it's one of those things you [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1077.22s)]
*  look back and you're like, how did we get this so wrong? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1080.9s)]
*  Why did we think like Budenhoz was going to come in and unleash this awesome [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1084.18s)]
*  offense and it's been the opposite. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1088.54s)]
*  Why did we misread the chemistry thing? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1090.3s)]
*  Why did we discount role players? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1092.14s)]
*  I still don't have an answer because if you're doing the OMBA exercises, Booker [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1094.42s)]
*  and Durant credential wise are kind of in the mix for a third team, and yet I [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1098.82s)]
*  don't know if I can do it because of how bad that team's been week to week to week. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1104.06s)]
*  I don't have an answer. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1108.62s)]
*  So you're watching this from home. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1109.66s)]
*  Are you like, what would you have written if you could have written [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1112.54s)]
*  a son's piece in January? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1115.26s)]
*  Well, I mean that, that the offense is just fine and fine. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1117.62s)]
*  Is it going to be good enough? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1121.58s)]
*  And it's not dynamic enough. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1122.78s)]
*  It's still not dynamic enough. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1124.1799999999998s)]
*  Um, you know, you can go back and look at the transactions that they've made. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1126.3s)]
*  We don't even need to get into the Durant thing, but just the Aitin [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1131.2199999999998s)]
*  Tumani Kamara who's really good in Portland for Nurkic thing is turned into a [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1134.7399999999998s)]
*  disaster and then you have to salary dump Nurkic and attach more stuff to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1140.26s)]
*  salary dump them, uh, and Beal just doesn't play. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1143.3799999999999s)]
*  Like Beal still doesn't play enough games to get the offense running at full [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1146.5s)]
*  throttle and then the defense is, you know, the bottom 10 in defense is [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1152.5800000000002s)]
*  basically all the tanking teams and Phoenix and some of their bad defensive [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1156.38s)]
*  games are the mistakes, the non rotations are just suggestive of a team that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1160.1000000000001s)]
*  doesn't care and, and they have better games than that sometimes, but sometimes [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1165.66s)]
*  it's like, no, no one, no one rotated from the weak side, like no one even [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1170.5800000000002s)]
*  seems angry that no one rotated from the weak side. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1174.5s)]
*  No one gives them my bad for not rotating from the weak side. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1177.18s)]
*  Just like, all right, onto the next one. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1180.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1182.66s)]
*  If you're going one to 10, how close knit does a team look when you're [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1182.9s)]
*  watching them in person and 10 would be any team that Tim Duncan was on where [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1186.26s)]
*  he had his arm around every single player in his team during every time out [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1190.62s)]
*  and every foul stoppage and that was just the feel good, we love each other [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1193.66s)]
*  kind of era that was one of the reasons like I'll defend Tim Duncan to the death. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1197.9s)]
*  His teams always had that tightness, that closeness. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  You could see it when you went to the games and the sons were like a [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1205.38s)]
*  one and a half or two. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1208.34s)]
*  I was, I was shocked. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1209.8600000000001s)]
*  They just looked like vessels passing in the night timeouts, nobody talking, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1211.6200000000001s)]
*  people shooting foul shots, just five guys standing in different things, like [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1217.06s)]
*  all the check marks of things you don't want. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1220.42s)]
*  And you know, I think you and I are. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1223.1000000000001s)]
*  I hate using the word defenders, but I think we've been pretty pro KD and his [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1226.14s)]
*  legacy and how great he's been over the, over the last almost two decades. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1230.38s)]
*  It gets tough when you look at these last few years, I think it's going to become [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1235.3400000000001s)]
*  part of how people remember him, that he was on just a series of unhappy teams. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1239.0200000000002s)]
*  He still has a chance to fix it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1243.46s)]
*  This may be this summer, wherever he goes, maybe with after his max kind, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1245.6200000000001s)]
*  he's already talked about how he'll take a minimum contract to end his [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1250.0200000000002s)]
*  career on a good team, but it's not nothing. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1252.7800000000002s)]
*  This has been four years of, what's wrong with KD's team? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1256.7s)]
*  I don't want to do the Durant thing now. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1261.7s)]
*  Um, the Durant what if thing, but I will say that I have long been so fascinated [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1264.1799999999998s)]
*  with Durant that after the Warriors won their second championship, and it was [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1270.1s)]
*  largely anticlimactic, the only piece I could think of to write the headline was [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1275.58s)]
*  what does Kevin Durant want? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1280.1s)]
*  And it was a lot about how he had been unfulfilled by winning the first [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1281.7s)]
*  championship. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1284.62s)]
*  And I talked to him and I talked to tons of people who had been around him. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1285.82s)]
*  And literally three nights ago, watching an NBA game with a buddy, asking me, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1288.26s)]
*  he was asking me about Kevin Durant. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1293.1799999999998s)]
*  And I said, man, I don't really want to write a book. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1294.34s)]
*  It's one of the things I thought about during this time, not the right time for [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1297.4199999999998s)]
*  me, but boy, what I love to write the Kevin Durant book, like I just think his [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1300.5s)]
*  career and the fork in the road of the 2016 off season and the reverse engineering [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1304.3s)]
*  you could do the what ifs, all the paths not taken, uh, is just endlessly going to [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1310.22s)]
*  be fascinating because talent wise and statistics wise, there's like no question [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1314.8600000000001s)]
*  this guy's one of the 10 to 12 best players that has ever played and there's [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1319.38s)]
*  been nobody like him ever stylistically. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1322.74s)]
*  And anyway, that's it. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1325.18s)]
*  No more, no more KD unless we talk about where he's going to get traded. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1327.42s)]
*  I think it's fair to, even though LeBron has the most points ever, I think KD has [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1331.5800000000002s)]
*  a legitimate argument for best scoring forward in the history of the league. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1336.78s)]
*  When you look at like the peak years he had plus the totality of all the seasons, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1341.34s)]
*  things like that, you mentioned all the what ifs though, just one thing, and then [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1346.3799999999999s)]
*  we'll move on. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1348.94s)]
*  Um, the Seattle thing I think is a bigger what if than 2016, if that team just [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1350.06s)]
*  stays in Seattle and that was, I think that should have been a top seven or eight [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1355.5s)]
*  market just from an owner spending money. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1362.1s)]
*  They had all this money moving in from the tech world that was already there and [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1365.22s)]
*  that was going to keep getting bigger. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1368.98s)]
*  And I just think there's this alternate universe where Howard Schultz doesn't [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1370.98s)]
*  sell, the Sonics stay there and Durant's still in Seattle and he's the most [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1374.5s)]
*  beloved athlete in the history of the city. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1380.1000000000001s)]
*  Like that's other, or at least it's Ken Griffey, but he's in the running for [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1382.6200000000001s)]
*  most beloved Seattle athlete ever. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1386.26s)]
*  And I really think that's a parallel universe that could exist. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1387.7s)]
*  He never leaves. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1391.1000000000001s)]
*  That team grows together. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1392.6200000000001s)]
*  They spend money. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1394.02s)]
*  They win titles and we're discussing them in a completely different way. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1394.98s)]
*  And I think that's real. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1398.74s)]
*  Let me, I live about as far from Seattle as possible in the NBA market. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1401.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1407.58s)]
*  The Sonics have not existed for what? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1407.98s)]
*  17 years, 18 years now, something like that. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1410.14s)]
*  Um, I still have a Sonics conversation with somebody in New York or [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1413.22s)]
*  Connecticut every other week, every month. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1419.82s)]
*  I see kids who have never were not alive when the Sonics existed, wearing [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1424.02s)]
*  the green and yellow, like just throwback stuff that their parents got. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1429.22s)]
*  The Sonics matters so much to so many people and something about that color [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1433.18s)]
*  scheme, the Peyton Kemp teams, the frenetic way they played has stuck in [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1438.74s)]
*  the collective memory and even like outlasted the generation of fans who were [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1444.1399999999999s)]
*  there and obviously we all agree like they need to come back in Seattle. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1447.82s)]
*  The supersonics need to exist again. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1452.42s)]
*  Well, it's going to happen, especially after the Celtics got six billion plus. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1455.14s)]
*  Um, which was the number Adams over wanted the whole time. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1460.38s)]
*  I talked about it last summer. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1463.1000000000001s)]
*  They wanted to get to six. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1464.3400000000001s)]
*  Now they can get six for the two expansion teams. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1465.46s)]
*  I'm not positive who the two teams are going to be. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1468.5800000000002s)]
*  I think it's a hundred percent Vegas and 90% Seattle. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1470.66s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1476.14s)]
*  Um, but I'm really hoping in Seattle, if it's not one of the expansion teams, I [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1477.1000000000001s)]
*  think there's a couple of teams that could potentially be franchise movers. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1480.74s)]
*  We're going to take a break and come back and play. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1485.54s)]
*  Uh, we had to do a gimmick on your return to the pot. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1488.38s)]

*  Um, but you know what else is better together than David Tyree and Eli Manning? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1622.06s)]
*  I can't believe I'm praising them. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1626.58s)]
*  Bundling your home and auto insurance with the personal price plan from state [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1628.38s)]
*  farm, the personal price plan lets you call the place so you can choose the right [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1632.7s)]
*  coverage at a price that's right for you. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1636.02s)]
*  So talk to a state farm agent today to learn how you can bundle and save with [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1639.3s)]
*  the personal price plan, like a good neighbor state farm is there. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1643.06s)]
*  Prices are based on rating plans that vary by state coverage options are [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1646.54s)]
*  selected by the customer availability, amount of discounts and savings and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1650.74s)]
*  eligibility vary by state. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1655.02s)]
*  Hey, before we do our gimmick, can we talk briefly about Lakers Houston last night? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1657.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1662.06s)]
*  Cause I watched the whole game. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1662.18s)]
*  I was really interested in Houston and how they would play the Lakers and what a [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1664.82s)]
*  weird matchup that is and like the amount of athletes they have, could they [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1669.98s)]
*  basically just kind of overrun the Lakers a little, a little like what the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1675.1s)]
*  bulls did the game I went to when the bulls just tried basically ran them off [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1678.4199999999998s)]
*  the court and the Lakers fell asleep and they let it happen. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1681.8999999999999s)]
*  And it was like, well, what, what would this look like? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1684.9399999999998s)]
*  What would this look like as they whip all of these athletes at the Lakers for [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1686.82s)]
*  two and a half straight hours? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1690.82s)]
*  And my fear in the back of my head for the Rockets was this is going to be a [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1693.4599999999998s)]
*  close game in the last eight minutes and the Lakers are just going to out execute [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1696.74s)]
*  them and I'm not going to love the shots. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1700.26s)]
*  The Rockets took, there's going to be those mismatches. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1702.5s)]
*  The toughest thing with the Lakers now is you have those three guys. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1705.86s)]
*  And the third guy is Reeves who is a guy that on most teams, I think is now like [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1710.42s)]
*  a 23 to 25 points a game guy who can not only create his own shop, but create [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1714.94s)]
*  shots for other people. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1719.26s)]
*  And now you're putting your worst defender on him and you're just constantly [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1720.9s)]
*  trying to, it's like whack them all, trying to figure out who do you stop? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1723.7s)]
*  And the Rockets lost. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1727.3s)]
*  And I don't think it was an accident. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1728.58s)]
*  I think if those teams played in a playoff series, that would be the result. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1730.14s)]
*  What was your take watching it? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1733.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1735.42s)]
*  I mean, the Lakers are a big team and your little guy, your Fred Van Vliet is [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1735.6200000000001s)]
*  either Gar-Gard Reeves or if Finney Smith's on the floor, maybe Finney Smith [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1740.26s)]
*  instead of Hayes or maybe Hachamurra who got a couple of post-ups last night in [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1745.0600000000002s)]
*  that kind of matchup and you know, the Lakers are running a lot of stuff where [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1748.5400000000002s)]
*  Reeves and LeBron will screen for each other away from the ball while Luca has [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1753.14s)]
*  it and that cutting is what teams don't want to switch because they don't want [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1756.9s)]
*  to switch a small guy onto LeBron and they have Luca just waiting for whatever [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1761.46s)]
*  pass opens up and when they don't switch, someone cuts open or there was a [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1765.66s)]
*  miscommunication, I think Finney Smith got a three in the second half last [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1770.38s)]
*  night out of it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1773.14s)]
*  They're just hard to beat in a chess match, no matter how athletic you are [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1774.18s)]
*  because they're big, but the Rockets, like if the Rockets could throw speed [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1777.7s)]
*  plus shooting at them, that's a different kind of equation for the Lakers. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1782.0600000000002s)]
*  It's just speed, but not enough shooting, not enough shot making. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1787.0600000000002s)]
*  You saw what the Rockets last night, they still can't decide. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1790.3000000000002s)]
*  You know, Jalen Green's on the bench in the fourth quarter late in the game, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1793.5400000000002s)]
*  you know, presumably their quote unquote best offensive player. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1797.74s)]
*  I don't think he is. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1800.42s)]
*  I think Shen Goon is, but then there was minutes in the fourth quarter where [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1801.18s)]
*  Shen Goon's on the bench for a long time. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1804.26s)]
*  They're playing Jabari Smith at center. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1805.7800000000002s)]
*  They're not even playing Smith, they're playing five wings and I'm sitting there [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1807.1000000000001s)]
*  thinking like, I think a lot of this offense has just got to run through [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1810.38s)]
*  Shen Goon and, but LeBron, they got a takeaway on an entry pass late in that [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1812.98s)]
*  game. We all saw this coming for the Rockets. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1816.82s)]
*  It's why they're going to be maybe the most interesting team in the NBA [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1820.46s)]
*  over the playoffs and depending on what happens in the playoffs after the playoffs. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1824.5s)]
*  But I, I don't, I mean, look, I think that would be, that series would be [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1828.98s)]
*  a really, really hard fought series. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1832.5s)]
*  I probably would, I guess I would probably pick the Lakers. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1833.9399999999998s)]
*  I haven't thought about it, but I would probably pick the Lakers just based [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1835.98s)]
*  on experience and reliability if they, if they stay healthy. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1839.06s)]
*  Houston is still the number two. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1843.46s)]
*  They have a, as we're taping this, they have a one loss, basically a one and a [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1845.54s)]
*  half game lead over Denver and the Lakers are kind of surging toward them. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1849.26s)]
*  But the two spot means you're looking at Golden State, Minnesota, the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1853.98s)]
*  Quippers, unless Memphis drops down there. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1857.26s)]
*  And I don't, I just feel like Houston, when I watched them as good as the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1860.54s)]
*  record's been and I've enjoyed them and I think they're in the running for [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1866.3799999999999s)]
*  league pass MVPs this year. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1869.8999999999999s)]
*  I feel like they're a year away. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1871.5s)]
*  They're a move away and I don't, the move probably involves [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1873.18s)]
*  Shangoon or green, but they're, they don't have that. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1876.42s)]
*  Like I got this guy in offense, which is why the Booker option would [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1880.1000000000001s)]
*  have been so interesting for them. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1885.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what they do, but don't you think like one year from now, I'm [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1887.3000000000002s)]
*  really interested to see where they are. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1891.66s)]
*  Oh, like, well, first of all, it's, it's funny. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1893.26s)]
*  I was talking about this with somebody yesterday in the league and it's like, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1895.7800000000002s)]
*  You know, look, we all know that they've kicked around both of the Phoenix stars. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1899.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1906.42s)]
*  And I think there's some division internally about the Durant question [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1906.82s)]
*  there email, Doka obviously has a history of the way I really likes him. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1910.3s)]
*  He had this person asked me, what, what, what do the Rockets do if they [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1915.38s)]
*  lose in the first round? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1918.06s)]
*  Like, and I think the implication was that would make them even hungrier to, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1919.3s)]
*  to go for like a big win now trade. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1924.26s)]
*  I said, well, let's flip it around. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1927.1000000000001s)]
*  What if they win around and they lose to Denver in seven games, like a really [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1928.1s)]
*  hard fought, like I can feel good about this outcome and my implication was, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1933.06s)]
*  does that make you more confident in staying the course? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1937.9399999999998s)]
*  And the scout that I was talking to flipped around and said, actually, it may [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1941.1399999999999s)]
*  make you think we're so close that we still should go for the right kind of [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1944.5s)]
*  like all in upgrade and it's just going to be interesting to see how they [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1949.5s)]
*  perform in the playoffs and what the implications of that are offensively. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1952.78s)]
*  I just don't think they're good enough, but you know, defensively toughness wise, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1957.3s)]
*  they have everything. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1961.6599999999999s)]
*  And one of my favorite subplots of the whole season has been the Steven Adams [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1962.54s)]
*  resurgence and the fact that they stumbled into this Adam Shen goon just [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1966.1399999999999s)]
*  worked. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1970.3s)]
*  I looked at the numbers of that lineup. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1970.8999999999999s)]
*  It's, it was, I think, I think they're now after last night plus 103 points in [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1973.4199999999998s)]
*  130 minutes with those two guys on the floor with an offensive rebounding rate [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1978.86s)]
*  that would rank in the hundredth percentile of all lineups and a defensive [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1983.42s)]
*  rebounding rate that would rank in the hundredth percentile of all lineups, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1986.8200000000002s)]
*  just beating the hell out of everybody. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1990.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it works. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1992.18s)]
*  I don't know how it works. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1992.98s)]
*  They're just so gigantic across the board. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1994.18s)]
*  A really interesting team. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1996.9s)]
*  They've drafted really well. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1998.38s)]
*  Reed Shepard doesn't play. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=1999.5s)]
*  Cam Whitmore doesn't play like they have good guys who don't play. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2000.8200000000002s)]
*  I know that's kind of the league now. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2004.0600000000002s)]
*  These teams are so deep that you have these dudes who would have been like six [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2006.0200000000002s)]
*  or seventh men on good playoff teams 10 years ago, who get DNPs. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2009.5400000000002s)]
*  I can't believe Adams. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2013.5400000000002s)]
*  Do you know how old he is? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2014.5400000000002s)]
*  He's only 24 years old. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2015.3400000000001s)]
*  No, he's older. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2016.94s)]
*  I think he's like 28. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2017.42s)]
*  No, he's like 22 years old. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2019.2600000000002s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2021.2600000000002s)]
*  Oh, you're obviously saying which Adams am I forgetting? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2022.7800000000002s)]
*  And Adam's like 28 or 29. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2025.22s)]
*  He's been around forever and you just feel like he's a veteran. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2027.3000000000002s)]
*  Oh, he's 31 now. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2031.5s)]
*  When are the all time? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2033.0600000000002s)]
*  Does it feel like he was on OKC like a hundred years ago playing with like Perk [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2033.9s)]
*  and you know, Derek Fisher? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2038.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2040.5s)]
*  He's a grizzled. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2040.66s)]
*  He's a grizzled veteran who was also a grizzly. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2041.3000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know what to make a Houston. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2045.7s)]
*  Fandel did neither when they we I found these cool. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2048.06s)]
*  They had these odds for making each round and you can look at it now. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2052.5s)]
*  Houston to make the Western finals right now. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2056.38s)]
*  So they'd have to win two rounds is plus 770. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2059.3s)]
*  And they have home court right now as it stands in round one and round two. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2063.94s)]
*  And Fandel is still like, go ahead, bet it eight to one odds. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2067.62s)]
*  I bet, I bet it's not going to hit. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2070.42s)]
*  So I think people agree in it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2072.86s)]
*  And you know, there's this with the veteran teams, Golden State, Lakers [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2074.62s)]
*  and Denver specifically, there's still such a fear factor with them. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2079.62s)]
*  Based on what the upside is and, and, you know, the pedigree that I think [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2085.42s)]
*  this is the hardest other than the OKC piece. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2090.58s)]
*  This is the hardest conference to figure out in a long time. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2093.5s)]
*  Well, who's going to make the Western finals? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2096.7400000000002s)]
*  You could talk me into six teams. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2099.02s)]
*  You could, you, it sounds disrespectful to the Rockets who are 49 and 27. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2100.9s)]
*  Their net rating is plus five for 100%, which is very good. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2106.42s)]
*  Memphis is plus 4.7. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2109.86s)]
*  Minnesota's plus 4.5 and surging. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2111.82s)]
*  The Lakers are well below that. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2114.46s)]
*  They're at just plus 0.8, but they did remake their entire team in the most [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2116.34s)]
*  seismic trade in the history of the NBA. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2121.06s)]
*  Like not long ago, Denver's plus 4.1. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2122.7s)]
*  That's relatively close in Denver has the pedigree and the best player. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2125.42s)]
*  And so like, don't throw the record out because the record matters. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2129.18s)]
*  It's going to get them home court in a lot of rounds. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2134.14s)]
*  It can get them a higher seed and all that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2136.14s)]
*  But these teams are not that far apart, particularly the way Minnesota's [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2137.74s)]
*  trending Denver's trending. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2142.34s)]
*  We haven't mentioned the Warriors are plus 2.7, but they're obviously, I [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2143.66s)]
*  think 18 and five since they got Butler and neither Butler Steph missed three of [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2146.94s)]
*  those losses, so totally different team there too. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2150.66s)]
*  It's, it's just the top eight in the West of currently. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2153.18s)]
*  And if that's the playoff field, it's just one really good team after another. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2156.78s)]
*  Clippers are Clippers are plus 4.0 net rating. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2161.6600000000003s)]
*  They're not far away either. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2164.1000000000004s)]
*  Remarkably. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2165.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2167.1400000000003s)]
*  And the Clippers, you know, that they have a pretty easy schedule the rest of the way. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2167.34s)]
*  That's the other thing when I'm looking at this, where it's like, they're, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2174.26s)]
*  they're the eight seed, they play the Pelicans Wednesday. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2177.02s)]
*  They have back to backs at home against the Mavericks. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2180.5800000000004s)]
*  They play the Spurs Rockets at Sacramento and then at gold state to finish the [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2183.54s)]
*  season. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2188.7s)]
*  So I don't know if Kawhi's playing all those games, you know, could they run the [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2189.98s)]
*  slate and get into the four or five spot? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2194.66s)]
*  It's going to be, it's going to be so much fun to see who plays who. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2196.58s)]
*  And you know, I I'm obviously as a, as a long time Steph guy who just, who just [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2200.1s)]
*  enjoys watching and play basketball, especially in big playoff games. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2206.34s)]
*  It'd be fun to see him. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2209.22s)]
*  Denver Yokedge. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2210.58s)]
*  Are there any, are there any not Steph guys like Steph? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2211.54s)]
*  It's the opposite of like Waiters Island and you know, you were on research [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2214.7s)]
*  Island, like Steph is just like a planet. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2218.82s)]
*  There's, there's nobody that's not a Steph guy. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2221.22s)]
*  What happened with the arelitar on research Island? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2223.62s)]
*  Did you, did you look at anything? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2225.9s)]
*  I've liked research all season. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2227.66s)]
*  I have the, I have the text to Atlanta Hawks officials and coaches to prove it. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2229.02s)]
*  I'm like, this guy is good. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2232.3s)]
*  And now he's surging, but he just knows, look, is he going to be, is he the guy, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2233.22s)]
*  is he the dream number one pick when you win the lottery? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2237.82s)]
*  You know, maybe that guy's coming this year. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2240.54s)]
*  Maybe that guy's coming next year. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2242.06s)]
*  That guy came the year before, et cetera. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2243.2599999999998s)]
*  But it was very clear right away. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2245.42s)]
*  The guy knows how to play basketball and he's big and he's a decent athlete and [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2247.38s)]
*  he's smart and he does a lot of things pretty well. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2250.9s)]
*  And now he's coming along and you know, you'd have Hawks fans saying, wait, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2252.82s)]
*  Hey, wait a second. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2256.82s)]
*  You'd you'd have Hawks fans saying, Hey, wait a second. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2257.94s)]
*  Don't give rookie of the year to, to castle quite yet. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2260.18s)]
*  Our guys making a push on a team that actually semi matters this year. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2262.5s)]
*  I think that's fair to answer your Steph question. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2266.98s)]
*  I think there was some, there was some Levant LeBron versus Steph stuff. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2270.06s)]
*  And then in the late 2010s were the two fan bases got a little frisky about [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2275.54s)]
*  pushing their guy at the expense of the other guy, but it feels like that's done. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2281.5s)]
*  You know, and I think, I think all of these dudes, LeBron has a different thing. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2285.14s)]
*  Cause he's battling the ghosts of Kobe and MJ. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2288.94s)]
*  He's in like two totally different conversations, Kobe with the Laker [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2291.18s)]
*  fans and then Jordan with everybody else. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2294.66s)]
*  Curry's like, I just think he's, he's in that place where it's like, yeah, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2297.7000000000003s)]
*  it'd be really cool if we got to watch it play. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2301.6600000000003s)]
*  Yoke-age same way. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2303.26s)]
*  Be cool if we got Yoke-age for a couple of rounds. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2304.94s)]
*  Lakers. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2307.06s)]
*  Hey, we get Luke and LeBron for a couple of rounds. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2307.86s)]
*  Uh, no matter how it plays out, it's going to be fun. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2310.38s)]

*  And it was like that 10 years ago. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2392.1400000000003s)]
*  I've no, I must've been so frightened to be appearing on television with my bad [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2394.46s)]
*  shoes and my baggy suits back then that I just was just blocked the whole thing [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2399.94s)]
*  out. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2404.34s)]
*  Well, I remember I had to basically bully you to come on the show. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2404.86s)]
*  I had to bully you into doing a podcast and I had to bully you into coming on [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2407.7400000000002s)]
*  the TV show. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2411.26s)]
*  Do you just like, I just want to write, I just want to, I just want to do my [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2411.9s)]
*  thing. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2415.14s)]
*  I don't, I don't want any of this. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2415.54s)]
*  Um, 25 most intriguing players was the gimmick. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2418.1800000000003s)]
*  We are tweaking it this time, borrowing a little bit from fantasy's movie draft [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2422.2200000000003s)]
*  where it's not really a draft, but it's like categories and you have to pick one [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2427.82s)]
*  thing for each category. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2431.2200000000003s)]
*  So we created a bunch of categories. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2432.86s)]
*  We each only get one person in the categories. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2435.3s)]
*  It's not a one through 25, but you can pick the guy you want and put them in the [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2440.26s)]
*  category and then you get to talk about them. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2443.98s)]
*  And then that guy is off the board and you can't, we can't pick a guy for two [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2446.3s)]
*  categories. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2449.82s)]
*  You cannot. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2450.5800000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2451.46s)]
*  Now, did I already screw you up? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2453.0200000000004s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm good. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2454.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2455.3s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2455.5800000000004s)]
*  I just wanted clarity. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2455.9s)]
*  That makes it harder. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2457.0200000000004s)]
*  Here are the categories in alphabetical order. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2458.38s)]
*  Apex superstar, beloved bench guy, crossroads guy. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2461.98s)]
*  So that can be, is he in a post-season's crossroads? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2468.7400000000002s)]
*  Is he in a crossroads in his career? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2472.58s)]
*  Is he in a crossroads with his team? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2474.54s)]
*  He's in some sort of crossroads. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2476.14s)]
*  Defensive stud, feel good star, hot seat coach, hot seat player, legacy guy, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2478.26s)]
*  because you know, everybody loves a good legacy conversation. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2489.58s)]
*  Got to have it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2492.3s)]
*  Second banana, third banana, the leap, trade machine guy and weak link. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2493.46s)]
*  Did we put that one in there? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2504.14s)]
*  I'm at a surprise. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2505.46s)]
*  That's a surprise. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2506.58s)]
*  Surprise category. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2507.34s)]
*  Weak link. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2508.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2508.7799999999997s)]
*  That's a surprise category. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2508.94s)]
*  So we're probably gonna have more than 25. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2510.5s)]
*  I'm going to give you the first pick on, uh, on your comeback pod. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2512.82s)]
*  You can have a look at that. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2516.7799999999997s)]
*  On your comeback pod, you can have any player for any category. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2517.98s)]
*  Who you take any player for any category. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2520.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2524.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2525.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to go a second banana and I'm going to cheat right away [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2525.6200000000003s)]
*  and pick two guys, a duo together. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2530.94s)]
*  If you want to take it to, you're already bending the rules. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2533.94s)]
*  We just started. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2536.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2537.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm bending the rules. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2537.42s)]
*  You can, you can make it one if you want, depending on the two guys I'm going to [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2538.1s)]
*  mention, um, but I am going to start with Jalen Williams and Shet Holmgren as the [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2541.34s)]
*  number two and three guys on the Oklahoma city thunder. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2546.5s)]
*  Um, they underperformed against Dallas in last season's playoffs. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2549.62s)]
*  When the going got tough, they couldn't make enough shots. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2553.54s)]
*  Check. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2555.62s)]
*  Couldn't make enough threes. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2555.86s)]
*  Jalen couldn't just score enough points. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2556.82s)]
*  The non-Shea offense fell apart against the Mavericks. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2558.78s)]
*  Obviously this is a different team. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2563.34s)]
*  It's a deeper team. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2564.86s)]
*  It's a better team. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2565.94s)]
*  Aaron Wiggins has made a leap. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2567.1s)]
*  Isaiah Joe is better. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2568.38s)]
*  The Hartenstein Holmgren combo is mauling people. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2570.06s)]
*  They have different optionality. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2572.78s)]
*  They have Caruso coming off the bench. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2574.02s)]
*  Shea is better. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2575.66s)]
*  Jaydub is better. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2576.5s)]
*  Chad, they're all better. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2577.2999999999997s)]
*  At some point, like I think they're number two or number three in [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2578.94s)]
*  offense in the NBA. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2582.62s)]
*  Shea is likely going to win the MVP having one of the greatest scoring [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2583.8599999999997s)]
*  seasons of all time. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2587.2599999999998s)]
*  If you can take care of the ball against them. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2589.8199999999997s)]
*  And I realized nobody can there. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2592.58s)]
*  They are remarkably, I wonder how many teams have done this. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2594.54s)]
*  They're number one in forcing turnovers on defense and number one in not [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2597.18s)]
*  turning the ball over on offense. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2601.54s)]
*  It's like they start every game ahead 10 zero. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2603.22s)]
*  Just because of turnovers. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2605.66s)]
*  But if they run into a low turnover team, like the Mavericks with Luca, where [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2606.98s)]
*  the entire time Luca was there before they inexplicably traded him this year. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2610.5s)]
*  They might have a game or two when their offense in the half court comes into [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2614.94s)]
*  some moments of like, huh, like they're not making threes. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2619.8599999999997s)]
*  Dort Dort has an 0 for 8 game, you know, whatever, even though he [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2623.42s)]
*  shot 40% this season. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2626.8599999999997s)]
*  Shea is on the bench. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2628.74s)]
*  Like are those guys ready? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2630.14s)]
*  All the evidence. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2632.74s)]
*  Like I pick my pick and I have, I haven't had a podcast this year. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2633.54s)]
*  I pick Celtics over Thunder in the finals at the beginning of the season. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2637.2599999999998s)]
*  That's on Twitter. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2640.34s)]
*  I have never wavered from that now for one second. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2641.38s)]
*  So don't take this as a shot at the Thunder, but there's just going to be a [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2643.86s)]
*  moment where it's game three of a one, one series and the offense is like a [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2646.94s)]
*  little clogged and can those guys, can those pick one of them, whether it's [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2650.34s)]
*  Chet rolling to the rim as the five or shooting threes or J Dub just running [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2654.98s)]
*  things or whatever, um, one of them is going to have to have a moment where [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2658.5s)]
*  they rise up and I think they're ready for it. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2663.1s)]
*  I'll allow the combo pick. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2667.14s)]
*  I don't like that you cheated coming out of the gate, but we'll allow it. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2669.06s)]
*  Well, who's the second, who do you even call the second banana? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2672.42s)]
*  I guess offensively it's Jalen Williams. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2674.74s)]
*  Then if you want to take one and we're talking offense, it's Jalen Williams. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2676.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a double banana situation. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2681.38s)]
*  I think, I think you might be right, but it is, it's the thing I worry about [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2684.46s)]
*  with OKC and it's the thing as I think about the Celtics making the finals and [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2690.22s)]
*  playing them and what, how, what they're going to do against OKC and how they're [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2694.5s)]
*  going to try to beat them, I would assume all of it is going to be about making [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2697.9399999999996s)]
*  Shay give up the ball, sending multiple guys at him and making Jalen Williams [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2702.66s)]
*  or Chet play four and three or heart and Stein. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2707.18s)]
*  Now the OKC with the heart and Stein piece of it, cause he's always been really [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2710.1s)]
*  good at the foul line and he's always been good in those four and three [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2713.66s)]
*  situations, so when he's out there, it gets tougher. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2716.22s)]
*  But I still feel like, Hey, Jalen Williams, can you beat us? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2719.1800000000003s)]
*  Is going to be a strategy. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2723.26s)]
*  Well, Chet's a little different because Chet always gets his points in the flow. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2725.38s)]
*  They're not like, Oh, let's run our three chip plays, but Jalen Williams, they [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2728.98s)]
*  need, they need to beat guys off the dribble and a little pull up from 15 feet. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2732.1800000000003s)]
*  And he's really good, but that's a different spotlight. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2736.82s)]
*  And we haven't seen it. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2739.86s)]
*  We didn't see it in the NBA cup. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2740.82s)]
*  We didn't see it last year in the playoffs. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2742.42s)]
*  We just haven't seen him do it on a big stage yet. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2743.86s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned the NBA cup because we talked about this in LA. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2746.1s)]
*  Somebody else mentioned the NBA cup to me 10 days ago. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2750.74s)]
*  And I was like, that happened this year. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2754.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2757.2999999999997s)]
*  Who won that again? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2758.7s)]
*  And I'm like, it's a bad sign that someone who lives in Breeze, the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2760.1s)]
*  NBA has zero memory. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2764.46s)]
*  It took me a second, about minute 30 seconds to remember exactly who was in [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2767.2999999999997s)]
*  the final four and what happened. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2772.14s)]
*  And I don't care at all that the Milwaukee bucks won the NBA cup. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2773.98s)]
*  It does not matter to me. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2778.94s)]
*  I don't think it really matters to the bucks. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2781.1s)]
*  Like, I don't know how to, it's a, I guess it's cool. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2783.18s)]
*  The courts are fun, but I, it, do you care? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2786.94s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2790.06s)]
*  I think the problem with the NBA cup is it was cool as it was happening, but [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2791.8599999999997s)]
*  now we have two years in the bank and it's meaningless. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2795.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2799.7799999999997s)]
*  The playoffs coming. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2799.9s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is the real, the real stuff is about to start. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2800.7400000000002s)]
*  Like the bucks don't even have remotely the same team anymore. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2803.06s)]
*  They've, you know, they're, they're keeping their fingers crossed on [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2807.42s)]
*  Kyle Kuzma corner threes. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2811.06s)]
*  They don't know when Dame's coming back. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2812.5s)]
*  They're a team that's going in the wrong direction and it doesn't matter [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2814.02s)]
*  that they won the NBA cup. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2816.9s)]
*  I don't know how to fix that. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2817.94s)]
*  So Chet, Chet Hartenstein, the numbers on those two, which is obviously the [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2818.86s)]
*  mid-season curve ball they threw at the league when, when Chet finally got [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2822.62s)]
*  healthy after Hartenstein missed the beginning of the season. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2825.58s)]
*  Plus 15 per 100 possessions, elite offense, elite defense, elite rebounding [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2828.66s)]
*  Hartenstein's passing and floater have fit in about as well as could [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2833.5s)]
*  possibly have been expected. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2837.54s)]
*  And it's just another, it's not a curve ball. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2839.62s)]
*  It's the way they, they start games and it's worked. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2842.62s)]
*  It's worked that well. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2845.3399999999997s)]
*  And I just, one of the things I love about the thunder and I wish I'd been [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2846.62s)]
*  at a podcast to talk about it is there's something old school about it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2849.8199999999997s)]
*  Again, they're your second or third or fourth in offense or whatever. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2855.26s)]
*  So it's not like they're not an amazing offensive team. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2858.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2861.18s)]
*  I just love the fact that in this, like, are there too many points? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2861.46s)]
*  Is scoring too easy? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2864.5s)]
*  Are there too many threes? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2866.22s)]
*  The team at the top of the standings is like, you know what? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2867.7s)]
*  We are going to win first and foremost because we are a historically great [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2871.26s)]
*  defensive team that is going to take the ball from you a lot of times. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2876.22s)]
*  And we're not taking the ball from you. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2880.34s)]
*  We're going to be all up in your shit all over the floor, deflections, steals, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2882.1400000000003s)]
*  physicality, size, everything. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2886.46s)]
*  And when our offense sputters, that was the old, that was the way the NBA used [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2889.46s)]
*  to be like, Oh, your jumpers comes, go defense travels, defense shows up to [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2893.1s)]
*  every game and that the thunder have that element to it. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2896.3s)]
*  And I love how, how intense they are, how proud they are, how they do not relent [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2898.6200000000003s)]
*  at all, and they're betting more than anything else on, Hey, yeah, even if [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2904.1400000000003s)]
*  worst case scenario happens to our offense, good luck scoring on us [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2907.94s)]
*  more than we score on you. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2911.6600000000003s)]
*  It's the nightmare scenario for the Lakers. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2913.6600000000003s)]
*  And I am in the camp of don't get sucked into, Oh, the Lakers expertise, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2916.98s)]
*  veteran, like two scorers. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2920.82s)]
*  This is the kind of team like when I, when I saw OKC on Sunday night, play [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2922.34s)]
*  the Clippers and they were missing a couple of guys, so they had to play [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2926.94s)]
*  Dorton, Caruso and Wallace together. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2930.54s)]
*  And it was like, Jesus Christ, this is the most terrifying perimeter [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2933.5s)]
*  defense I've ever seen in my life. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2936.9s)]
*  Those three together, they have all these looks. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2939.42s)]
*  I think the Celtics are the same way where the Celtics can, because of poor [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2941.5s)]
*  Zingas and Horford, and then they can have like the, all of a sudden there's [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2945.46s)]
*  four white guys out there and all of them can shoot, all of a sudden they're [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2950.06s)]
*  playing double bigs, all of a sudden Tatum is playing stretch five. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2952.62s)]
*  Like they have different looks, but the OKC, the wrinkles they have to me are [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2956.06s)]
*  the second biggest reason that you're going to pick them to win the NBA title. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2962.26s)]
*  If you're going to pick them and I'm about to give you the number one reason. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2966.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2968.8599999999997s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2969.1s)]
*  Do you, how does this draft work? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2969.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you now pick your second banana or do you go to any category anywhere you want? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2970.8599999999997s)]
*  I do whatever I want. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2973.98s)]
*  And it's your five years. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2975.1s)]
*  We just made up these rules 10 minutes ago. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2975.58s)]
*  I'm going to the Apex superstar category and I'm taking SGA because, um, you know, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2977.9399999999996s)]
*  we have a weekend Aflap and Jokic who's one of my favorite players, non-Celtics [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2988.14s)]
*  probably ever having the best statistical season he's ever had. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2993.42s)]
*  And I think he's carried a massive load. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=2998.3s)]
*  And at this point, I still think I'm voting for SGA. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3000.86s)]
*  I mean, the odds, it's not, it's not a controversial pick. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3003.7000000000003s)]
*  The odds are way, way up there for them. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3006.42s)]
*  But the piece that's interesting to me, heading into the playoffs, it isn't [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3009.1s)]
*  just can OKC win the title. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3012.9s)]
*  Um, it isn't just can Sam Presti who's, you know, done a pretty incredible job [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3015.1800000000003s)]
*  for almost two decades here. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3020.38s)]
*  Is this all going to finally work out? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3021.98s)]
*  Are we in an 86 Celtics with also having the number two pick in the draft [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3024.1800000000003s)]
*  coming up scenario of, holy shit, not only is this the best team in the league, but [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3030.1000000000004s)]
*  they also have this asset and all of these young players and what the hell are [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3034.3s)]
*  we going to do there in that zone? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3037.7000000000003s)]
*  But for SGA, there's no zone by the way, no one's ever been in their zone. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3039.7000000000003s)]
*  There's never been a team this good now. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3043.1400000000003s)]
*  And this set up for the future. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3045.98s)]
*  I said this a year and a half to two years ago on this, on the low post [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3047.18s)]
*  podcast, which doesn't exist. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3050.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh, they are the best present plus future set up in the history of basketball. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3051.8599999999997s)]
*  And I don't know enough about the history of the other sports to say the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3057.1s)]
*  history of all professional sports. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3059.7799999999997s)]
*  I just have a hard time believing there's another convincing. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3061.1s)]
*  The only case is the Celts after they won the 86 title with bias coming for those [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3064.22s)]
*  48 hours before he tragically died, which we covered in Celtic city, uh, in episode [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3069.1s)]
*  five. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3074.06s)]
*  That's the only other thing I can think of where they went 67 and 15, they're [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3074.34s)]
*  50 and one at home. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3078.1400000000003s)]
*  They had a three time MVP and they were adding somebody who worst case scenario [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3079.6200000000003s)]
*  was going to be as good as, you know, in that Barkley Carl Malone thing. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3084.1000000000004s)]
*  That's the only thing I could think of. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3087.46s)]
*  Here's the case for SGA. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3089.02s)]
*  Why I took them here. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3090.2200000000003s)]
*  If they win the title and they just kick everybody's ass and they end up finishing. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3092.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3098.3s)]
*  Can they get to what's 69, 70 wins for the season? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3098.58s)]
*  And then the state ended up being like an 84, 85, 86 win team, which would put them [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3102.42s)]
*  on the short, short list with him at the lead on top of the fact that he's having [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3107.5800000000004s)]
*  one of the greatest offensive seasons in the history of the guard position. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3113.7000000000003s)]
*  Like it's, it's up there with any Oscar season. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3116.9s)]
*  I talked about this a couple of weeks ago, any Jordan season, any Kobe season, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3119.78s)]
*  like pick a great guard. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3124.1000000000004s)]
*  He's either doing better than one of their best seasons or he's right there. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3125.94s)]
*  And then if he just keeps that rolling through the playoffs and we finished mid [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3130.58s)]
*  June and we're like, Holy shit, the thunder just went 86 and 16 and SGA [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3134.7400000000002s)]
*  averaged 35 in the playoffs. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3140.3s)]
*  And this is now Michael Jordan. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3142.58s)]
*  Um, I think he's the most intriguing guy to me in the whole, in either conference. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3144.94s)]
*  I had him at stake. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3150.54s)]
*  I had him on my legacy list, um, for essentially all the same reasons, a [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3152.26s)]
*  chance to cement his place in not only the current NBA, but to begin cementing [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3157.2599999999998s)]
*  his place in NBA history with a dominant playoff run. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3162.66s)]
*  And, you know, I looked up his stats from the math series last year and they were [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3166.8199999999997s)]
*  way better than I remembered or would have guessed his scoring carried over into [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3172.66s)]
*  that series and his efficiency carried over into that series. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3176.22s)]
*  He's not an AA plus playmaker, like some of the other, you know, like [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3179.5s)]
*  Yokech, like Luca, like LeBron, but he's B plus a minus and he's gotten better. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3184.86s)]
*  And I think that series, the Maverick size, the way they clogged the lane on [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3190.98s)]
*  him, tested his playmaking and I don't think he was quite there yet as a [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3195.54s)]
*  playmaker and I don't think the thunder supporting cast and shooters were [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3199.58s)]
*  definitely not quite there yet. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3202.1400000000003s)]
*  I think they're there now and I don't see any reason. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3203.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, people talk about, you got to put size on him. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3207.6600000000003s)]
*  This guy's a good matchup for him. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3209.6600000000003s)]
*  You've talked about Tatum trying to guard him or Brown trying to guard him or [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3210.94s)]
*  Anthony Edwards trying to guard him. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3213.66s)]
*  Like no one has been able to really guard him. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3214.8999999999996s)]
*  And I don't see any reason that the scoring is going to, it might slow down a [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3217.54s)]
*  little bit just because the percentages are preposterous across the board. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3222.3799999999997s)]
*  I think the scoring is going to persist and I think the team around him is more [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3226.46s)]
*  ready and I think he's more, the other parts of his game are more ready. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3229.3799999999997s)]
*  And I think he's just unbelievable. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3232.18s)]
*  And I expected him to continue to be unbelievable in the playoffs. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3236.22s)]
*  I hate nobody's talking about these guys enough and nobody's [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3240.1s)]
*  giving these guys enough credit. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3243.34s)]
*  Um, converse talk conversation on talk shows. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3245.2200000000003s)]
*  Cause I feel like we've talked about, okay, see a lot all over the place. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3249.1000000000004s)]
*  It's just the way the infrastructure is going to go. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3253.5s)]
*  They're always going to talk about LeBron and the Lakers and the big ass [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3255.82s)]
*  teams a little bit more just how it goes. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3259.02s)]
*  Um, I actually think, well, like we haven't totally talked about how [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3261.46s)]
*  great SGA is as a score. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3266.86s)]
*  I feel like we're like a couple conversations, videos, breakdowns short [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3269.2200000000003s)]
*  because watching it in person and watching all the moves he has and watching [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3275.2200000000003s)]
*  the yo-yo shit he does and how helpless defenders are against him when they know [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3279.82s)]
*  what he's trying to do and how he can get to the rim, how he uses contact, how [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3283.82s)]
*  every team thinks he's getting all the calls and they're pissed off the whole [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3288.58s)]
*  game. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3291.46s)]
*  It's just, it's really a master performance. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3292.1800000000003s)]
*  It's he's really great. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3295.02s)]
*  And I think going against him in a finals is fucking terrifying no matter what [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3296.2599999999998s)]
*  round, but especially like for the Celtics and they have the perfect team to stop [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3301.9s)]
*  him, right? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3305.02s)]
*  They have wings with size, they have weight, they have holiday, they have rim [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3305.8599999999997s)]
*  protection with poor Zingas. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3309.8599999999997s)]
*  It's everything you'd want. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3311.22s)]
*  And I still think he'd get 35 a game against them. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3312.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think it matters. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3314.74s)]
*  I mean, I agree. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3317.22s)]
*  And, um, it's an art. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3320.22s)]
*  What he does is art. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3323.2599999999998s)]
*  It's beautiful to watch. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3324.46s)]
*  It's on the level of space he creates when you don't even realize that he's [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3325.5s)]
*  about to create it is just, um, he'll have five feet of open space and you're [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3330.02s)]
*  like, wait, did he even do a hard jab step? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3335.82s)]
*  Like what move was that that got that guy? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3337.78s)]
*  They were guarding him at mid court. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3339.26s)]
*  How did he create the space? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3340.62s)]
*  People are so afraid of him getting by them because he has a top gear that he [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3341.62s)]
*  doesn't use much because he doesn't have to use it much that he just a little [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3344.86s)]
*  glance forward guys are like jumping back and he's just pulling up for these [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3349.1s)]
*  wide open 18 footers. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3352.7s)]
*  And I think the reason, you know, people in the MVP argument, which thankfully I [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3354.38s)]
*  have not had to be a part of this year and hasn't been so ugly like it was the [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3358.6600000000003s)]
*  last couple of years either. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3362.34s)]
*  Um, you know, people will point to the defense and say, uh, you know, SGA is [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3363.82s)]
*  a plus defender. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3369.1400000000003s)]
*  Jokic is not. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3370.34s)]
*  Um, and I think that's largely been true this year. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3371.98s)]
*  Um, Jokic is rebounding and just positional smarts and hands at a position [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3376.1s)]
*  where defense really matters. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3381.9s)]
*  I think is a little bit underrated, but to me, the difference has been. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3383.62s)]
*  Teams game plan to attack Jokic. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3387.74s)]
*  Sometimes it works. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3390.2599999999998s)]
*  Sometimes it doesn't. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3391.22s)]
*  The nuggets are 20th and defense is not good enough this year. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3392.18s)]
*  We'll see if it tightens up in the playoffs. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3394.58s)]
*  Teams can game plan to attack Shay too, because there's just no one [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3396.86s)]
*  else to attack on Oklahoma city. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3399.98s)]
*  He's kind of like their Curry in that way, a better defensive player, obviously [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3401.66s)]
*  than Curry ever was, but there was a Curry was the weak link because every [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3405.42s)]
*  other link was as solid as a link could get on those peak warrior teams. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3408.7799999999997s)]
*  And the thunder aren't worried about it. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3413.1s)]
*  Like he's, he's big. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3414.42s)]
*  He's stronger than you think. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3415.9s)]
*  He blocks, he has more blocks and seals than Jokic combined. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3417.38s)]
*  It's not close. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3420.2999999999997s)]
*  And they are ideally positioned around him to tilt the floor toward [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3421.46s)]
*  him if he needs any help in there. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3424.9s)]
*  But they're, they're not, they don't have to sit in coaches meetings and think. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3426.1s)]
*  Well, what do we do when this team puts Shay in the pick and roll or [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3430.94s)]
*  when this guy targets Shay? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3433.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3435.18s)]
*  When Luca has him, it's going to be, you know, the size advantage is what it is, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3435.7s)]
*  but they don't have to sit there and think that hard about, oh, we got it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3438.86s)]
*  We got to scrap everything we're doing defensively because they're going to go [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3442.66s)]
*  at Shay this way or that way. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3445.7799999999997s)]
*  It's so funny how it's evolved. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3448.66s)]
*  Cause when I was going to see him as a rookie on the Clippers and it was like, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3450.18s)]
*  ah, this guy's kind of rondo-y. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3455.02s)]
*  I could see him like a, you know, a elite defensive player and a good playmaker. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3457.7s)]
*  Like he's really interesting player. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3462.58s)]
*  He's definitely going to be really good. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3464.66s)]
*  But this is like, he's one of the best guards I've ever seen in person ever. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3466.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't, I don't know how long that list is and I'll probably have to figure it [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3471.1000000000004s)]
*  out at some point, but it's, it's on the short list of the. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3473.98s)]
*  The best, most impactful guys. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3477.6200000000003s)]
*  Like the Cooper game I went to Sunday, he couldn't buy a shot. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3479.1400000000003s)]
*  It just was one of those, the ball was rolling around the rim. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3482.6600000000003s)]
*  The ball was hitting the back. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3485.1400000000003s)]
*  Like he was getting all the shots he wanted. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3486.1800000000003s)]
*  They just weren't going in and it was kind of shocking to watch. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3487.9s)]
*  I was like, Oh my God, did she's not getting bounces? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3490.9s)]
*  He always gets bounces anyway. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3494.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3496.1000000000004s)]
*  We're at, we're on a slow pace. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3496.42s)]
*  We've only done a two. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3497.78s)]
*  What's your next guy? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3499.34s)]
*  Uh, all right. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3501.26s)]
*  I'm going to go in the interest of leaving you some of the categories that are. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3502.6200000000003s)]
*  You don't have to leave me anything. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3508.46s)]
*  You try to destroy me. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3509.7000000000003s)]
*  Like, okay. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3511.1400000000003s)]
*  So he's going to try to destroy the Lakers. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3511.7400000000002s)]
*  I didn't know we were actually building a team. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3513.46s)]
*  Uh, I, I was, I feel like this guy qualifies as either one of the bananas, but [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3516.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll take him in the leap category on the other number one seed, uh, Evan [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3520.78s)]
*  Mobley in the playoffs. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3526.1s)]
*  Um, I just can't wait to see how this Cavs team looks in the playoffs on [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3528.06s)]
*  both ends of the floor. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3532.1s)]
*  I think their offense is number one with a bullet Mitchell has done enough in the [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3533.58s)]
*  playoff and I said a couple of dud playoff series, but he's also had like [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3538.54s)]
*  three or four, Oh my God, playoff series. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3541.74s)]
*  So like I trust him Garland. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3544.3399999999997s)]
*  I trust, I trust the offense largely despite the spacing concerns. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3546.3399999999997s)]
*  It's still, you know, theoretically exists playing two big guys together. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3549.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, defensively I'm, I'm very interested to see depending on the matchups and if [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3554.34s)]
*  they do get to Boston, how they match up in some of those series and where Mobley [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3559.38s)]
*  is on the floor and how, how does he have to guard Tatum? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3564.46s)]
*  Does he guard Brown? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3568.3s)]
*  He's guarded all these guys here and there, but how do they utilize him? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3569.1s)]
*  But I think the Evan Mobley thing is, is, I mean, even against the Celtics last [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3572.22s)]
*  year when Jalen, Jared Allen got hurt, he played center and all of a sudden [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3576.22s)]
*  everyone's like, Oh, he's got to play center. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3579.02s)]
*  This is how he looked amazing. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3580.3s)]
*  Rolling to the rim and dunking and he looks amazing now with the big to big [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3581.62s)]
*  passing, with the cutting, with just, Oh, you're going to put a wing on me. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3585.58s)]
*  I'm just going to dribble from 18 feet out and beat the hell out of them and hit a [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3589.3399999999997s)]
*  hook shot. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3592.7s)]
*  Um, I, I, I just, I, I would have him in Penn on second team, all NBA. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3593.7799999999997s)]
*  I actually thought about him for the fifth spot on first team, all NBA when [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3602.02s)]
*  Mitchell started slumping a little bit. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3606.1s)]
*  I think Mitchell has now popped out of that slump and reclaimed that spot, but [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3607.46s)]
*  that's how good, you know, and I heard you and Rossello talking about whether [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3611.38s)]
*  Anthony Edwards was coming from that spot. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3614.5s)]
*  And I was saying like, I think actually Mobley given he's averaging 21 a game, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3616.06s)]
*  what he does on defense, what he does as a playmaker has a case to be at least in [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3620.1400000000003s)]
*  that discussion, but I have him in Penn second team, all NBA. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3624.3s)]
*  And all that said, we S we've seen what happens to this team's offense in the [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3627.86s)]
*  playoffs. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3631.82s)]
*  It's a totally different offense, new coach Garland's healthy. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3632.1400000000003s)]
*  That was the most undersold thing in dumb NBA conversations going into the season [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3634.94s)]
*  is people just not remembering what a miserable season Darius Garland had [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3639.14s)]
*  health wise last season and what a difference in healthy Darius Garland was [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3643.18s)]
*  going to make. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3646.1s)]
*  Um, but there's going to be moments where the floor gets tight and a team really [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3647.22s)]
*  challenges them to, does your, like all your little fancy cutting stuff, which I [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3651.46s)]
*  think they've actually done a little less of lately when I've watched them. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3656.14s)]
*  All that's going to be scouted. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3659.14s)]
*  We're going to be totally dialed in on that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3660.2599999999998s)]
*  It's going to get harder and it's going to get harder in ways that tests have [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3661.8199999999997s)]
*  been mobile. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3665.7799999999997s)]
*  And this team reasonably now has championship expectations that don't [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3666.7000000000003s)]
*  ride only on him, but I think he is the biggest swing factor, uh, along with [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3672.46s)]
*  their, you know, how are they going to defend these big wings when they run [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3679.58s)]
*  into them? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3682.42s)]
*  Like it's Max Struce really the guy is Deandre Hunter really the guy that [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3682.78s)]
*  Deandre, by the way, did Deandre Hunter line up like Hunter in Struce's place [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3686.86s)]
*  and the other four starters has only played like 30 minutes. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3691.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm actually surprised how little they've used that lineup. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3694.06s)]
*  If they're saving it, I don't know. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3696.54s)]
*  I just think they like, they've been number one seed for like a month. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3698.94s)]
*  I don't really understand why their defense went sideways. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3701.58s)]
*  I'm with you on Mowgli. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3704.7s)]
*  There's going to be, I think he's their most important guy in a Celtic series. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3706.2999999999997s)]
*  More important than Mitchell, anyone else they have. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3711.62s)]
*  And there's going to be two or three times in that series where he has an open [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3713.58s)]
*  three in the last four minutes of a game they need, and I'm not sure if it's [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3716.7799999999997s)]
*  going to go in or not. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3720.86s)]
*  And it might and it might not, but that's going to be the thing. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3721.62s)]
*  If he's, if he's hitting threes and doing all the other stuff and looking like [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3723.9s)]
*  late nineties KG on top of the three point thing, then that, then they could [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3727.74s)]
*  win the title, but there's no question. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3731.9s)]
*  Is he, is he defensive? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3733.5s)]
*  Is he defensive player of the year? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3734.74s)]
*  I can't decide. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3736.02s)]
*  I don't have a ballot because I gave mine up last year. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3736.98s)]
*  And even if I wanted to get it back, I don't think they give them to unemployed [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3739.42s)]
*  people, but you're employed, but now I am. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3742.2999999999997s)]
*  But we'll get you a ballot. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3745.7s)]
*  I can't decide. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3748.22s)]
*  I can't decide. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3749.54s)]
*  I'm starting to buy into the Dremond self-created hype for defensive player of [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3750.2599999999998s)]
*  the year, because he has been spectacular the entire year, Jaren Jackson Jr. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3754.98s)]
*  has missed some games and still gets into foul trouble. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3758.58s)]
*  Like once every three games, they just have to take them out constantly. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3760.58s)]
*  Cause he's in foul trouble. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3763.02s)]
*  And obviously Wemby, Wemby is not eligible. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3764.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, I'm going to continue that conversation with my next pick. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3768.94s)]
*  Cause I have some thoughts. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3773.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3775.34s)]
*  I'm going to grab in the defensive stud category. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3775.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3778.8199999999997s)]
*  Lou Dort. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3779.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3781.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3782.18s)]
*  I haven't done all my defensive player of the year work and I'm not going to say, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3785.14s)]
*  I think it should be this guy. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3789.8199999999997s)]
*  I really want to like study it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3791.1s)]
*  Cause I think it's really interesting that there's no clear cut guy. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3792.4599999999996s)]
*  I'll just say this Lou Dort is the best defensive player I've watched this season [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3796.9799999999996s)]
*  in multiple games and I've been shocked by some of the shit he's done. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3800.8599999999997s)]
*  It's possible he's never made an all defense team. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3804.18s)]
*  And if that's the case, that's going to change this year. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3806.7s)]
*  I, what he did to Jalen Brown and the game in Boston was like startling. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3809.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, and you know, we were arguing on Sunday's pod about how tall he is. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3813.8999999999996s)]
*  Cause I was watching him stand next to other dudes and I swear he looks like [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3818.1s)]
*  he's six, two, maybe he's like six, three, whatever he is, but he guards everybody. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3821.58s)]
*  And the thing with him that, you know, how good of a defensive player he is, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3825.94s)]
*  is like people, you know, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3830.02s)]
*  I mean, I think one of the, the things that I find hilarious is like people [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3833.5s)]
*  get actively bummed out when he's on them. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3835.66s)]
*  Like he, like he had a game, I think a week or two weeks ago when he just was like, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3838.46s)]
*  I'm just going to take out Desmond Bayne today, Desmond, payment one for 12. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3843.1s)]
*  He destroyed Brown in the Boston game. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3846.94s)]
*  I went to that quipper game and he could guard everybody on the Quippers. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3849.54s)]
*  I've been to two KC okay. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3853.3399999999997s)]
*  See quipper games where hardens just has this look like I, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3855.5s)]
*  This is the worst two and a half hours of my life. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3859.74s)]
*  All these dudes, but especially Dort. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3862.06s)]
*  And I just think, right. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3864.3799999999997s)]
*  I know Daniel's has been amazing and you know, so good hands, the [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3865.3799999999997s)]
*  steel, absolutely incredible checks, staff, let us says him. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3869.58s)]
*  He's won games with his defense. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3873.12s)]
*  I think I'd have him as a most improved player, by the way. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3875.0s)]
*  I know all the smart money is on Cade. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3877.4599999999996s)]
*  I think considering expectations and, and expectations and prior track record. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3879.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't, I don't think anyone's made a bigger leap than Dyson Daniels. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3887.02s)]
*  I mean, like, it's not surprising when he scores 20 points in a game and, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3890.78s)]
*  and also does what he does. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3894.5s)]
*  Dort is a great, is a great pick. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3896.1800000000003s)]
*  I think. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3898.7000000000003s)]
*  Can I, can I say one thing on Daniel's? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3899.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3901.3s)]
*  Cause I completely agree. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3901.46s)]
*  So, right. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3902.86s)]
*  And obviously not a lot of bet on the awards. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3903.38s)]
*  I always want to mention that, but I always look to see like, am I missing something? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3905.5s)]
*  Like Dort was 26 to one last week. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3909.5s)]
*  And I'm like, I, I haven't done all my work yet, but if, if you just put a gun in my [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3912.6600000000003s)]
*  head right now and said, pick an offensive player of the year, I think I'd pick Dort [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3918.06s)]
*  cause he was the best defender I've seen. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3920.98s)]
*  I felt the same way about Daniel's. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3923.2200000000003s)]
*  I thought he was going to be favored for most improved player, but it's Cade. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3924.5800000000004s)]
*  Daniel's is plus one 10. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3928.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm not shocked that Cade's better. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3930.26s)]
*  Like he was the number one pick in the draft and he's has a better coach and [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3932.02s)]
*  whatever Daniel's was, uh, you know, thrown into the Dejante Murray trade. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3935.54s)]
*  Basically, you know, he was one of the prizes, but it wasn't like, Oh my God, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3941.02s)]
*  they traded Dyson Daniels. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3945.94s)]
*  It was like, I don't know what that guy is. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3947.54s)]
*  And now you watch him and he's like an absolute keeper. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3949.46s)]
*  And I don't know why he wouldn't be the most improved player of the year. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3953.02s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3955.3s)]
*  So the, the incredible thing about Oklahoma city's defense is. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3956.14s)]
*  Dort is going to be there. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3961.5s)]
*  All defense representative. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3963.82s)]
*  I actually think I would have Jalen Williams on as well. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3965.22s)]
*  I think I would have two thunder players on as well. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3967.58s)]
*  They missed them. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3969.5s)]
*  That quipper game I went to not having him on Kawhi. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3970.06s)]
*  You could feel the difference. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3972.66s)]
*  Cause that's six, eight type of guy. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3974.06s)]
*  You can look at a lot of the metrics who will, and the metrics will tell you the [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3975.86s)]
*  thunder have three better defensive players on their roster than those two guys. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3980.2999999999997s)]
*  And none of the three Hartenstein, Holmgren and Caruso are eligible for awards [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3984.82s)]
*  because of games played and minutes played. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3989.98s)]
*  But the statistics scream out that those guys would be in this conversation too. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3992.1s)]
*  And it's like, Oh my God, how many, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3996.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, you mentioned Wallace. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3997.82s)]
*  And Wallace said, Wallace is another one. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=3999.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4001.58s)]
*  Wallace is another one. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4001.94s)]
*  Wallace is like he and Jalen Williams. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4002.7799999999997s)]
*  You don't see a lot of guys who will just, I'm just going to swipe at the ball [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4005.54s)]
*  constantly because I can do it without fouling you and they just, when they're [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4010.74s)]
*  in the mood or whatever, they're just like, I'm going to go for every, every time [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4017.18s)]
*  you drill the ball, I'm going to try to get the ball from you and it's unnerving. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4020.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4024.82s)]
*  It's, this is why, you know, sometimes this happens. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4025.22s)]
*  We have to pick a player and it's probably not Lou Dort, but whatever OKC [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4028.58s)]
*  is doing defensively, it almost needs like, you need like a defensive players [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4033.42s)]
*  of the year award just to capture the fucking havoc and they start immediately. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4036.86s)]
*  And the teams, you can see it in their faces. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4041.54s)]
*  We're really like, Oh my God, this really, you're going to defend me 90 feet. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4043.58s)]
*  Yeah, we are actually, we're going to make your life miserable for two and a half [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4048.06s)]
*  hours and then Wallace is going to go out and Caruso is going to come in. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4051.02s)]
*  Oh, Hey, how about we're going to throw some blue door down you. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4054.86s)]
*  That team's a nightmare. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4057.46s)]
*  Make your next pick. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4058.46s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4059.98s)]
*  I'm going to go, um, I'm going to go. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4061.1800000000003s)]
*  Crossroads player. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4066.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4068.1000000000004s)]
*  And I'm going to go with Carl Anthony towns. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4070.38s)]
*  Ah, he was on my list. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4072.6600000000003s)]
*  Now to some degree, I think towns cross the crossroads, so to speak. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4074.86s)]
*  Did he last year in the Denver series. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4080.86s)]
*  And I even wrote about it on ESPN about, you know, all of a sudden the [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4083.5s)]
*  turnovers were down, the fouls were down. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4088.82s)]
*  There was a calmness and a steadiness to his game that combined with his shot [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4092.1800000000003s)]
*  making were like, okay, this is the guy that we've seen in the regular season. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4095.94s)]
*  And this is the guy we've been waiting for. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4102.14s)]
*  He guarded Durant really well considering the, the sort of stylistic differences [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4103.62s)]
*  between them in the first round with Minnesota beat the hell out of Phoenix. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4109.18s)]
*  Despite Phoenix having a roster that only three teams in the NBA wouldn't [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4112.66s)]
*  trade for or wouldn't trade with according to Matt Ischbier. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4116.58s)]
*  You love that. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4119.58s)]
*  Uh, I do. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4120.66s)]
*  Uh, and then he sputtered again against the Mavs in the conference finals. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4121.7s)]
*  Then he averaged 19 points. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4125.18s)]
*  He shot poorly. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4126.3s)]
*  Um, and then he gets traded in this just massive total shift of his life from. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4127.66s)]
*  He, he found a way to thrive next to a real behemoth center and Rudy go bear [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4133.58s)]
*  who could do all the dirty work on defense around the rim that he's not very good at. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4138.94s)]
*  And now he is a, almost a full-time center now for the Knicks who are living [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4142.98s)]
*  the benefits of that on offense and feeling the pain of it on defense. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4148.78s)]
*  And Mitchell Robinson just hasn't played enough minutes yet that we can see [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4153.3s)]
*  sort of how that pairing works. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4156.18s)]
*  And I'm actually surprised Tibbs has not used it much, even when Mitchell [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4157.58s)]
*  Robinson has been available for 15, 18 minutes a game, I thought they'd, we'd [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4160.26s)]
*  see more of it just to see, can we replicate some of what happened in [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4163.46s)]
*  Minnesota, even if that means like a little bit less of one of the core wing [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4167.66s)]
*  guys who have all been good to great for the Knicks this year, Brunson's got to [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4171.98s)]
*  get healthy. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4176.58s)]
*  Uh, we all know that the team is dead in the water without him. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4177.9s)]
*  They're a spectacular offensive team in Brunson's absence. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4183.339999999999s)]
*  You would have, you've talked a lot about this. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4188.0199999999995s)]
*  I've talked a lot about this with people behind the scenes this year. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4189.7s)]
*  They weren't using bridges enough. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4192.7s)]
*  You don't trade all that stuff for bridges. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4194.66s)]
*  If you're not going to lean into him as a secondary ball handler, even when he's [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4196.78s)]
*  the third, fourth or fifth best guy on the floor, he has that skillset that you [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4200.78s)]
*  should swing the ball for him to do. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4205.099999999999s)]
*  Hey, do a inverted McHale bridges, Jalen Brunson pick and roll swing into a [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4207.139999999999s)]
*  McHale bridges towns pick and roll. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4211.5s)]
*  Just involve him more. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4212.74s)]
*  Now they've had to he's thrived. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4214.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4217.179999999999s)]
*  Well, who could have believed that a guy he used to average 23, 24 a game would [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4217.42s)]
*  actually know what to do if you ran a play for him. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4221.62s)]
*  And he's even gotten to the free throw line a little bit. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4223.74s)]
*  He's averaging like three and a half, three free throws a game since Brunson [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4226.0599999999995s)]
*  went out, which feels like an avalanche compared to the almost zero he was [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4228.94s)]
*  averaging before that. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4232.299999999999s)]
*  Um, but I do think they've been almost written off, I think is a real threat to [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4234.0599999999995s)]
*  Cleveland and Boston is a different story. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4241.179999999999s)]
*  Boston is a nightmare matchup for them. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4243.259999999999s)]
*  Um, I think the Knicks are better than I've, I I I'm higher on this team than [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4245.7s)]
*  consensus, despite the obvious limitations of towns in the middle. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4250.5s)]
*  I think they were the biggest threat to Boston last season. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4254.54s)]
*  Obviously they've completely remade their team since then. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4257.34s)]
*  Um, now they might have a very interesting first round. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4260.66s)]
*  They will have a very interesting first round series either against an upstart [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4264.34s)]
*  Pistons team, or maybe even the remnants of the bucks. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4267.06s)]
*  Um, I think there's a great team in here somewhere, even as is. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4270.14s)]
*  And a lot of that has to do with towns finding a way to still contribute on [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4277.06s)]
*  offense when teams do what they're going to do, which is put wings on him and put [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4282.62s)]
*  their centers on Josh Hart and his production in those scenarios has been [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4287.22s)]
*  uneven and just can he do enough defensively to survive with all the help [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4291.02s)]
*  around him? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4296.54s)]
*  You could argue he, he crossed the crossroads last year. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4297.7s)]
*  He kind of did, but this is a new team, new setting, new expectations, um, as [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4300.18s)]
*  good or better, I think that the Minnesota team he was on last year. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4305.62s)]
*  And I just, you know, let's, let's see how it looks and is the Robinson thing [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4309.18s)]
*  still a wild card that we could see a little bit more of in the playoffs or [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4313.9400000000005s)]
*  is that, is it just too late for that? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4317.1s)]
*  I'm curious about that too. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4318.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4321.18s)]
*  I'm not banking on Mitchell Robinson. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4321.38s)]
*  No, you can't. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4322.860000000001s)]
*  Um, Celtics are a nightmare matchup for towns. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4324.3s)]
*  There's so many different ways to attack him. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4328.900000000001s)]
*  Wasn't that, wasn't that opening night? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4331.34s)]
*  And it was just like, this is a, the Celtics, I think it was opening night [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4332.58s)]
*  and Missoula came out with a game plan that was like game one of a playoff [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4335.700000000001s)]
*  series Celtics in the Knicks. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4339.06s)]
*  Just let's exploit every advantage we have, including over towns. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4340.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4344.54s)]
*  It's been interesting because there's been some Celtic games where they haven't [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4344.7s)]
*  wanted to tip anything at all. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4347.78s)]
*  And then there's been other games when they've tried to send a message. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4349.74s)]
*  And that was one of the messages. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4352.38s)]
*  I like the town's pick. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4353.62s)]
*  I don't really know what he is, but this is going to be the best version ever of it. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4355.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4358.62s)]
*  He's never going to be better than he is this year. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4358.98s)]
*  He's never going to be in a better situation as a stretch five slash [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4361.139999999999s)]
*  flimsy rim protector on a really good team. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4365.139999999999s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4368.0599999999995s)]
*  I, I actually have been shocked by how well that trade worked out. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4369.26s)]
*  I think if you had told me what's going to be a disaster, Paul George on the [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4373.34s)]
*  Sixers or towns on the Knicks and had like a betting line on it, I would have [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4377.74s)]
*  said minus one 60 Paul George, but I think there would have been some towns action. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4382.46s)]
*  And you think it's surprising that it was so it's, it got to Paul George has to [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4388.62s)]
*  cancel his podcast. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4393.46s)]
*  It's so bad. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4394.74s)]
*  Levels of disaster. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4395.5s)]
*  What are we going to do with that podcast P? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4396.38s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4398.66s)]
*  Well, man, there's a lot of good picks left. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4401.58s)]
*  What's a, what's good legacy guy for my next pick. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4404.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4414.54s)]
*  Um, and some good legacies on the line here on the line, some good legacies on [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4415.54s)]
*  the line. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4423.62s)]
*  There's like, it'd be a lot of legacy talk. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4424.18s)]
*  If he doesn't show up in the playoffs, his legacy is tarnished forever. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4425.66s)]
*  This is it. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4429.7s)]
*  He has to come through tonight. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4430.58s)]
*  I think the Tatum legacy case is by far the most interesting of all the [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4435.1s)]
*  legacies, except for the Laker guys. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4438.62s)]
*  And I don't want to take the Laker guys. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4440.62s)]
*  I'll, I'll leave them to you. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4442.0199999999995s)]
*  The Tatum thing coming back from last year where he doesn't win either award. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4443.74s)]
*  And then, um, he goes to the Olympics, misses the first two practices, just had [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4447.66s)]
*  a kid ends up not playing buried on the bench and then his transformation this [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4453.62s)]
*  year. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4459.02s)]
*  And if he actually comes through it, it'll be much tougher playoff competition [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4459.9400000000005s)]
*  this year and becomes the guy that we've been watching the last couple of months. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4463.46s)]
*  I think there's a real edge to him. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4468.18s)]
*  Um, I've been so impressed. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4470.26s)]
*  Look, I know the Celtics have been locked in two seed forever. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4472.42s)]
*  I've been so impressed with how they've looked the last month or so. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4474.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, and I know when teams get locked into playoff spots, they have a tendency [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4479.22s)]
*  to drift one way or another, or you have, you can have a tendency to overreact [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4484.26s)]
*  to what you're seeing. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4487.46s)]
*  I'm seeing a really mentally tough team. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4488.860000000001s)]
*  And I think Missoula is fanatical about, um, this whole season about what it's [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4491.3s)]
*  like to defend a title, what it takes, what kind of mental edge you need, how [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4496.900000000001s)]
*  you have to have a bullseye, how you have to have a chip on your shoulder. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4501.3s)]
*  I think he's been motivated them a lot. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4504.42s)]
*  I think he's been really challenging them. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4506.46s)]
*  And Tatum has been the guy that he's challenged the most and Tatum does the [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4508.740000000001s)]
*  most, and now he's in a situation where if they win the title, this is no one [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4512.700000000001s)]
*  A one B situation anymore. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4518.06s)]
*  He's the best guy in this team and he's one of the best three to four guys in [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4519.42s)]
*  the league. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4522.700000000001s)]
*  Well, they win the title. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4524.02s)]
*  Did you waiver from he's the best guy on the team at any point? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4525.700000000001s)]
*  I know Jalen Brown, one finals. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4528.34s)]
*  I'm just saying there was like one A one B stuff last year with those guys. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4529.580000000001s)]
*  They were a pairing. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4532.780000000001s)]
*  They're not really a pairing anymore. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4533.54s)]
*  He's the best guy in the team. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4534.900000000001s)]
*  And if he rips through and they went back to back and he's by far the best [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4537.06s)]
*  guy, now it's a different conversation about where he is career wise, where he [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4541.02s)]
*  is historically people start looking at his decade, the all MBAs, all the [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4546.66s)]
*  playoffs, and there's some real, there's some real great stuff sitting for him [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4550.98s)]
*  now. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4555.26s)]
*  So I just wanted to, uh, just wanted to capture the moment there, Zach. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4555.42s)]
*  He was number one on my legacy, uh, on my list of guys to potentially take for [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4558.98s)]
*  this category, just because. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4563.46s)]
*  If you are the best player and you win finals MVP and you break the no repeat [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4567.18s)]
*  streak that the NBA is in right now, and you do it emphatically, um, you become a [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4574.82s)]
*  two-time champion, a back-to-back champion on the Boston Celtics. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4581.099999999999s)]
*  I think you, you catapult up into different historical kinds of conversations. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4585.86s)]
*  Um, I think he's going to get there anyway, cause he's still so, you know, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4591.38s)]
*  he's right in the meat of his prime of his career has so many years left his [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4594.38s)]
*  career numbers. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4597.299999999999s)]
*  If he stays healthy are going to be outrageous across the board. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4597.94s)]
*  He's just become a better all around player year to year, every year in every [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4602.14s)]
*  possible way, six assists a game. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4608.1s)]
*  This season's career eyes defense is always good. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4609.94s)]
*  You never asked, asked, asked Jason Tatum to play hard on defense, to play smart on [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4612.18s)]
*  defense, to take tough matchups, to guard up in size, to do whatever the team needs [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4616.1s)]
*  him to do. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4619.62s)]
*  Um, he's just an awesome player and. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4620.98s)]
*  You know, you don't win the title without being mentally tough. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4624.66s)]
*  They are mentally tough. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4628.34s)]
*  I think there's been periods of this season where their offenses has not, I [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4629.46s)]
*  mean, Ryan, I've heard him call it hunt happy, where they just kind of settle [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4634.38s)]
*  into old patterns and the patterns are effective, but you feel them just sort [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4638.02s)]
*  of just settling for the sake of settling. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4641.9s)]
*  When they don't do that, when they mix in the hunting of the small guys, which [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4644.42s)]
*  if they get a Halliburton or a Garland or whoever is going to be a huge part of [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4648.06s)]
*  every Brunson of every series that they could possibly be in a Dame, if not [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4651.58s)]
*  knock on wood Dame can get healthy. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4655.58s)]
*  Um, when they mix that in with, don't forget, you have a pick and pop big man. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4657.740000000001s)]
*  Don't forget. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4661.9800000000005s)]
*  We have all these other off ball actions that we can run. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4662.42s)]
*  They become very, very hard to guard and he's at the apex of all that. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4664.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4668.3s)]
*  There's a strength thing with him. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4668.5s)]
*  Remember like LeBron in the late two thousands when we were like, he's got to [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4670.02s)]
*  get stronger, he's got to start posting up people, he's got to be more physical. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4674.34s)]
*  And then there was some moment, probably when he got to Cleveland again, after [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4678.700000000001s)]
*  the Miami thing, where all of a sudden physically, he just seemed imposing. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4683.06s)]
*  And you could feel it and you could feel the shift and say, you can't guard [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4687.700000000001s)]
*  LeBron with that guy anymore. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4691.14s)]
*  A little of that's happening with Tatum when they try to put smaller guys on him. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4692.700000000001s)]
*  He's just, is bullying people and he's really strong now. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4695.9400000000005s)]
*  Uh, I've been really impressed. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4698.5s)]
*  I think he's, uh, I think he's checked every box for me. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4699.9400000000005s)]
*  I was worried last summer, you know, his three point shot was going sideways. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4702.820000000001s)]
*  He's benched to the Olympics. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4706.54s)]
*  It was like, Oh my God, where's this going? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4707.740000000001s)]
*  And instead it went the best possible way. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4710.02s)]
*  What's your next pick? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4711.860000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4714.38s)]
*  Someone's got to do it. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4714.820000000001s)]
*  I'll just go to the trade machine category. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4717.42s)]
*  No, I love this. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4719.660000000001s)]
*  Someone's got to do it. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4722.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4723.54s)]
*  Haven't talked about Yannis yet. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4726.26s)]
*  Let's talk about Yannis. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4727.42s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were going someone else. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4729.9400000000005s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4731.820000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, we can do the Durant thing. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4732.34s)]
*  We can do the, what does Boston do with its payroll thing going forward? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4734.26s)]
*  No, there's plenty of time for that. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4737.3s)]
*  Like that's all fun. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4739.18s)]
*  That's what we've all done. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4740.22s)]
*  That stuff. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4741.06s)]
*  The bucks just exist right now in this purgatory of, I think even with [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4742.46s)]
*  Dame, even with Portis coming back, even with Kuzma integrated into the lineup. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4748.74s)]
*  It just felt like. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4754.54s)]
*  With blah. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4757.3s)]
*  Just, just not good enough. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4757.82s)]
*  And, and, you know, maybe [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4759.42s)]
*  he's putting up 30, 12 and six every game. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4760.94s)]
*  And it was like, Oh, what did I just watch? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4763.38s)]
*  And I'm a Damian Lillard true believer. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4765.82s)]
*  He's been on my MVP ballot multiple times when I've had an MVP [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4767.98s)]
*  ballot on average higher than other than he was in sort of the [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4770.9s)]
*  aggregate voting in those seasons. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4774.099999999999s)]
*  I think he's one of the greatest leaders the NBA has had in a long time. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4775.82s)]
*  I'm surprised when I look at his stats from this year and I see how good they [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4780.219999999999s)]
*  are because I haven't felt that level of terror and impact from him as [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4784.62s)]
*  consistently as the stats would suggest. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4789.78s)]
*  And maybe that's just me unfairly, not unfairly, maybe that's just my brain [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4792.099999999999s)]
*  watching the bucks and being like, there's just too much, you know, there's [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4796.5s)]
*  just too much Kyle Kuzma happening. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4802.9s)]
*  There's two like Torian Prince has been awesome. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4804.7s)]
*  Just too much Torian Prince happening. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4806.78s)]
*  They're too dependent on Brooke Lopez being awesome. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4808.9s)]
*  They're just, they aren't good enough. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4811.38s)]
*  I don't think, and I don't think they've been, there's no evidence that they're [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4814.06s)]
*  good enough other than you just don't want to see Yanis ever in a playoff [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4817.1s)]
*  series and if it just, if it just ends up that they aren't good enough, you know, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4820.66s)]
*  and right now they're sixth. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4825.66s)]
*  And so I think that would manifest in Dame, no Dame, whatever it ends up being. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4827.18s)]
*  They just lose, they lose to the Knicks in six games. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4831.38s)]
*  They don't have home court. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4833.46s)]
*  The Knicks have been better than them all year. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4834.22s)]
*  Um, whatever I don't, I'd have to look deeper into that series about what the [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4836.34s)]
*  matchups would be and who would guard Yanis and who Yanis would guard and who [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4840.22s)]
*  would guard towns, Yanis would probably guard towns a lot, all that. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4842.86s)]
*  Um, you know, they don't really have a lot of pathways to just revamp the team [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4846.26s)]
*  completely in a way that makes sense. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4852.5s)]
*  We've tiptoed around this territory two or three separate times in the last five [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4856.42s)]
*  years and never gotten there. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4860.46s)]
*  I, I, is, I don't know, I don't know what else to say other than a lot of the eyes [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4861.42s)]
*  of the league are going to be on the bucks again, if they flame out in the first round. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4866.98s)]
*  I even saw there was a, I think a New York post story I saw linked on netstaley.com. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4871.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it started. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4874.86s)]
*  I didn't think it would be the playoffs when it started. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4875.74s)]
*  I mean, we're already talking about Brooklyn, it's plan A. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4878.0599999999995s)]
*  I thought, I thought Brooklyn's plan A was suck for two straight years and, but [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4880.42s)]
*  they couldn't even execute that plan well enough this year, at least the lottery was. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4884.9s)]
*  I'm not accepting any, you know, if I have to dust off Picasso, the trade [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4889.259999999999s)]
*  maintains machine territory, I will, but I, I'm not ready to talk about the [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4893.86s)]
*  honest future in detail yet, cause that's, I don't want to spoil our June podcasts. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4897.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4902.0599999999995s)]
*  But I, but I have two butts, but Houston has to be the first team if we're going [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4902.54s)]
*  to start making up fake Yanis trades. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4908.5s)]
*  How is Houston not the first team? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4910.0599999999995s)]
*  Houston has been. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4911.62s)]
*  Houston has to be the first team. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4912.339999999999s)]
*  Like I said, I could have done Durant. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4914.099999999999s)]
*  Everyone knows Durant's getting traded this summer. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4915.58s)]
*  I could have done poor Zingas holiday, however, the Celtics, if they, if they [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4917.5s)]
*  don't win the title and, or they decide we just can't be this expensive, what they [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4921.82s)]
*  do, but you know, those are easy. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4925.74s)]
*  Why not get a little dicey? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4927.42s)]
*  Well, that leads to my second butt. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4929.26s)]
*  And here's why I think I completely agree with this pick and why you went there. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4931.42s)]
*  If you're a Knicks fan and I know a bunch of them, you're not that scared of the [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4937.0599999999995s)]
*  bucks and they have Yanis in the middle of another awesome Yanis season. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4939.94s)]
*  And people like, I would you rather play the Pistons, Pacers or bucks is [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4943.54s)]
*  a real combo we're having. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4947.62s)]
*  I think Yanis could average 40 and 20 in that series and they would still lose [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4950.06s)]
*  in five or six, I don't think it would matter. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4953.38s)]
*  I just think they're beating the, they're beating the bucks. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4955.62s)]
*  And if you're Yanis, you're at the point of your career, I don't know what's [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4957.66s)]
*  important to him, he keeps it close to the vest, but is this just going to be [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4960.9s)]
*  with the rest of his career is like, I don't feel bad for him because they [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4964.3s)]
*  traded a shitload of stuff for a holiday and they won a championship. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4966.9s)]
*  So this is sometimes the price when you give up that many draft picks, eventually [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4971.98s)]
*  you got to come pay the bill at dinner and then they're paying the bill. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4976.179999999999s)]
*  I hate to say it. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4979.299999999999s)]
*  The AJ Johnson kid in Washington who got tossed into that Kuzma trade with [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4981.82s)]
*  Chris Middleton, he's got something, man. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4986.099999999999s)]
*  Like people peep the draft Knicks all were like, this dude is a monster athlete. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4989.74s)]
*  He's got something. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4993.219999999999s)]
*  And now he gets to play because if you're on the wizard's roster and you're [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4993.98s)]
*  healthy, you now get to play. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4996.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4998.860000000001s)]
*  And he's, he's got some stuff. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=4999.18s)]
*  It's not quite a Quentin Grimes level regret. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5002.42s)]
*  Just, just throw that on top of the Luca trade. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5005.22s)]
*  Grimes had 40 what now again? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5007.540000000001s)]
*  But you know, there's something there. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5010.14s)]
*  All right. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5012.06s)]
*  One more break and then we'll rip through the end of this. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5012.26s)]
*  All right. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5014.620000000001s)]
*  Since you picked the trade machine guy in Yanis, which I thought was a fantastic [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5015.46s)]
*  pick, I got to grab the other guy who has to be considered here, John Morant. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5018.780000000001s)]
*  Um, watching Memphis last night, the stuff that's been leaking out from there. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5023.1s)]
*  The past week, the fact that he doesn't play the fact that the Grizzlies now [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5027.860000000001s)]
*  feel like, um, 2022 is about 11 years ago. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5031.900000000001s)]
*  Um, I just don't know where this goes for him physically. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5035.860000000001s)]
*  It already seems like he's starting to break down a little bit. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5038.34s)]
*  There's some questions about what's going on with his knees, his shoulder. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5040.820000000001s)]
*  Uh, is he a winning player? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5044.46s)]
*  And I just would love to be in the room. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5046.46s)]
*  If Memphis and Charlotte got on the phone and started talking about John LaMelo. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5050.740000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5055.3s)]
*  I would just love to be the third party. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5055.62s)]
*  For that conversation. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5057.42s)]
*  Now the Memphis fans are going to get mad and the Charlotte fans are going to [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5059.1s)]
*  probably get mad too, but I would love to be in the room. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5061.54s)]
*  If that conversation is broached and then they both went into separate [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5064.3s)]
*  conference rooms and I'd love to be in both of those rooms at the same time. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5067.66s)]
*  As they batted around what made sense and what didn't make sense. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5071.1s)]
*  But, um, I, I just find it hard to believe that he is not going to, I don't [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5074.34s)]
*  want to say shop be shopped, but I don't think they're hanging up. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5081.58s)]
*  Well, when Zach Kleinman, the Grizz GM came out a couple of weeks ago and said, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5086.62s)]
*  in, in almost needlessly strong terms, like we're not trading John Moran. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5091.46s)]
*  Like you can, there he made some statement about like, it's cool that the, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5095.74s)]
*  it's fun that the inside people want to speculate about, we're not trading John [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5099.0199999999995s)]
*  Moran. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5102.0199999999995s)]
*  I was like, I must've, I mean, I know I haven't been fully employed this year, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5102.9s)]
*  but I must've missed the parade of people like knocking on the door to trade for [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5107.42s)]
*  first round picks for John Moran. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5112.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe I'm sure there are teams that would give up a lot of stuff for him, but I [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5113.82s)]
*  don't, you know, like he hasn't played enough. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5118.86s)]
*  And I think one of the under discussed stories of the season before the Grizzly [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5120.9s)]
*  season went off the rails was he just hasn't looked like the same guy in the [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5125.5s)]
*  ways that he has to be consistently excellent at to be a number one guy on a [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5129.82s)]
*  great team. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5136.66s)]
*  He's not finishing in the paint the same. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5137.26s)]
*  His turnovers are up. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5139.78s)]
*  He looks like wild and out of control sometimes, and he's always played with a [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5141.5s)]
*  certain wildness, but he could compensate with it. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5145.54s)]
*  He could compensate for it with just, I'm such an incredible athlete that I'll [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5148.620000000001s)]
*  make something out of this crowded, crazy situation. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5152.02s)]
*  And more often than not compared to before, he's not making anything productive [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5154.740000000001s)]
*  out of it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5158.9400000000005s)]
*  And look, the jump shot has always been a question mark. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5159.26s)]
*  He's shooting under 30% from three. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5161.22s)]
*  I think teams give him threes. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5162.780000000001s)]
*  He's took, he's taken a lot of threes in a lot of games. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5164.1s)]
*  That's either going to happen or it's not going to happen. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5166.9800000000005s)]
*  The JAMA rant thing was just all about. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5169.86s)]
*  He's going to be unstoppable in the paint and you want to pin it on this strange [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5172.82s)]
*  offense that they've been running this year with less pick and roll, more cutting, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5176.62s)]
*  more motion, the kind of wheel offense that they've been running. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5179.98s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5182.86s)]
*  Like he just hasn't looked when he get what it used to be when he got into the [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5183.66s)]
*  paint and rose up or started pivoting and faking, you knew he's going to get off [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5186.9s)]
*  a pretty clean shot here or something that works for him. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5192.0599999999995s)]
*  And now he gets in there and it's like, this could go haywire in a lot of [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5194.94s)]
*  different ways and the percentages back it up. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5197.62s)]
*  He just hasn't. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5199.46s)]
*  He look there, he has core skill sets and, and, and stuff that he's never going to [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5200.78s)]
*  be great at, he's got to be great at the core stuff to be John Moran. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5205.62s)]
*  And he hasn't been great at the core stuff this year. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5208.78s)]
*  Free throw attempts down shots, not getting better. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5211.58s)]
*  And he doesn't play. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5214.46s)]
*  We covered this on Sunday, but, uh, want to get them on the board. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5216.78s)]
*  All right. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5219.22s)]
*  You're up. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5219.46s)]
*  What I can pick any category. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5221.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5223.3s)]
*  Any category. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5223.74s)]
*  All right. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5225.62s)]
*  Let's talk about, you know, there's a feel good category. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5226.540000000001s)]
*  There's a beloved bench guy category. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5229.740000000001s)]
*  I'm going to pick somebody who qualifies for both. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5232.1s)]
*  I was so happy to hear you talk up the case of Malik Beasley for six man of the year. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5235.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5241.700000000001s)]
*  Um, we have not talked about the piston jet other than a little aside on Cade. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5241.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't even quite understand how they're this good. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5246.14s)]
*  Um, but they, they're, they've been a top 10 net rating team now almost for the [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5249.02s)]
*  full season and top six or seven for quite a while. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5253.26s)]
*  And I can hear this, the internet, the internet, uh, smart guys being like, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5257.3s)]
*  well, you know, Malik Beasley on the playoffs, he's going to struggle on [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5262.02s)]
*  defense. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5264.7s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5265.26s)]
*  We know like we got it. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5265.9400000000005s)]
*  Like he's going to get targeted on defense. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5267.26s)]
*  It's not a great defense, but everybody knows he's been so phenomenal offensively [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5268.900000000001s)]
*  and so critical to unlocking that team and that roster and Cade specifically [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5273.62s)]
*  and Duran and just, he just keeps shooting threes. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5279.02s)]
*  He's, I haven't looked it up in the last month, but I was like a month ago. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5282.02s)]
*  I tweeted something like he was at some threshold of, of attempts, like 12 per [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5285.620000000001s)]
*  36 minutes or 11 per 36 minutes and over 42% that only Steph had ever done before [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5290.9400000000005s)]
*  in any season. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5297.42s)]
*  And I kept hearing how the sixth man of the year was going to come down to [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5298.900000000001s)]
*  Peyton Pritchard and Ty Jerome. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5302.740000000001s)]
*  Like, am I crazy or is Malik Beasley been neck and neck with Peyton [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5305.1s)]
*  Pritchard and above Ty Jerome just based on minutes played alone? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5308.42s)]
*  Ty Jerome has been unbelievable for the Cavs. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5311.34s)]
*  Um, Deandre Hunter also belongs in that conversation, but Malik Beasley should [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5313.78s)]
*  be in, in consideration for number one and sixth man of the year. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5318.9800000000005s)]
*  And that team, like, I don't know how high their ceiling is. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5323.22s)]
*  I don't know how Jalen Duran who I've always been much higher on. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5327.3s)]
*  I have like a, he's one of my like white whale of the NBA. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5330.18s)]
*  I'm just fascinated by him. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5333.66s)]
*  This, the physicality, the athleticism and all that. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5334.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know how he's going to respond. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5337.66s)]
*  He's only 21 still, I think. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5339.18s)]
*  To play off offenses going at him in the pick and roll. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5340.98s)]
*  I'm not quite as scared of them. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5344.1s)]
*  If I'm one of the East favorites is maybe the numbers suggest I should be, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5346.86s)]
*  but they are a great story and Malik Beasley has been a huge part of it. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5350.42s)]
*  So I'm just going to give him a little nod as my beloved bench guy. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5354.78s)]
*  I love it. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5357.9s)]
*  And I'm with you. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5359.1s)]
*  Like, I'm just telling you right now, I'm voting for him for sixth man of the year. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5360.1s)]
*  Um, Pritchard is minus. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5364.18s)]
*  You're going to get booed in Boston. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5365.62s)]
*  And that, I love Pritchard. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5367.66s)]
*  The Pritch please shirts. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5369.22s)]
*  You're not, you're not going to be allowed to buy one of those. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5370.5s)]
*  I love Pritchard, but he's on an awesome team and the team can survive whether [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5372.42s)]
*  he's good or not game to game. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5377.660000000001s)]
*  The trick can't Beasley is beyond an irrational confidence guy for him. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5379.02s)]
*  They actually need him to make big shots night after night after night to succeed. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5383.54s)]
*  The Celtics don't need Pritchard in the same way. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5387.700000000001s)]
*  Like he's eight to one for six men in the air. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5390.18s)]
*  I don't, I don't get that. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5392.5s)]
*  I think Pritchard is going to win, but I just think Beasley's for coming off the [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5393.9400000000005s)]
*  bench, what he has to do and what his role is. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5398.58s)]
*  I think it's more important. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5401.18s)]
*  I am going to grab my beloved bench guy since she took one, um, Al [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5402.86s)]
*  Horford for the Boston Celtics. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5407.3s)]
*  Who it feels like his career should either be over or close. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5409.74s)]
*  I don't really fully understand it. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5415.42s)]
*  And if you do the exercise of going back into the two thousands and seeing how [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5417.34s)]
*  many guys from the drafts in the two thousands are still playing, he is now, I [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5421.0199999999995s)]
*  think one of the last guys left. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5425.46s)]
*  That's like LeBron, Chris Paul, him, Conley, uh, Durant. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5426.9400000000005s)]
*  I think those are the. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5431.7s)]
*  The final five maybe from years of service, but he also played in college. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5433.38s)]
*  Wasn't like he was like one year down in college. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5438.3s)]
*  I think he had at least two years, maybe three in college. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5440.3s)]
*  Um, he's so important to the Celtics team again, and I don't know whether [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5443.46s)]
*  it's a rejuvenation thing. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5447.42s)]
*  He stopped eating red meat. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5448.74s)]
*  What's going on, but he's swinging games. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5450.02s)]
*  Like everyone talked about that Laker game when he defended LeBron over and over [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5452.7s)]
*  and over again, or Luca or whoever they would have thrown him, but he's become [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5456.66s)]
*  really important and they figured out how to move him through the season, not put [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5460.46s)]
*  too much wear and tear on him and he's going to be a huge asset for them. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5465.179999999999s)]
*  And I can't believe the kind of careers happen. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5469.099999999999s)]
*  He's like, he's a guaranteed hall of famer now, I think. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5471.179999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5473.7s)]
*  I mean, everybody makes it. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5474.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how many all-star teams he's made off the top, but enough. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5475.58s)]
*  But you know what other hall of fame he's in? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5479.099999999999s)]
*  He's in the, I can't believe you reinvented the second half of your [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5481.179999999999s)]
*  career like this hall of fame. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5484.66s)]
*  Or if you watch what he was the first half of it versus what he is now, there's [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5486.74s)]
*  some similarities, but it's a completely different impact, everything. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5490.82s)]
*  So, uh, when you consider his career was almost over five years ago, we're still. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5494.34s)]
*  And I talked about a couple of weeks ago, like, well, and it was a wrap in Philly. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5498.46s)]
*  It keeps changing because when he turned into a spacing three-point shooting, big [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5502.66s)]
*  man, uh, five time also, by the way, um, it started off as it often does of like, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5506.54s)]
*  all right, the releases medium to slow. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5513.86s)]
*  He needs some time and space. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5515.94s)]
*  And now it's just, if he's in the corner, you can contest it. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5517.18s)]
*  He, you can be closing out on him. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5520.26s)]
*  That thing is up there quick. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5522.26s)]
*  And he had 26 points last night. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5523.9s)]
*  He's still a force defensively. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5526.5s)]
*  I will say, you know, he's had as, as switchy as he still is for his age. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5528.74s)]
*  He's had playoff moments against both Donovan Mitchell and Trey [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5535.099999999999s)]
*  Young, who we haven't talked about. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5538.62s)]
*  Trey Young is on my list for a lot of different categories where those quicker, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5539.66s)]
*  smaller guys on switches can make him look old again. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5543.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5547.62s)]
*  Um, but the Celtics are look, I mean, I picked them to win the championship. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5548.099999999999s)]
*  I'd still pick them to win the championship. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5551.5s)]
*  He's been awesome. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5552.78s)]
*  And I think you've got to just be so relieved that poor Zingas has come back [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5553.5s)]
*  from whatever viral thing that was and looks spectacular. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5558.0599999999995s)]
*  We don't, we don't talk about my dad and I don't talk about poor Zingas. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5561.0599999999995s)]
*  We've just agreed not to discuss anything. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5564.1s)]
*  It's like talking, if he plays for two straight weeks, it's like talking through [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5565.9400000000005s)]
*  a no hitter, just like, eh, first thing's looking pretty good. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5569.1s)]
*  Uh, Corford, I think in the running for most beloved Celtic teammate, I can [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5572.660000000001s)]
*  remember just from anecdotally what people in the organization say, what the [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5577.860000000001s)]
*  teammates say, the quotes that are in newspapers, just beloved. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5583.58s)]
*  I mean, it really feels like he, he had like a lifelong impact on Tatum as a [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5589.0599999999995s)]
*  human being, like shit like that shit that goes beyond basketball. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5595.419999999999s)]
*  I just think he is an all-timer. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5598.86s)]
*  I hope he keeps coming to games after he retires. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5601.259999999999s)]
*  Um, he has moved into the fabric of the team in the city in a real way. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5604.219999999999s)]
*  Well, I remember when they were, when they were in the finals last year [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5608.54s)]
*  and they were up two, one, three, one. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5611.74s)]
*  You know, I wrote a big, for Grantland, I wrote a big profile of [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5614.82s)]
*  Al Warford back in the day. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5617.419999999999s)]
*  I remember that one. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5618.9s)]
*  Um, and I just started calling, I, I, I thought about, maybe I should write [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5619.54s)]
*  something, I maybe I could work it into the Celtics with the championship piece [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5624.46s)]
*  and it ultimately died on the vine. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5628.0199999999995s)]
*  But I started calling just like Joe Keef, Noah, Kyle Corver, Billy [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5629.94s)]
*  Donovan, Kenny Atkinson, Mike Budenholzer. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5634.18s)]
*  Suspecting that they were all watching the finals with more of an emotional [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5637.9s)]
*  investment that you would think, considering the distance between them [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5642.54s)]
*  and Al Warford. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5645.7s)]
*  And they were all dying for him to finally win the championship. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5646.9s)]
*  I mean, they were all over the moon for him. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5651.74s)]
*  Billy Donovan was like texting me from Europe being like, do you need a quote? [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5654.38s)]
*  You know, here's like, like they just love that guy. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5657.58s)]
*  Every stop on his career, all those people were watching the finals being [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5661.02s)]
*  like, this guy deserves to win the championship. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5665.38s)]
*  You just don't see that as much anymore. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5667.34s)]
*  No, you don't. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5669.22s)]
*  All right. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5670.38s)]
*  We got to, we got to move with some pace now. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5670.74s)]
*  What's your next pick? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5672.74s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5674.54s)]
*  Why don't you take Trey Young somewhere? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5675.46s)]
*  Wait, let's talk about him. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5676.82s)]
*  I'll go crossroads guy. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5678.06s)]
*  Trey Young, you know, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5680.22s)]
*  you don't want to take it to crossroads guys. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5683.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5685.7s)]
*  I'm going to allow it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5686.18s)]
*  I'm going to allow it. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5687.22s)]
*  Uh, what? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5688.38s)]
*  No, I can put it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5689.26s)]
*  I can be a trade. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5689.86s)]
*  You can be a trade machine guy. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5690.62s)]
*  You can't be a feel good guy. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5692.22s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5694.26s)]
*  I mean, my feel good guy. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5695.42s)]
*  I'll tell you, you know what? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5696.5s)]
*  I'll tell you, no, I'm not going to take Trey Young. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5697.18s)]
*  My feel good guy, I guess will be Steph Curry. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5699.14s)]
*  Um, because this was the best case scenario for Steph Curry. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5701.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5706.38s)]
*  You just don't get, even when you have the rare chances that the warriors got as [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5706.620000000001s)]
*  an elite team who had this like gap year or gap years where they got to pick high [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5713.06s)]
*  in the draft and they whiffed on the highest pick they had in Wiseman, you just [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5716.58s)]
*  don't get to contend for this long. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5722.14s)]
*  And the most likely outcome for Steph was always going to be, he rides out the [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5725.3s)]
*  Twilight and Golden State, the most likely good outcome, good outcome, upside [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5730.86s)]
*  outcome was he rides out the Twilight and Golden State on good solid teams that [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5735.86s)]
*  don't really have a chance to win the championship, but they're good enough. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5741.0599999999995s)]
*  They're 46, 48, 49 win teams that if they made the conference finals, because of [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5743.54s)]
*  matchups and just excellence, luck, whatever, be like, oh, it's not surprising. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5748.299999999999s)]
*  It's kind of a fun team. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5753.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think because the Butler trade just fell into the league's lap, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5754.66s)]
*  they're better than that. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5758.7s)]
*  Now I still, it's hard for me to see them winning the championship, but they're, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5759.94s)]
*  they're a pretty goddamn good team with him, Butler. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5764.82s)]
*  And I just think, you know, the warriors are 18 and five with those two guys. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5768.42s)]
*  They're a threat to beat anybody in the West, maybe accepting Oklahoma City. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5774.179999999999s)]
*  Cause they're just such a giant favorite over everybody else. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5777.74s)]
*  I just think it's going to be awesome. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5780.339999999999s)]
*  Assuming they make the top six, which is not guaranteed by any means that we're [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5782.0599999999995s)]
*  going to see them play real meaningful games with real meaningful stakes where [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5787.3s)]
*  it's not just like, Oh, this is kind of cute that Steph has a chance to win a [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5790.9800000000005s)]
*  first round series and we all know they're going to get destroyed in the next round. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5793.740000000001s)]
*  Like it's not that this is a real team. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5796.54s)]
*  It's a delight. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5800.820000000001s)]
*  And it's why you do the Jimmy Butler trade, which I described as not a Hail Mary, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5801.820000000001s)]
*  but throwing into double coverage on third and 14 and hoping your guy makes a play. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5806.34s)]
*  They had to do it. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5811.740000000001s)]
*  You just, I loved it. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5813.34s)]
*  I loved it for them right from the start. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5814.18s)]
*  I saw, I saw it was completely risk-free. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5816.0199999999995s)]
*  I would have put cominga in it too. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5818.38s)]
*  If I had to, if it was the choice between the first round pick or cominga, I would [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5820.0599999999995s)]
*  have, I would have thrown cominga in there. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5823.62s)]
*  Um, it's a great pick. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5826.139999999999s)]
*  I have nothing to add. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5827.86s)]
*  Feel good star for me. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5829.86s)]
*  Um, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5832.0599999999995s)]
*  I think Mitchell belongs here because, um, you know, the Utah thing wasn't, he, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5836.98s)]
*  he had some good moments there and it got a little rocky near the end. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5845.3s)]
*  And then he goes to Cleveland and it was a weird trade. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5848.5s)]
*  They gave up a lot. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5852.14s)]
*  And then the next couple of years, people like me, and maybe even you were talking [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5853.46s)]
*  about, he eventually wants ends up in New York, which I'm a hundred percent sure [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5858.9800000000005s)]
*  is true. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5862.22s)]
*  Um, and then the next door closes with Brunson Brooklyn falls apart and it becomes [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5863.26s)]
*  one of those situations where it's like, maybe this is the best spot for me. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5868.780000000001s)]
*  I really think that he probably went through that thought exercise and landed [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5871.62s)]
*  there. Like we have really good players. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5874.46s)]
*  Maybe I could be on a championship team. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5876.14s)]
*  How do I elevate these guys? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5878.22s)]
*  And, you know, we talked about how he slipped a little since the all star [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5880.9s)]
*  break, but the game the other night was a good example of like, he still has that. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5883.54s)]
*  That thing to him, you know, that when you're in a playoff series, we're in a [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5890.14s)]
*  game six, game seven, I need somebody who can go toe to toe with whoever the best [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5893.62s)]
*  guy is in another team. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5898.62s)]
*  I think he has it and he has a chance to now not only be a first team, all NBA [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5899.58s)]
*  guy, but to make, maybe play for the, in the finals. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5905.3s)]
*  Um, I think he's a great guy. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5909.62s)]
*  I've always heard good things about him. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5911.62s)]
*  Um, he does a lot of good charitable stuff and, uh, seems like a good teammate. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5913.78s)]
*  I think the calves guys all love them. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5917.82s)]
*  And I'm just happy he's in that moment. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5920.1s)]
*  Cause I like them. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5922.18s)]
*  One peg down the Darius Garland situation also could have gone sideways [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5923.54s)]
*  and around that were, were about his, I wouldn't say unhappiness, but the [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5928.7s)]
*  uncertainty of whether this was really going to be the place for him with Don [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5933.54s)]
*  of in Mitchell, having superseded him as the alpha guy in the back court. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5936.46s)]
*  Those were true. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5940.5s)]
*  And he's figured it out. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5941.78s)]
*  He got healthy. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5942.62s)]
*  They figured it out together. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5943.3s)]
*  He's one of my favorite players to watch in the NBA deserved all star. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5944.34s)]
*  Um, it's, it's a great, great pick. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5948.58s)]
*  Love it. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5950.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5951.139999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5951.78s)]
*  You're up. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5951.98s)]
*  I can't believe we haven't done hot seat coach yet. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5953.34s)]
*  Well, cause it's like, we're both scared. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5955.46s)]
*  It's a sad conversation to have. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5957.5s)]
*  Well, we can do, why don't you just do fat fat one. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5959.780000000001s)]
*  Let's do, let's each do a hot seat coach really pay. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5962.14s)]
*  We don't have to talk about it. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5964.18s)]
*  I'll just pick one. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5965.14s)]
*  I mean, you know, Mike Booth and Olser. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5966.38s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5971.34s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5972.02s)]
*  I think the seat it's like an inferno. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5972.740000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's hot. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5975.820000000001s)]
*  I think he's sitting in a pool of lava. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5976.740000000001s)]
*  Like he's, he's a proven good coach and B are you that embarrassing that you're [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5978.820000000001s)]
*  just going to have a new coach every single year? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5984.1s)]
*  This is going to keep, just keep doing this. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5985.94s)]
*  Like you're not going to get any coach. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5988.099999999999s)]
*  You're not going to get any coach anytime. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5989.78s)]
*  I don't see how he comes back. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5992.66s)]
*  I just think this is, this is who Ishby is. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5996.139999999999s)]
*  I think he just every year is like, all right, this, none of this was my fault again. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=5999.0199999999995s)]
*  Who could I blame? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6003.0199999999995s)]
*  I have tips for this category. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6004.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6006.5s)]
*  Yeah, I sure do. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6007.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6010.7s)]
*  Over. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6012.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, I could think of like three names. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6012.98s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6014.74s)]
*  Not even counting the teams that aren't making the playoffs. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6015.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm just looking at playoff teams. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6018.06s)]
*  I have to, wow. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6019.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6021.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6022.14s)]
*  Make the case. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6022.46s)]
*  I have a feeling I know the case, but I want to hear you make the case. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6023.06s)]
*  Defensively. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6027.5s)]
*  They're pretty easy to score on. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6029.820000000001s)]
*  Offensively. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6031.9800000000005s)]
*  The numbers are great. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6033.06s)]
*  And the Brunson towns thing is legendary. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6034.62s)]
*  All that stuff. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6036.34s)]
*  Um, I just feel like from a creativity standpoint, the stuff you mentioned earlier, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6037.3s)]
*  and I've been talking about all year and the next fans don't want to hear it, but I [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6042.78s)]
*  just don't understand why you're trading all that stuff for bridges and then, you [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6045.86s)]
*  know, give a shit about using them ever. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6048.5s)]
*  I think there's a version of this team that is way scarier to me as a Celtics fan [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6050.38s)]
*  than they've tapped into. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6055.5s)]
*  I don't think he's used the bench enough. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6057.0599999999995s)]
*  I think he's played the guys way too many minutes. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6058.74s)]
*  You don't think so? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6061.62s)]
*  You don't think the bench has been utilized enough? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6062.3s)]
*  There was a game in December. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6064.82s)]
*  I think it was December where they, I didn't watch the game. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6066.7s)]
*  I looked at the box for the next day. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6070.179999999999s)]
*  They beat the Hornets by 24 points. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6072.0199999999995s)]
*  I think the final score is one 25, one on one. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6074.38s)]
*  I don't obviously 24 game, 24 point game can be semi close. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6077.42s)]
*  It's points, whatever. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6080.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6082.099999999999s)]
*  McHale bridges. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6082.46s)]
*  Someone could fact check me on this. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6083.46s)]
*  I'm going from the top of my head. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6084.74s)]
*  Played the first 46 minutes and 30 seconds of the game consecutively in a game. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6086.18s)]
*  The Knicks won by 24 points. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6091.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6094.7s)]
*  And I was like, how, how is that even, how's that even allowed? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6094.94s)]
*  Like, I don't like anyway. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6100.419999999999s)]
*  We both like Tibbs. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6103.74s)]
*  I think there's a real question of whether his coaching style can be sustainable for [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6104.9s)]
*  10 months. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6109.379999999999s)]
*  If you're trying nine months, if you're trying to win a title and we're going to [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6110.259999999999s)]
*  find out, Brunson stepped on somebody's foot. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6113.219999999999s)]
*  It wasn't the, you can't say it was the minutes that caused it, but I just, I [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6115.74s)]
*  don't think it's sustainable how he coaches. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6119.86s)]
*  And I don't think he's been creative enough. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6121.58s)]
*  Let me defend the offensive creation. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6123.299999999999s)]
*  Creation is maybe the wrong word. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6125.86s)]
*  Um, because the Bridges thing has been, uh, underutilized until now in part [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6127.42s)]
*  because the town's Brunson thing is, is so unguardable. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6133.1s)]
*  So Tibbs has been, and all the Tibbs backers around the league will tell you. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6136.740000000001s)]
*  He's been, his teams have performed better offensively than his reputation. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6141.06s)]
*  He's had a lot of top 10 offenses in Minnesota, Chicago, elsewhere. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6144.5s)]
*  And even though he's been pigeonholed as this defensive mastermind behind the [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6149.900000000001s)]
*  2008 Celtics and other great defensive teams, the Bulls with Noah and [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6153.38s)]
*  Gibson and all those guys. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6157.22s)]
*  Um, and that's true. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6159.38s)]
*  They're right. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6161.06s)]
*  And almost all of those offenses have been of just the complete brute force [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6162.38s)]
*  variety, like we just don't turn the ball over. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6167.06s)]
*  We're number one or two in offensive rebounding. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6169.860000000001s)]
*  We're number one or two in free throws. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6171.9400000000005s)]
*  And we just beat the hell out of you. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6173.5s)]
*  We just, we isolate, we play simple basketball, low risk basketball, and [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6175.1s)]
*  we beat the hell out of you. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6179.58s)]
*  This team still has some of that in it, but it's not built to be a great [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6180.9s)]
*  offensive rebounding team. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6183.58s)]
*  It's not built to be a beat the hell out of you team. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6184.5s)]
*  It is built to have a Josh Hart runs the ball down your throat, six times a game [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6186.46s)]
*  team, but I do, I, you can quibble with the Bridges thing and I think you're right. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6190.1s)]
*  I do think. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6195.34s)]
*  Can I quibble with the minutes thing too? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6196.66s)]
*  Because it's those two things together that I think are the biggest red flags. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6198.0599999999995s)]
*  That's definitely right. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6201.1s)]
*  But I do think it was interesting and smart how he decided to use towns as a [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6201.66s)]
*  passing hub very early on in the season. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6208.26s)]
*  They have a lot of artful cutting in their offense because of the way towns [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6210.860000000001s)]
*  lifts the opposing center off. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6214.34s)]
*  If the center is guarding him, Bridges is a good cutter in an OB is a good [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6215.740000000001s)]
*  Carter, heart is a great cutter. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6218.9800000000005s)]
*  And he leaned into that in a way that I think was smart and made their offense a [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6220.66s)]
*  little bit more unpredictable than Brunson pounding the ball and cat pounding [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6224.26s)]
*  post-ups and just spamming pick and pops, which I think they could always run more. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6228.34s)]
*  Pick and pops with those guys. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6232.34s)]
*  I, I early in the season, I was like, this is different than I envisioned it. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6233.42s)]
*  And he's built an elite offense. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6237.3s)]
*  Now he's got elite offensive talent, no doubt, but he's constructed an elite [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6239.22s)]
*  offense that doesn't look anything like, and doesn't project statistically anything [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6242.9400000000005s)]
*  like the other elite offenses that he's had before counter. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6246.66s)]
*  He has awesome guys on offense. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6250.18s)]
*  You and I could have done that. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6251.820000000001s)]
*  It's true. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6253.1s)]
*  It's true. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6254.5s)]
*  He's on the hot seat for me. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6255.06s)]
*  If they lose to that weird bucks team in round one, or they get absolutely smoked [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6256.34s)]
*  by the Celtics around too. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6260.34s)]
*  Well, so, so I think that's the most likely outcome, right? [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6261.78s)]
*  Is like the Celtics beat them for one, maybe four, two. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6264.66s)]
*  And is that, is that a failure or, or do you say, well, you know, we may say [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6268.54s)]
*  he's taken them as far as they could go. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6274.42s)]
*  Well, we'll find out. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6276.099999999999s)]
*  What's your next pick? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6277.3s)]
*  Well, can I just name another coach? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6278.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6280.66s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6281.38s)]
*  I'm a little rusty on this one. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6282.9s)]
*  Let me be very clear for the avogators aggregators. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6283.98s)]
*  Um, this coach is not in any danger of being fired. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6287.58s)]
*  This coach's seat is ice cold. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6291.099999999999s)]
*  This coach was in the coach of the year conversation last year. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6293.62s)]
*  I think he was number two on my ballot and he was on pace to be that high this [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6296.42s)]
*  year before injury struck his team. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6300.42s)]
*  We are long past the point where the Orlando Magic's offense, despite Suggs [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6302.900000000001s)]
*  being out, despite Anthony being out, despite Mo Wagner being out, all of that. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6308.22s)]
*  It just should not be this bad. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6311.700000000001s)]
*  It's so bad and so unwatchable and so uncreative that at some point someone [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6313.740000000001s)]
*  in the, what is remains of the basketball media in Orlando has to [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6320.78s)]
*  gently ask the question of like, so what's the idea for this offense? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6324.5s)]
*  And now the idea might be, we trade a lot of points, seven, eight points per possession. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6329.62s)]
*  What the idea might be. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6333.54s)]
*  We trade a lot of stuff for a guard that can create a lot of the [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6334.74s)]
*  offense. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6337.9s)]
*  We don't have that. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6338.219999999999s)]
*  The idea might be, we trade a lot of stuff for a center that is either a [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6339.0599999999995s)]
*  threat diving to the basket, a threat popping for threes, a threat as a pastor. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6342.34s)]
*  They don't really have a guy who's a really good at any of those things. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6345.66s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6350.34s)]
*  Um, so those are all fair answers too, but the coaching staff has just gotten [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6351.139999999999s)]
*  no scrutiny for the fact that this offense stinks and it stinks no matter [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6357.0199999999995s)]
*  who's on the court and it's, they're like 27th in offense and I know their guys [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6360.82s)]
*  were hurt and I know that they had injuries that it takes those oblique [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6365.58s)]
*  things for Franz and Paolo. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6369.82s)]
*  It takes time to recover from them. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6371.22s)]
*  They still stink now offensively. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6372.82s)]
*  It's like, it's, it's, they scored 87 points last night against the Clippers. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6374.66s)]
*  So I'm going to make that hot seat wild card. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6379.1s)]
*  So we had hot seat coach and that was supposed to be hot seat player, but we'll [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6381.900000000001s)]
*  make it a wild card pick player coach. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6386.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6388.26s)]
*  Can we, I don't know why their office is so bad. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6388.46s)]
*  Can we just at least have a meeting about it where we're like, maybe we need to [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6390.820000000001s)]
*  bring in an assistant who does this really well. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6394.54s)]
*  Can we at least talk about it? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6396.34s)]
*  Are we not allowed or when do, when is the expiration date on the magic or [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6397.38s)]
*  like a feel good story is that, are we done with that yet? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6400.820000000001s)]
*  Maybe they can hire one of the 17 fired Grizzlies assistant coaches and have [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6404.1s)]
*  them treat them like a real team now. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6408.0199999999995s)]
*  Like it's really right now is high-fiving people in his living room. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6410.139999999999s)]
*  I have for my hot seat wild card, Julius Randall. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6415.7s)]
*  We don't need to talk about it. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6417.94s)]
*  There's this scenario where he just completely torpedoes Minnesota in round [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6419.339999999999s)]
*  one and people are like, that guy sucks. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6422.419999999999s)]
*  You can never run them. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6424.5s)]
*  He ruined Minnesota. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6425.86s)]
*  Got to get him out of here. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6427.0599999999995s)]
*  I would, we all see it. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6428.379999999999s)]
*  I would advise those fans to not check his playoffs. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6429.7s)]
*  Which are in very few games, but still. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6432.86s)]
*  What's your next pick? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6435.74s)]
*  You still have to pick an apex superstar. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6437.38s)]
*  Uh, I mean, I was just going to pick, I was just going to pick [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6440.06s)]
*  Luca because it's been the subplot of the fascinating plot of the season. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6442.46s)]
*  Is Luca Donchich's place for the Los Angeles Lakers. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6446.9s)]
*  He plays for LeBron James. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6449.62s)]
*  He led his team to the finals last year and the conference finals two years ago. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6451.54s)]
*  Uh, you know, look, we don't need to get into the trade or the, the off court, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6455.74s)]
*  whatever issues that are, are, you know, just are what they are and are, have [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6460.66s)]
*  been what they have been. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6465.82s)]
*  I don't think he's looked like a, a, a plus Luca yet in LA almost at all. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6467.46s)]
*  Um, he still looks a little slower than usual to me and he's not a speed guy. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6473.86s)]
*  The game we went to, he scored what? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6478.82s)]
*  21 points in the first eight minutes. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6480.78s)]
*  It was really exciting. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6482.98s)]
*  And it was really exciting. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6484.219999999999s)]
*  He shot tons of threes, his two point field goal percentages down, his turnovers [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6485.219999999999s)]
*  are up and a lot of that is just learning new system, new city, new [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6488.7s)]
*  teammates, new world. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6492.78s)]
*  Like, like the best player of the generation is over here and I'm on his [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6493.78s)]
*  team and, and I think they've all bought into the right things. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6498.26s)]
*  He's been very good for them. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6502.0599999999995s)]
*  He would make an all star team. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6503.26s)]
*  He would make an all NBA team. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6504.5s)]
*  He would probably make first team all NBA for sure. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6505.7s)]
*  Well, I don't know if for sure, but he would make first team on [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6509.5s)]
*  NBA if he were healthy and playing this exactly the way he's played for the [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6511.46s)]
*  Lakers, he's almost the first team all NBA caliber player, if not definitely. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6514.7s)]
*  So, and so you wouldn't have traded Anthony Davis and Max Christie [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6517.82s)]
*  in a number one form. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6521.86s)]
*  I wouldn't have done it from whose perspective I would have done. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6524.139999999999s)]
*  You wouldn't have taken that as a trade offer. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6526.42s)]
*  If you were the maps, you would have said, no, I would have been your move. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6528.299999999999s)]
*  If I worked in the maps front office, I think I would be fired. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6533.46s)]
*  No, I think, I think Nico Harrison would have fired me or I, because I would [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6536.9s)]
*  have just, I would have thrown everything I had against this trade and they would [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6541.42s)]
*  have found me annoying and an irritant. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6547.219999999999s)]
*  I do, I do think, you know, a robust discussion within the [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6548.82s)]
*  maps front office occurred at some point, but, um, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6553.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, but I thought only three people knew about the trade. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6556.5s)]
*  When, when do we have to stop pretending that that was the case? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6559.46s)]
*  But I, but I can't [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6562.0599999999995s)]
*  pretend that LeBron and Rich Paul and Anthony Davis didn't know about it. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6562.9s)]
*  I can't believe he's on the Lakers. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6566.38s)]
*  And right away you framed it. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6568.219999999999s)]
*  Not you. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6569.98s)]
*  A lot of people framed it correctly as like, wow, they've got the bridge, the [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6571.139999999999s)]
*  bridge to the post LeBron era, which they did not have before. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6575.299999999999s)]
*  They have the best possible unimaginable version of it. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6577.94s)]
*  And I think in the shock of the trade and the realization that the Lakers had [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6582.339999999999s)]
*  found yet another generational superstar to carry the generational superstar torch. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6587.86s)]
*  I think it took like a week or 10 days for people to be like, Oh, this team's [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6592.419999999999s)]
*  kind of good, like it seems kind of interesting and dangerous and they can [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6597.66s)]
*  play different styles and different lineups with no center and. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6602.099999999999s)]
*  Well, should we do an RIP for the people who had the 48 hours of, I'm not [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6605.459999999999s)]
*  sure these guys can play together. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6609.82s)]
*  That was one of my favorites. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6611.54s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6614.299999999999s)]
*  That was great. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6615.5s)]
*  That was a nice little basketball IQ test. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6616.179999999999s)]
*  It's it's like we've all, I think starting with Wade and LeBron, there's [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6618.379999999999s)]
*  just been this overthinking of, well, you just can't pair two ball dominant guys. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6624.66s)]
*  Just can't. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6628.94s)]
*  It's just, it's even though that duo obviously succeeded at a crazy level. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6629.299999999999s)]
*  It's like, that's LeBron James. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6633.22s)]
*  It's a different story. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6635.26s)]
*  LeBron James in his prime. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6636.14s)]
*  Like, they're not just two ball dominant guys. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6638.02s)]
*  They're two of the five greatest pastors, maybe ever. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6643.5s)]
*  And they're two ball dominant guys with very good to elite post-up games. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6646.780000000001s)]
*  And that's the kind of thing that Phoenix and all its ball dominant guys does not have. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6653.22s)]
*  They don't have guys who can change the geometry of the floor in tons of different [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6656.9800000000005s)]
*  ways by getting to spots on the floor with a bully ball game that those two guys have. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6660.82s)]
*  Let alone the transition game. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6666.259999999999s)]
*  They both have an inside outside game and can pass. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6667.5s)]
*  And the other thing is they don't have to play all the minutes together. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6669.5s)]
*  That's the piece I thought of right away. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6673.0599999999995s)]
*  And I wasn't alone. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6675.5s)]
*  I'm like, well, fuck, one of these guys is going to be out there for two and a half hours. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6676.38s)]
*  Well, and you know what? [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6680.42s)]
*  You know what I've loved that the Lakers have done? [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6681.219999999999s)]
*  If you watch their rotations carefully, Luca is the one who gets the solo minutes. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6683.0199999999995s)]
*  Reeves and LeBron will be on the bench together. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6687.7s)]
*  And almost all the time, LeBron is out there. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6689.94s)]
*  If Luke is resting, Reeves is also playing with LeBron. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6692.62s)]
*  So LeBron does not have to do the heavy lifting by himself ever. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6695.34s)]
*  And I know he's been by his standards, unproductive as a scorer lately, by his [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6699.26s)]
*  incredible standards, I think that is the only avenue to set them up for short-term [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6703.66s)]
*  success was to lift the burden on LeBron to that degree and unlock all this other [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6709.54s)]
*  stuff that we talked about earlier that they're doing. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6713.9s)]
*  Well, and I think this is a really dangerous team that if Luca can rediscover [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6716.099999999999s)]
*  a Luca form, I just, I never want to see that guy in a playoff series. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6720.98s)]
*  And they got, they got a lot of like game Vincent, they got a lot of stuff [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6725.54s)]
*  going on right now that's interesting. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6729.18s)]
*  And the crowd likes the team. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6730.78s)]
*  They're going to be tough to beat in LA. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6731.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6733.26s)]
*  The, the, uh, well, that leads to my third banana pick, which is Austin Reeves. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6733.46s)]
*  We don't need to spend 10 minutes on it, but I think he's the best third, the [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6738.5s)]
*  best third score on a team, not just this year, but in a while, like when you're [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6743.06s)]
*  talking about a guy that might be able to score in the thirties, even if the [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6749.900000000001s)]
*  whole team's playing, but also one of our two guys is out, can you score 40 [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6754.42s)]
*  tonight and he can do that. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6758.02s)]
*  There's nobody, nobody has that in the NBA right now and nobody's had it for a [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6759.3s)]
*  while. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6763.02s)]
*  I was trying to think of like best third scores on really good teams and you go [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6763.3s)]
*  backwards to Steph KD and then clay was the third score, but even as great as [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6768.7s)]
*  clay was and as great of a shooter as he was, you couldn't run the offense through [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6774.34s)]
*  him. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6778.22s)]
*  They can run the offense to Reeves for like six, seven minutes and he actually [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6778.98s)]
*  can create shots for himself or other people. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6782.46s)]
*  Like it's, it's pretty great. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6785.22s)]
*  So I, there's a lot of good third bananas. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6786.94s)]
*  I think he's the best one. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6789.5s)]
*  Phoenix fans are so mad that they're scoring trio. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6790.98s)]
*  Just, we didn't even, didn't even pop up in the other, our brains also mad. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6794.98s)]
*  Uh, Sacramento Kings fans who are like, well, what about the Zach Levine, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6798.9s)]
*  Damar DeRosa and the Monte Sabonis trio? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6801.94s)]
*  That's pretty, can we talk about that? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6803.94s)]
*  By the way, that's a team to watch and they're not even, we haven't even [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6805.94s)]
*  mentioned them yet. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6808.5s)]
*  What's your next pick? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6809.0599999999995s)]
*  Levine was going to be one of my, I don't know what categories we have left, but [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6810.139999999999s)]
*  Levine was going to be a third banana pick for me as well. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6813.46s)]
*  Just because, um, what a, what a catastrophic year for a franchise that [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6817.74s)]
*  seemed to have finally veered out of the catastrophe lane and just was like, you [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6826.98s)]
*  know what we want, we want, we want to go right back to it. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6830.339999999999s)]
*  Let's just fire the coach. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6833.179999999999s)]
*  Do you like what they got in the Fox trade at all? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6834.259999999999s)]
*  Um, then they got some okay draft equity. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6837.74s)]
*  I mean, if you're going to have to trade a guy to get an all-star in Zach [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6840.379999999999s)]
*  Levine has been an all-star and some draft equity is fine. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6843.82s)]
*  Like I just like the fact that they fired the coach, the fact that they [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6847.179999999999s)]
*  pissed him off so much. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6850.299999999999s)]
*  And now he's talked about it on record in a couple of different places. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6852.5s)]
*  He's like, yeah, they fired the coach and they left me to hang out to dry and [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6855.5s)]
*  made it look like it was my fault. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6858.18s)]
*  And I actually liked the coach and like, what's wrong with our organization? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6859.42s)]
*  Not great when an ex player we just traded who was like a beloved part of [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6863.780000000001s)]
*  your team is like a week later being like, oh yeah, that's a circus over there [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6867.38s)]
*  basically, uh, and they get Levine back. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6870.5s)]
*  And Levine in a lot of these games just feels like almost an afterthought. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6873.9400000000005s)]
*  And, and, and he's averaging 21 a game, which is actually not a lot for him. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6879.18s)]
*  His assisted turnover ratio has gotten like perilously close to even with the [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6883.3s)]
*  Kings and it just feels like between DeRozan and Sabonis and now Monk coming [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6886.820000000001s)]
*  off the bench, I realized like for Levine to be worth it, he's not a great passer [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6891.54s)]
*  and he's a minus defender. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6897.740000000001s)]
*  He's got to take a lot of shots and it feels like he is sort of semi-predictably, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6899.02s)]
*  I guess, trying to feel out like, how do I fit in here or the coaches are trying [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6903.22s)]
*  to figure out that he just hasn't been the explosion of productivity that the [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6906.660000000001s)]
*  numbers in Chicago suggested he would be. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6911.58s)]
*  And, you know, don't you feel like the Kings and the Bulls are destined to keep, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6914.3s)]
*  just keep trading these guys among each other? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6918.38s)]
*  Maybe just trading with each other. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6920.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, this Kings thing now it's a decade and a half almost. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6922.0599999999995s)]
*  We did that Grantland draft room war room short when they let us behind the scenes. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6926.38s)]
*  Remember that it's on YouTube somewhere. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6931.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6932.7s)]
*  And then I'm taking Nick Stavskis and Vivek is kind of nudging people towards [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6933.0199999999995s)]
*  Stavskis and they all pretend they're excited about it. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6938.62s)]
*  Do they like sing or chant something on the phone? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6940.74s)]
*  They call and they're like one, two, three, something. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6943.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to make this quick. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6946.82s)]
*  My crossroads guys, Kawhi Leonard. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6948.219999999999s)]
*  And here's why. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6950.86s)]
*  He should be flattered to be still in a crossroads given his health situation. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6952.0199999999995s)]
*  And I love Kawhi. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6957.3s)]
*  So his bounce is there. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6958.0599999999995s)]
*  If you see it in person, I don't know how long it's going to last. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6961.139999999999s)]
*  And it's gotten to the point when he's out there with the other guys, they have [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6965.54s)]
*  the Cooper fans. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6969.3s)]
*  I think rightfully so, or like we can hang with any team in the league. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6970.42s)]
*  And the reason he's a crossroads thing is I think the Cooper fans are at the [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6973.58s)]
*  crossroads with that feeling. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6976.62s)]
*  This is now how over a half decade of, well, if Kawhi can just dot dot dot. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6980.5s)]
*  And I think this is it. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6987.219999999999s)]
*  And if, and if he gets hurt again or he falls apart in some way or he's not [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6988.58s)]
*  there or round one, all of a sudden game three, um, Shams is reprimanded. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6992.66s)]
*  Shams is reporting Kawhi Leonard is doubtful for tonight. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=6997.98s)]
*  I just don't think the Cooper fans want to do it again. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7001.179999999999s)]
*  This has been five years of this. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7003.339999999999s)]
*  So there it's a crossroads from a sense of, you can't realistically think you [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7006.099999999999s)]
*  can win the title if he's one of your highest paid guys and best guys in the [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7010.74s)]
*  team when he hasn't been able to make it through a season and a half decade. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7013.86s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7018.98s)]
*  You don't need to anything else. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7019.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7021.299999999999s)]
*  I had some, unless you have it, you go ahead. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7022.139999999999s)]
*  Well, I think the Paul George decision, which looks like a stroke of genius in [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7024.419999999999s)]
*  retrospect, even though they did offer him a three year a hundred, whatever, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7028.339999999999s)]
*  right, $50 million deal. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7031.299999999999s)]
*  Um, I remember talking about that and saying like, yeah, it's great. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7033.259999999999s)]
*  They've signed all these nice role players and, you know, hardens back. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7037.98s)]
*  And to make that decision signals to me that you don't think the team is presently [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7041.86s)]
*  contracted can win a championship. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7046.86s)]
*  If you thought it could win a championship, you'd go all in and they didn't go all in. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7048.139999999999s)]
*  So I don't think they entered this season necessarily expecting to be in this kind [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7051.22s)]
*  of conversation that we're talking about now of like, they can go toe to toe with [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7054.9800000000005s)]
*  people and here they are, they're a really well balanced team. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7057.660000000001s)]
*  Like I love, you know, uh, Powell and Chris Dunn go out and in comes another [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7060.9400000000005s)]
*  defender and Derek Jones Jr. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7065.26s)]
*  To replace Dunn and another score in Bogdanovich to replace Powell. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7066.620000000001s)]
*  I think my hottest Clipper take is that if each of Zubot's belongs, I don't think [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7070.620000000001s)]
*  he's going to make third team all NBA for me, but you need to have him on the list [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7075.46s)]
*  of guys that you've considered for 13 LNBA along with James Harden is making a late [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7078.78s)]
*  push. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7083.099999999999s)]
*  Is he making a late push for you? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7083.5s)]
*  It's making a push. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7085.099999999999s)]
*  I do the list every week. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7086.38s)]
*  He was on my third team this week. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7087.58s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to stay, but he's in there. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7089.0199999999995s)]
*  Great. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7091.34s)]
*  Do you have for a defensive stud? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7091.54s)]
*  That's a, that's a hole for you right now. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7093.139999999999s)]
*  Uh, that hasn't been picked. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7095.58s)]
*  Um, you can pick between Amin Thompson and OGN and OB. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7097.58s)]
*  Let's do Amin Thompson. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7102.099999999999s)]
*  What else? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7105.5s)]
*  The guy's an absolute freak. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7106.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, just the plays he makes are ridiculous. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7107.66s)]
*  Um, I couldn't like him anymore. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7110.9s)]
*  I don't care that every time in person this year, right? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7114.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7116.9s)]
*  I use it. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7117.34s)]
*  We were texting about it. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7117.7s)]
*  It's, it's different in person. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7118.78s)]
*  It's like, Oh, these guys are amazing athletes and yet he's a better athlete than [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7120.34s)]
*  all the amazing athletes. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7125.099999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7126.14s)]
*  I had a front office person, not rockets, uh, just yesterday, literally yesterday, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7126.86s)]
*  but I was talking about it because this is what I do. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7131.74s)]
*  I talk about Amin Thompson, I guess, said he's the best athlete in the NBA, full stop. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7133.38s)]
*  And his brother might be the second best athlete in the NBA. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7137.66s)]
*  So they're the best athletes in the NBA and they play the right way. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7140.0199999999995s)]
*  And he's just, we, we haven't seen one of those in a while where a guy comes off [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7143.82s)]
*  the bench, another guy gets hurt. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7149.62s)]
*  He gets elevated into the starting five and it's immediately clear that he's [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7151.3s)]
*  never coming off the bench again. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7154.3s)]
*  And this other guy, this other guy's, this other guy's not a starter anymore. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7155.34s)]
*  Uh, I'm going to use a second banana pick cause I have one and I'm going to take [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7159.58s)]
*  Jimmy Butler just cause I feel like he needs to be in any sort of most intriguing [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7163.66s)]
*  guys heading into the playoffs list. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7167.58s)]
*  Uh, it's been really fun to watch him. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7169.66s)]
*  I don't know what happened with Miami and I think blame goes every everywhere. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7172.1s)]
*  And it seemed to got really, really, really deeply, darkly personal with him [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7175.66s)]
*  and Pat Riley, um, about as personal as it's gotten with an executive and a [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7179.7s)]
*  player maybe ever, and I think it affected everything to the point where. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7184.66s)]
*  Both sides needed to move on and they did. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7189.5s)]
*  And he went to Golden state and he's clicked with Draymond and the [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7191.34s)]
*  Warriors took off immediately and it's prolonged steps prime. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7195.1s)]
*  And I can't wait to watch him in a playoff series again, because he's [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7199.26s)]
*  fucking awesome in the playoffs. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7202.14s)]
*  So where they land, we'll see who they're playing. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7203.9800000000005s)]
*  We don't know. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7207.42s)]
*  Um, but it's great to have them involved because I did not like this Miami version [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7208.660000000001s)]
*  of Jimmy this year was just felt like a wasted wasted talent this year. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7212.860000000001s)]
*  It's like, this guy's good. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7218.5s)]
*  He still has it in him. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7219.58s)]
*  We're just going to throw a season away for no reason. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7220.9400000000005s)]
*  So he is a, my second banana pig. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7223.1s)]
*  All right. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7225.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know if I did this correctly, but it seems like we only have two spots left. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7226.18s)]
*  I still need my leap guy and I'm going to give you a wild card back so we can get to 25. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7229.54s)]
*  And I just want to point out, we haven't taken, taken Nicole [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7235.740000000001s)]
*  Yocach yet in this intriguing thing. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7238.34s)]
*  So you have the floor. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7240.1s)]
*  You haven't been able to talk about them for five wild card wild card. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7241.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7244.3s)]
*  I'll give them to you as a wild card. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7244.660000000001s)]
*  I'm going to just dig right away from that and go with a related Jamal Murray. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7245.54s)]
*  Uh, Jamal Murray. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7251.700000000001s)]
*  Might be the biggest wild card in the NBA. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7253.3s)]
*  Um, the first two months of the season, plus the Olympics, plus the way last [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7256.14s)]
*  season ended was like, Oh, as great as the Yocach is as great as the Aaron Gordon [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7261.5s)]
*  fit is as steady as Michael Porter, Jr. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7267.54s)]
*  jumper is as improved as Christian Brown who belongs in the most improved [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7270.14s)]
*  player conversation to as approved as he is, they can't win for a playoff [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7273.700000000001s)]
*  series without Jamal Murray being the Jamal Murray who was the second best [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7278.18s)]
*  guy in the title team two years ago or something close to that. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7283.62s)]
*  And he's been pretty damn good now for the next two and a half months, a [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7286.700000000001s)]
*  little bit quieter lately than he was when he started really rolling and [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7290.3s)]
*  putting up thirties and forties. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7293.46s)]
*  And even I think he had a 50, um, they need, they need fully, if, if they have [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7294.9400000000005s)]
*  that guy, 28 a game, Jamal Murray killer, Jamal Murray, mid range assassin, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7300.5s)]
*  Jamal Murray, I wouldn't sleep on these guys. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7306.98s)]
*  I don't think they quite have enough to win the championship, even if they get [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7310.139999999999s)]
*  him, because I just think their bench is too much of a wild card and their [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7315.5s)]
*  defense hasn't been good enough. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7319.0599999999995s)]
*  But, but we know they're tough. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7320.66s)]
*  We know they have one of the greatest players of all time. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7324.0199999999995s)]
*  If not, maybe the best player I still would bring them the best player right [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7327.459999999999s)]
*  now, even if I didn't vote him MVP. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7330.5s)]
*  Um, if they get that Jamal Murray, I wouldn't be, wouldn't want to play them [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7332.660000000001s)]
*  if I were any of these teams, including Oklahoma city. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7337.38s)]
*  So we'll make Jamal and Yocage the co wild card. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7342.1s)]
*  So I mean, Yocage isn't a wild card. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7345.700000000001s)]
*  Yocage isn't a wild card, but I know exactly what I'm going to get from him [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7347.9400000000005s)]
*  almost every game and sometimes I'll get a 30, 20, 20, who knows. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7350.5s)]
*  I was thinking more wild card, like Yocage just rips through the west. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7354.9800000000005s)]
*  Beats. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7359.14s)]
*  Okay. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7359.46s)]
*  See by himself makes the finals again. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7359.740000000001s)]
*  And we're like, Oh my God, this is one of the eight greatest players of all time. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7361.860000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go with my last pick for the leap. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7366.820000000001s)]
*  Surprise day hasn't come up yet. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7372.26s)]
*  Talked about him a little on Sunday, Tyrese Albert. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7373.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'm so glad he brought up the Pacers. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7377.02s)]
*  So they're in that four or five spot against Detroit. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7380.38s)]
*  It looks like assuming Milwaukee stays in six. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7384.1s)]
*  And we all like Detroit. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7387.820000000001s)]
*  It's a feel good story, but I just think Indiana has a better team than them. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7389.38s)]
*  Detroit's going to try to muck it up and there's a chance we might be really [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7392.620000000001s)]
*  celebrating the 20th anniversary of the art test melee in an actual way with the [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7395.9400000000005s)]
*  same uniforms, maybe they wear the uniforms. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7399.780000000001s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7402.700000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7403.06s)]
*  Just, I, I'm just a little worried Detroit clearly loves, loves brawling and [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7403.18s)]
*  there was a traumatized kid in the wolves crowd. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7409.34s)]
*  They gave him a Jersey and he was like, yes, great. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7411.58s)]
*  Thanks for the jersey. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7414.34s)]
*  This guy was on time. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7417.18s)]
*  I just want to mention James Johnson's on the Pacers. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7417.780000000001s)]
*  So I'm prepared for anything in a Pacers piston series, but with Halliburton, the [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7422.5s)]
*  way he's played the last three months, he fully looks back to where he was the [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7428.820000000001s)]
*  first two months of the previous season. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7432.9400000000005s)]
*  There's a path here for him playing the pistons around one, going toe to toe with [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7436.26s)]
*  the Cavs in round two, where it's just like, we leave that series like, wow, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7439.9400000000005s)]
*  Halliburton has been the best guy through four games. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7444.82s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7448.0599999999995s)]
*  Are the Pacers going to beat the Cavs? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7448.66s)]
*  They could just run up and down the way the Cavs defense has been the last month [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7450.62s)]
*  or so there's some vulnerabilities. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7453.62s)]
*  Um, I guess my question is how good is Halburn? [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7456.139999999999s)]
*  Is there a level for him to go up in the playoffs was last year, just a [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7461.86s)]
*  fluke of injuries and, um, the fact that the East wasn't deep and they stuck into [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7466.54s)]
*  the Eastern finals and it didn't mean anything, or did that actually mean a [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7472.38s)]
*  little more than we realized? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7475.54s)]
*  I'm just intrigued. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7477.38s)]
*  So I have him as my possible leap guy. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7478.26s)]
*  Love it. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7480.78s)]
*  He's on, he's on third team all NBA for me right now on the ballot that I don't [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7481.74s)]
*  have, he's played even above that for quite a bit of the season now. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7485.78s)]
*  Um, they're just a really good team. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7491.06s)]
*  I mean, I, I don't have their schedule in front of me, but they start, they [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7493.26s)]
*  were under 500, maybe 20 games into the season or thereabouts and since then [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7496.06s)]
*  have been a legit, very good team. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7499.7s)]
*  The Cav series would be interesting. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7503.86s)]
*  The Cavs are a little bigger than they are on the front line, but the [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7505.34s)]
*  Siakam is really good. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7509.78s)]
*  Turner's good. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7510.82s)]
*  Obie Toppin feels like he has missed a shot in a month now. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7511.46s)]
*  Um, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7515.58s)]
*  yeah, there's like 10 years ago, Obie Toppin is in the running for six man of [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7516.26s)]
*  the year because we had way less six better the year candidates and we're like, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7519.98s)]
*  Hey, what about, we're just trying to talk ourselves into candidates. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7523.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, he comes in and swings games every once in a while. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7525.98s)]
*  Look, they've got Turner's free agency hanging over their head. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7529.0599999999995s)]
*  Um, and the tax implications of that someone I saw, I've seen a suggestion [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7532.139999999999s)]
*  where they could just dump Obie Toppin. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7536.099999999999s)]
*  Like that guy's good. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7537.38s)]
*  He's been good for their team. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7538.26s)]
*  I would dumping Obie Toppin is there's pain. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7539.38s)]
*  They're just a, they're a rock solid team. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7542.86s)]
*  And if you're not healthy or you're don't bring your A game, they can beat you [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7545.66s)]
*  four times in seven games and Halliburton is just a guaranteed good offense by [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7549.5s)]
*  almost by himself. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7553.58s)]
*  I just realized what the category is that I put Luca down twice for you and that [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7555.06s)]
*  Yocage can be your legacy guy. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7559.9s)]
*  So moving in here, here's where we landed. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7561.5s)]
*  Apex superstar. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7565.94s)]

*  Step Curry for you. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7582.82s)]
*  Donovan Mitchell for me. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7585.0199999999995s)]
*  Hot seat coach. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7586.34s)]

*  Whoa, hot seat wild card. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7594.46s)]

*  I went with Julius Randall. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7602.099999999999s)]

*  Second banana. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7607.42s)]
*  You took Jaylen Williams and Chet Hormigan together. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7608.66s)]
*  I allowed it. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7611.0599999999995s)]
*  I took Jimmy Butler third banana. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7611.78s)]
*  Austin Reeves for me. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7613.62s)]
*  Levine for you. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7614.46s)]

*  And then a wild card pick, which I gave to you so we could get to 25. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7623.74s)]
*  Jamal Murray. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7629.58s)]
*  That gimmick actually worked. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7630.62s)]
*  Covered a lot, covered a lot of ground. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7633.099999999999s)]
*  I'm really glad to face you. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7634.3s)]
*  You know, we said that we didn't pick, we didn't pick LeBron James. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7635.3s)]
*  Maybe we should put him as another wild card. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7638.38s)]
*  We talked about him a lot though. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7639.94s)]

*  We don't even need to have him in there. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7653.74s)]
*  But I'm sure. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dGSjti6R0&t=7655.219999999999s)]
