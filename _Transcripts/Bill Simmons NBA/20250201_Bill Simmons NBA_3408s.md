# Luka Doncic Traded to the Lakers? For Anthony Davis? Why Dallas Why??? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE)
*  The most shocking trade, I think in the history of the NBA, at least from a shock [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=0.0s)]
*  value, oh my God, is this real? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=6.4s)]
*  Has shams been hacked? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=8.52s)]
*  What, what, what is happening? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=10.28s)]
*  Rob Mahoney is here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=12.36s)]
*  Ryan Rosso is here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  It took me about 10 minutes to figure out. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=14.76s)]
*  Was this real? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=17.56s)]
*  And then Shams, obviously he had to retweet. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=18.16s)]
*  No, no, this is real. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=20.96s)]
*  Uh, Mahoney, you, you followed Dallas pretty closely. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=23.52s)]
*  Was there any sign whatsoever that Luca was on the block? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Not like this, at least that I heard you hear burbling with players of his caliber [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=30.68s)]
*  all the time of like, oh, if he, if it ever got to the point, then maybe the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=35.0s)]
*  Lakers or a team like that would be consulted if it ever reached a certain [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=39.32s)]
*  threshold, but this is, I'm completely blindsided by this as apparently as most [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  of the league, including many of the players in it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Rossello. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I was getting texts and then I was like checking with people and then [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=51.44s)]
*  with Bobby Marks was like, Hey, this is real. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=54.72s)]
*  Like Shams had to say, I'm not hacked above it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  And then Bobby Marks above that had to be like, this is real because the headline [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=59.8s)]
*  of it is that it makes no fucking sense at all and whatever we're, you know, we're [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=64.44s)]
*  going to go all over the place and try to figure it out, but like you have. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=69.72s)]
*  Traded at worst, the third best player in the NBA and when he's right, probably [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=74.28s)]
*  the second best guy and you've traded them at this age and you've completely [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=79.28s)]
*  reset the Lakers in a way that is basically impossible. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=84.2s)]
*  So it doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=88.52s)]
*  So my here's my cycle. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=91.2s)]
*  As I went through it, somebody forwarded me the tweet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=93.8s)]
*  I thought it was one of those MBAs sent tell. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=96.52s)]
*  Oh no, somebody's messing around. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=99.64s)]
*  Then you click on it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=101.52s)]
*  They would have Ronnie in it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=102.28s)]
*  True. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=105.0s)]
*  So then you click on it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=105.72s)]
*  It's actually Sean's his actual account. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=106.72s)]
*  Then the next thing is, well, this, he had to have been hacked because if you're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=108.44s)]
*  actually making a trade of Luca Donchich and Anthony Davis, the Lakers would be [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=112.08s)]
*  giving up more stuff. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=115.96s)]
*  It wouldn't just be the 20, 29 first. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=117.12s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=119.8s)]
*  I would have been in 20, 31 first. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=120.44s)]
*  There would have been pick swaps. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=122.48s)]
*  And then over the next 10 minutes, it just started to seem like it was real. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=124.6s)]
*  And that's when I think probably all of us were getting the text. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=128.28s)]
*  You start going on Twitter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=130.68s)]
*  There's confirmation stuff on Twitter. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=132.52s)]
*  And it's like, I guess that's it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=134.2s)]
*  I guess the Lakers just basically hijacked Luca Donchich. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=136.04s)]
*  Rob, here's this team that over and over again has found ways to reinvent itself [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=139.96s)]
*  over the last 60 years, really going back to when they were able to get Will [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Chamberlain in the end of the, you know, the late sixties and then Kareem in the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=148.4s)]
*  seventies and they pull off magic Johnson in the eighties Shaq and Kobe show up in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=151.84s)]
*  the nineties. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=156.96s)]
*  And this just Palgasol in 2008, LeBron miraculously out of nowhere in 18. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=157.72s)]
*  And then this, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=163.8s)]
*  this is almost a totally different level than any of those things. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=165.88s)]
*  I think just because of the pure shock value, because it is a superstar, not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  even yet in his prime. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  And we're already starting to see the information filter out from Dallas about [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=175.0s)]
*  why this could have possibly happened. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=178.48s)]
*  I, I'm, I am as stunned as anybody. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=180.92s)]
*  And I don't think there is any justifiable explanation for trading a player as [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=183.56s)]
*  good as Luca right now, unless he, he has come to the maps and said, I don't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=186.76s)]
*  want to be here anymore. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=191.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=192.28s)]
*  So he had a year and a half left in his deal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=192.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=194.6s)]
*  And there may be, there were discussions behind the scene that, that I'm out of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=194.96s)]
*  here after my contracts up at the end of 26. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=199.6s)]
*  So if you can get something for me now, but that raises the biggest question, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=202.2s)]
*  this whole thing, if you're going to trade Luca, why not shop them? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=206.6s)]
*  What can you get for them? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=210.84s)]
*  Why not actually try to really come through? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=212.0s)]
*  I don't, do you get that part? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=214.28s)]
*  Rossella? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=215.72s)]
*  Why wouldn't they have shopped them to at least like three, four teams? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=216.2s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=219.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm texting with teams right now and hopefully I'll get some responses [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=220.84s)]
*  here throughout the show on just, you know, did you know that he was available? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=224.2s)]
*  I'll never forget like teams reaching out just to be pissed off. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=227.92s)]
*  It's not like they wanted to talk to me that bad when Gasol was traded there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=231.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  And I know people have debated about whether or not he was available and all [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  this kind of different stuff, but like when the actual trade went through, there [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  were other teams being like, we, we, we had no idea that it was like coming to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=240.56s)]
*  this point, um, and you know, it's, it's not just cause it's the Lakers thing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  There was a lot of stuff going on at the time that you can kind of read the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=249.32s)]
*  tea leaves of like how it all came together, but this is not enough of a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=252.56s)]
*  hall, like if you were shopping them, you would do better than this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=256.16s)]
*  So unless it was like you guys said, like Luke could go on, Hey, look, I'm. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=261.2s)]
*  That's the only place I want to go. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=266.36s)]
*  But you know, we didn't even go through the cycle. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=268.6s)]
*  We didn't even go through all this stuff that we're used to like, Oh, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=270.44s)]
*  this guy already wants it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=273.88s)]
*  So even if he wanted out, then it's like, so what was the hurry? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  If this is the return and on top of everything else, like, look, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't think Dallas was a very good matchup against Boston. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=282.56s)]
*  That's a good basketball team. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=284.84s)]
*  And if everybody's healthy and what they've done and drafting lively, the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=286.52s)]
*  Gaffer Washington stuff, Kyrie, which by the way, like does the Kyrie alarm start [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=291.16s)]
*  going off here, like, are we back on the clock for like where, what he's thinking [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=297.0s)]
*  about next? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=300.48s)]
*  Cause he was finally like basketball happy again here for a year and a half. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=301.32s)]
*  So yeah, my point would be, okay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=304.36s)]
*  So say Luca, cause we'll find out more about this stuff. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=306.48s)]
*  And I wonder if there's like a Dallas hit piece coming, like the old Boston [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=309.08s)]
*  stuff used to happen with a guy and the Red Sox would go somewhere else. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=311.92s)]
*  And then two days later, red socks. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=314.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=317.44s)]
*  The Brian Curtis. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  Now you tell us deal. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=318.44s)]
*  So I don't know if that's coming, but I just, my overall thing, I'm sorry, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm going long here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  It's just that, okay, fine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=324.72s)]
*  If Luca was forcing your hand, why not just play it out this season? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=326.44s)]
*  If you're healthy, the West is not as deep as good as okay. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=331.48s)]
*  C is all the depth behind. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=334.64s)]
*  It's not what we thought it would be this summer. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  You just made the NBA finals. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=338.16s)]
*  He's 25 years old. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=339.48s)]
*  He's 26 in February. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=341.0s)]
*  You have them under contract the year after that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=342.44s)]
*  There's a player option. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  Like you would have done better. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=345.08s)]
*  Like this deal was not so like, oh, we have to do this right now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=347.0s)]
*  We're talking about 80, the 29. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=350.88s)]
*  Um, what is it? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=353.88s)]
*  They got, they got rid of, uh, I guess some Kleber Marquis Morris money. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=355.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  I actually thought Max Christie was just having him thrown in there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=359.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, Max Christie's not like nothing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=363.32s)]
*  No, he was pretty good. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=365.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=367.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=367.84s)]
*  Um, but so I didn't buy trade. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=368.4s)]
*  I did my trade value rankings and I put up the thing on Thursday and I had [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=370.96s)]
*  Luca, a big thing for me was trying to decide whether I should move SGA ahead [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  of Luca and I didn't feel great about it, but Luca has been hurt. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  Luca had the year and a half left in his deal. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  And I was just like, I, I just think SGA is seems like slightly more untradable [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=384.56s)]
*  than me, but I had Luca fourth at Davis 11th Davis is 31. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=390.24s)]
*  So he's six years older. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  Davis already just got hurt a week ago. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=395.76s)]
*  He's been up and down the whole time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=397.52s)]
*  And I just think these are two different classes of players as great as Davis is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=399.68s)]
*  There's Luca SGA, Yocage, Yanis Tatum. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=404.0s)]
*  And now we're starting to drop a little bit to some other next level of person. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=411.56s)]
*  You could win the finals with Luca as your best guy, if you can put the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=415.4s)]
*  right people around them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=419.0s)]
*  So I guess the questions that we're going to have Rob coming out of this are, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=420.2s)]
*  was the Luca Dallas situation worse than leaked out? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=423.84s)]
*  Did Luca tell them I'm going to the Lakers in a year and a half. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=428.68s)]
*  So just trade me there now. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=433.88s)]
*  If you trade me anywhere else, I'm still going to go to the Lakers and we'll [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=435.08s)]
*  tell the team that's about to trade. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=437.4s)]
*  Is it, was there more gamesmanship behind the scenes or was this Dallas [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=439.68s)]
*  and the Lakers just stealth going, Hey, what about if you did this trade? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=443.12s)]
*  And like neither side had any idea. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=447.12s)]
*  I'm already scared of the, the galaxy braining effect of what is going to happen [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=449.92s)]
*  as a result of this, because it does make you want to believe in a conspiracy [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=454.76s)]
*  theory. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=458.92s)]
*  The fact that this has been buttoned up clearly to the point that it shocked the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=459.36s)]
*  entire league, shocked the basketball landscape. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=462.56s)]
*  I, I am, I am stunned that it got to this point. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=465.36s)]
*  I'm, you know, even if you consider in the trade value that you just laid out, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=468.52s)]
*  Bill, none of those other guys are going to be available. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  None of those other guys are going to be on the market. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=475.08s)]
*  So if you are going to trade Luca, it's going to be for someone in that next [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=476.92s)]
*  class, the Anthony Davis class of player, but you would think there would be more [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=480.44s)]
*  to it than this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=484.2s)]
*  You would think that there would be more supplementary pieces involved. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=485.0s)]
*  And that that's where all of this seems to have come together so fast. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=488.08s)]
*  And I'm with you, like the, the acceleration from whatever instigating event, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  whether it was Luca coming to the Mavs or otherwise from there to here. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't understand why that period of time was fast tracked to the degree that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  it was there's we still have days left before the deadline. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=501.96s)]
*  Our friend Mark Stein is reporting. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=504.84s)]
*  Luca Donchich did not request the trade. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=507.4s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  Did this on their own accord. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=511.64s)]
*  So do you think Luca was just home? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=514.36s)]
*  Like he was watching night agent season two and it was like the phone rang. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=518.36s)]
*  It's Nico Harrison. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=522.96s)]
*  I have some bad news. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=524.56s)]
*  We've traded you to the Lakers. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=525.76s)]
*  Like, I wonder if he was blindsided by this. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=527.12s)]
*  I just refuse to believe in this league that is so beholden the players and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=529.76s)]
*  player relationships that a, that a superstar would be blindsided. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=533.36s)]
*  He had to have had some idea, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=538.64s)]
*  Rusella. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=540.4s)]
*  I'm now confused by this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=542.6s)]
*  No, you would think you'd think there had to have been something. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=544.0s)]
*  What would have motivated them to want to get rid? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=547.52s)]
*  Like, even if we play out, well, you know, he does get hurt. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  He doesn't take care of his body comes in out of shape. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=552.8s)]
*  You know, there's all this stuff with him. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=555.76s)]
*  It's like, dude, okay, fine. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=557.12s)]
*  And he still might be the second best player in the world. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=559.28s)]
*  No, I would, I would have, I actually have like a bit of a line of like [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=561.68s)]
*  Yolkich, which I don't think is really. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=564.68s)]
*  Obtainable at this point for any other player. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=567.4s)]
*  And then it kind of goes back and forth between Giannis and Luca. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=569.96s)]
*  And then I do have SGA fourths, you know, even with the numbers, I just think that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=573.52s)]
*  there's, there's a slightly different ceiling with some of those guys, maybe [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=576.76s)]
*  just cause I've seen Luca do it in the playoffs where it's like, there's really [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=580.84s)]
*  nothing to do with that guy once he just decides he's going to drive and go slow [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=584.64s)]
*  and get you on his hip, it seriously, I've called it like the best look that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=588.48s)]
*  you'll get in basketball. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=593.0s)]
*  Like if you just sort it all out and go, I need the best look that I feel just [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=594.24s)]
*  the best about as soon as the guy has the ball in his hands, it's that with [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=598.92s)]
*  his passing and his size. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=602.32s)]
*  So like, even if, cause somebody will do it, like somebody will do the, well, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=603.72s)]
*  you know, they were worried about how he was going to be later on his crew. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=609.6s)]
*  You go, okay, worry about that when he's 30 and you have to worry about the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=614.28s)]
*  extension, he's not even in his prime yet by, by NBA standards, which is 27, 28. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=617.68s)]
*  Bobby marks, you know, points out astutely that he was in line for a massive [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=623.8800000000001s)]
*  extension this summer for five years, 345 million. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=629.2800000000001s)]
*  And, you know, as I started thinking, okay, but I mean, as the cap goes up, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=633.1600000000001s)]
*  like that, that looks like Jaylen Brown's deal was the deal where you're like, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=637.96s)]
*  that's, that's insane. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=641.8800000000001s)]
*  It's also Jaylen Brown and not Luca, but you know, like every year we go through [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=642.96s)]
*  the cycle of deals where you're thinking you're paying 200 million for that guy. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=646.7600000000001s)]
*  And it's like, dude, in two years, these guys are beginning three, 350 million. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  Now Bobby says he's not going to be eligible for that now. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=654.64s)]
*  So that changes up some things. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=657.4799999999999s)]
*  The only thing I was thinking was, you know, I always thought the Cuban [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=659.52s)]
*  ownership thing was really weird. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  That this is somebody that has enjoyed being an owner in sports more than any [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=664.4799999999999s)]
*  person, maybe in any sport. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  This is somebody who nine years ago said, you know, um, what is it? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=670.1199999999999s)]
*  Pigs get fed and hogs get slaughtered when he talked about the NFL. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=675.3599999999999s)]
*  And granted, he was basically pumping up his own product, like going on TV, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=679.5600000000001s)]
*  talking about a position you have in a company when you own all their stock, but [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  he was basically dogging the NFL's future while he was propping up the NBA's [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=686.32s)]
*  future. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=691.1600000000001s)]
*  And that was nine years ago where he was like, it's, it's going to happen. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=692.0s)]
*  It's going, and it hasn't happened. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=694.5200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=695.48s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=695.6400000000001s)]
*  But is there anything to this that it was, it was still very, remember two like, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=696.5200000000001s)]
*  oh yeah, we don't own the team anymore, but we're still going to run it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=701.4000000000001s)]
*  Like, oh yeah, right. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  Because that's what billionaires love to do is buy things and let other people [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=704.6s)]
*  make all these decisions. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=708.2s)]
*  Um, but I think you think it was the new owners potentially not wanting to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=709.6s)]
*  pay the three 50. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=712.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=714.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=715.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm, I'm so shocked by this guys that like it crossed my mind. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=716.08s)]
*  Could it be any new owner thing where, but apparently people really like, like [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  think that this group is, they're not going to screw around with it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=724.88s)]
*  So, you know, you have a whole lot of thought though. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=727.6s)]
*  So three 50, I didn't see, I didn't think he was in like the greatest shape this [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  year. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=735.48s)]
*  Would you agree, Rob? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=735.6400000000001s)]
*  Agree. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=736.6400000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say he was, um, guys who cares? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=736.92s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=740.0799999999999s)]
*  Like I'm just trying to figure out from their perspective. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=740.52s)]
*  They're worried about, Hey, what's going on with this dude? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=743.16s)]
*  He's he doesn't seem like the light bulbs going off. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=746.28s)]
*  He's we're hearing rumors. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  Maybe he wants to leave unless we give him the 350 million. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=750.92s)]
*  Should we do it? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  With all that said, I'm raising my hand for the people listening. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=755.64s)]
*  I just would never trade them. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=758.68s)]
*  Never. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=760.04s)]
*  I, I, I just wouldn't like I would trade them for Wembee. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  I would trade them for a yolkage. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=764.64s)]
*  I would trade it for SGA and that's it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=766.92s)]
*  There's no other player, unless I'm also getting like five, six first round picks. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=768.7199999999999s)]
*  And when you think this is a league where Michael bridges went for five first [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=772.8s)]
*  rounders or a couple of years ago, KD went for, what was that? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=775.8s)]
*  Four first rounders, two swaps, Michael bridges and cam Johnson. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=779.4s)]
*  This just isn't enough for Luca. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=783.88s)]
*  And I think that's why like David Aldridge tweeted, he's been covering the NBA 37 [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=785.8s)]
*  years. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=789.7199999999999s)]
*  Um, nothing that happens deals for agent signings, coach hiring fires rises to the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=790.8s)]
*  level of as the great Ben Bradley used to call them a holy shit stories. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=795.0s)]
*  This is a holy shit trade. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=798.32s)]
*  I think it's bigger than that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=800.0s)]
*  I, the only thing I can think of, I think it's a holy fucking shit trade. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=801.76s)]
*  I, the only thing I can think of is that night when all hell broke loose and Paul [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=808.04s)]
*  George and Kawhi ended up on the Quippers. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=812.52s)]
*  But at least then we were on kind of call that week. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=815.24s)]
*  We knew something was happening. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=818.0s)]
*  We were waiting to see where it was going to go. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=819.52s)]
*  We were trying to figure out where Kawhi's kids were registered for school. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=821.88s)]
*  Like we were on call. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=824.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=826.16s)]
*  We're on call like doctors. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a Saturday night. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=827.3599999999999s)]
*  The Lakers just played. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=828.76s)]
*  LeBron looked fantastic against the Knicks. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=830.4s)]
*  Davis was supposed to come back in a couple of days. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=832.52s)]
*  There was no sign whatsoever. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=835.12s)]
*  And we all thought a Shams got hacked. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=836.8s)]
*  So as far as since we've all been working together, it's the most shocking NBA [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=839.4s)]
*  trade that I'd have to go through history. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=844.1999999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine a bigger one. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=846.12s)]
*  Well, and in that case with Paul George and Kawhi, like Kawhi was on the market. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=847.7199999999999s)]
*  So there were the pre court precursors. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=851.52s)]
*  There's no market for Luka Doncic. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=853.48s)]
*  I was under the impression, frankly, with the way the NBA has been operating over [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=855.76s)]
*  the last five or 10 years, that a player of this caliber would just never be traded [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=859.44s)]
*  again without a demand or request of some kind on their part. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=863.12s)]
*  And if that really is what happened, that this is entirely preemptive by the maps. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=866.76s)]
*  Granted, maybe they are reading the tea leaves about the extension. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=870.84s)]
*  Maybe they are forecasting and saying, you know, a year and a half from now, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=874.08s)]
*  we're going to have to deal with this in a way that doesn't look good for us. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=877.32s)]
*  Every other team in these instances holds on too long and ends up driving down some [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=880.36s)]
*  of the value and a potential trade. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=885.12s)]
*  The fact that the Mavs jumped the line on that market and still came away with what [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=887.1600000000001s)]
*  feels to be such low value for a player of Luka's caliber. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=892.08s)]
*  Why, why are you preempting it? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=895.88s)]
*  Like, why are you getting ahead of yourself and doing something that no other team is [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=897.6s)]
*  willing to do in part because no other team pretty much has a player as good as Luka. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=901.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, and you're also, now you have this team that's built around Kyrie, who is [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  2010 draft, 2011 draft. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=909.6s)]
*  So he's in his early thirties. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=913.12s)]
*  Davis was 2012 draft. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  He's 31. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=916.72s)]
*  So you have this older team that's kind of built to win right now, but it doesn't [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=918.12s)]
*  have the, uh, the long-term ceiling. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=921.76s)]
*  I don't think of what they had before. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=924.6s)]
*  So Bobby Marks said Luka was in line for five for 3 45 this summer. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=926.96s)]
*  He was super max eligible being on the same team. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=932.52s)]
*  That's out the window now, cause he got traded. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=934.48s)]
*  So this actually cost him money. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=937.0s)]
*  Um, I, Rossello, can we, can we just, I'm still wrapping my head around this. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=939.6s)]
*  Can we talk about the Dallas piece of this? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=946.36s)]
*  Does Dallas think this made their team better? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=949.12s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=952.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm still reading stuff like Shams has another post here that says, quote, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=953.28s)]
*  the Mavericks approach the Lakers recently and offered Luka Donchich sources tell [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=957.0s)]
*  ESPN Lakers brass met and believe the 25 year old Donchich has the ability to be [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=960.88s)]
*  the face of the franchise for the next decade while giving Anthony Davis a win [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=965.96s)]
*  now move in Dallas. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=969.32s)]
*  The best is like the last sentence, like, Hey, say something nice about something [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=970.24s)]
*  nice about Anthony Davis on the way out of here. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  I love the idea that they, they got the call and then we're like, all right, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=977.32s)]
*  let's, let's kick around some thoughts. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=980.2s)]
*  You know, how many, how many opposed, you know, uh, you know, they must've [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=983.0s)]
*  thought that they were getting fucked with when that, that call first happens. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=989.0s)]
*  Um, but yeah, on the Dallas side, you're right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=992.72s)]
*  Well, don't you think they, if you get that call and you're almost like, am I [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  being pranked? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=997.7199999999999s)]
*  Is my phone tapped? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=998.4799999999999s)]
*  Are they trying to like, they can't, they can't possibly be actually trying [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1000.16s)]
*  to trade Luka Donchich to us. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1003.68s)]
*  Or what's wrong with them? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1006.3599999999999s)]
*  Like what happened to Luka that they would even want to trade him in the first place? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1007.3599999999999s)]
*  It's like the put when Paul Pierce dropped to 10 in the 98 draft and he hit around [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1011.0s)]
*  like pick six and all the Celtics were like, what happened? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1014.88s)]
*  Is he, is he, was he arrested? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  Like why is he dropping? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1021.3599999999999s)]
*  Uh, Rossello, how about this? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1022.8399999999999s)]
*  Dave McBenneman just tweeted. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1024.28s)]
*  LeBron learned of the Davis Donchich trade after the next game. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1026.32s)]
*  He was out to dinner with his family. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1029.52s)]
*  Sources close to James told ESPN he was surprised by the news as processing [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1031.68s)]
*  it, had no idea it was in the works. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  Sources said, I actually believe that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1037.6s)]
*  Because I think if any of this even came close to leaking out beyond like the, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1040.84s)]
*  the immediate people that were involved in it, I think it would have leaked out. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1045.36s)]
*  That's one of the shocking things about this is that none of this leaked out. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1048.68s)]
*  No. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1051.84s)]
*  I mean, it can't happen, but that also, I think speaks to the speed of what this [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1052.24s)]
*  was because if it, if they had reached out, say two weeks ago, I think eventually [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1055.92s)]
*  somebody figures it out. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1060.96s)]
*  I would say though, like if clutch knew because granted Davis is their client [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1062.36s)]
*  in this, um, they, I don't think that they would have leaked. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1067.12s)]
*  Like what would have been the purpose? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1071.12s)]
*  Like you wouldn't want anyone to even know about any of this stuff. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1072.36s)]
*  Because they would have told LeBron. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1074.76s)]
*  They tell LeBron and then you don't know what happens if you tell him, like what [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1076.24s)]
*  if LeBron doesn't want the trade that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1079.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1080.76s)]
*  If you're LeBron, it's like, I mean, that's, there's so many pieces to talk about this, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1081.16s)]
*  but now we have LeBron, James and Luca Dacic on the same team. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1084.8s)]
*  Lucas had the best, I don't know what seven years start to a career that any [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1088.28s)]
*  player has had since LeBron has been on all the same, and now they're going to be [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  on the same team, which is like, like that has only happened a couple of times in [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1096.6s)]
*  the history of the league where it's like, Hey, Wilt's now going to be on the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1101.12s)]
*  team with Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1104.48s)]
*  You know, like we just don't have super smart players. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1107.08s)]
*  We don't have superstar, super duper star pairings out of nowhere like this. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1109.96s)]
*  And I honestly don't know how they fit. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1115.52s)]
*  I think it's a pretty weird fit, the two of them. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1117.04s)]
*  You know what though, like that used to be something I used to always think about [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1118.92s)]
*  when they would say Chris Paul and LeBron really want to play, play with each other. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1121.48s)]
*  And when they were at their peaks, I always thought it was a little stupid. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1125.24s)]
*  Cause I just felt like it was redundant. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  It was taking away what, what both of their greatness was. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1130.76s)]
*  It was just setting everything up and reading it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1134.2s)]
*  And when they were both in their primes, I'm like, why would they actually, I don't [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1136.32s)]
*  know that that makes a ton of sense. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1138.76s)]
*  Now, when you watch the Lakers and you think about their best possessions, like [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1139.8799999999999s)]
*  they were so good tonight, man, their spacing and the way LeBron was reading [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1144.12s)]
*  everything, but a lot of times like Austin Reeves now post Angelo Russell's [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1148.36s)]
*  tasked with having to figure out a way to set up their offense. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1152.0s)]
*  Cause I think he's, he just has the energy to do it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1155.8s)]
*  LeBron doesn't have the energy to play point guard the entire time. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1158.16s)]
*  And then on the other side of it, as good as Reeves has been, he's the number one [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  hunt target for the other team's best player, and they're trying to get him [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1163.6s)]
*  into every single switch. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1167.12s)]
*  So it's just an exhausting role for Reeves to have all that stuff. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1168.36s)]
*  And it was the best version of him based on who they had. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1171.84s)]
*  But now with Luca, like at this stage at 40 for LeBron, this is great for him. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1175.04s)]
*  This is, this is fine. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1179.84s)]
*  Now we could talk about their defense because they were always trying [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1181.52s)]
*  to figure out their defense. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1184.36s)]
*  The Luka, LeBron and Austin Reeves all at the same time, three of your five guys. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1185.6399999999999s)]
*  And no, no, no, no, no, no protection. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1189.8s)]
*  Jackson Hayes is still out right now on the East coast. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1192.4399999999998s)]
*  He's like extension baby. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1195.08s)]
*  Jackson Hayes is like, finally. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1197.12s)]
*  You know what it is though? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1199.1999999999998s)]
*  It kind of, I mean, is it worth, is it worth going like, you know, immediately [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1200.1999999999998s)]
*  unless there's some more moves, they are kind of a weird team and the Lakers [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1206.2399999999998s)]
*  and ownership are like, fuck it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1210.2399999999998s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1211.9599999999998s)]
*  Of course they said who cares because now we have arguably the second best [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  player in the world at 25 years old. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1217.28s)]
*  Now you do this every time. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1219.04s)]
*  You just do it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1220.36s)]
*  You don't even, you don't even blink. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1221.36s)]
*  But it could play out for a team that's been playing better. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1225.16s)]
*  And again, you don't make decisions based on how a team's playing for two weeks, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1229.76s)]
*  but it could play out that it becomes more of a reset year than a, what if we [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1232.56s)]
*  get lucky in the right playoff matchups? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1237.56s)]
*  And next thing you know, we're in the Western conference finals, even though [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1239.76s)]
*  I think that that was still unlikely going up against some of these other [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1242.0s)]
*  teams that like better in the West. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1245.08s)]
*  I don't know that we could completely write it off. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1247.04s)]
*  This is. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1249.52s)]
*  No, cause they also might have another trade for some, for some sort of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1250.76s)]
*  rim protection. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1254.16s)]
*  They need a big, they need somebody. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1254.76s)]
*  I'll say this, man. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1257.0s)]
*  I, I don't think that's valence Eunice as far as rim protection. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1258.1200000000001s)]
*  That's not what you want. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1261.16s)]
*  No, but maybe it's like a raw Robert Williams. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1262.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't know if he would be able to stay in the court, but it's that kind [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1265.3200000000002s)]
*  of level, like the 10, $11 million center who can stay near the rim. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1267.88s)]
*  I'll say this, this team would like, I'm just, it's breaking my brain thinking [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1271.96s)]
*  about it, but LeBron, the way he's looked tonight and a couple of the games [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1276.52s)]
*  recently where he's, he's really, really, really, really good and efficient. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1280.0s)]
*  And some of the choices he's making and the way they were spreading the floor [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1285.48s)]
*  for him, like he was just annihilated the next night. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1288.3600000000001s)]
*  And then you think about that with Luca and those guys spread out playing off [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1291.08s)]
*  each other with the offense spread. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1295.72s)]
*  Like it's, well, it's not nothing, Rob. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1297.96s)]
*  I'm looking at the Laker odds right now in Fandel. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1300.68s)]
*  They have the six best odds now to win the title at 21 to one. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1303.0s)]
*  So people are wagering on this, Rob. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1307.28s)]
*  They still need a lot of work in terms of that front court. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1310.48s)]
*  They, I mean, just as we said, playable bodies, the Christian [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1312.8s)]
*  Coloco Jackson Hayes thing that is, that's not going to get it done. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1315.48s)]
*  These are small potatoes problems in the scope of when you bring in [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1319.04s)]
*  Luca Donjic ultimately having two supercomputers on the court is just [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1321.8400000000001s)]
*  going to give the Laker something that literally no other team in the league [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1326.24s)]
*  has and the selective deployment of LeBron that we've been talking about [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1328.8400000000001s)]
*  where he can now pick his spots at a level that he's never been able to [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1332.32s)]
*  before, and he was someone who played with prime Dwyane Wade. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1335.56s)]
*  And so that in itself puts them in such a unique space that is frankly [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1338.04s)]
*  unquantifiable in terms of what the title race is. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1343.16s)]
*  I, I will rule nothing out at this point. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1346.24s)]
*  Like Lakers exceptionalism clearly is the thing that exists. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1348.3600000000001s)]
*  And we need to acknowledge that they can move the pieces around the board [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1351.48s)]
*  in ways that no other team can. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1354.64s)]
*  There are big markets. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1356.04s)]
*  Dallas is one of the biggest markets in the league. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1357.4s)]
*  There are massive markets that operate in their own ways. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  And then there is the Lakers in their own zone of existence, making shit [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1362.3600000000001s)]
*  like that, this happened on a regular basis. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1365.44s)]
*  From a hunting the, the weak link on the other team's standpoint, this is kind [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1368.3200000000002s)]
*  of a nightmare now with, with Luca and LeBron, if they can actually figure [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1373.64s)]
*  it out how to kind of balance that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1377.16s)]
*  And there's, there's always going to be somebody who are like, Oh, you're going [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1379.96s)]
*  to, that's who you're going to have on him. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1382.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1384.96s)]
*  And if they can figure that they still need some room protection. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1385.8400000000001s)]
*  I, Rossello. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1389.24s)]
*  Yeah, but we both know, like we don't even need to say it, but maybe [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1390.6000000000001s)]
*  we'll just say it one more time. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1393.2s)]
*  Like, I think the point is, is even if they feel like they can't fix [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1394.16s)]
*  themselves, none of it matters. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1398.1200000000001s)]
*  You still do it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1399.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1400.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1400.52s)]
*  So Rossello, here's the question for you. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1400.76s)]
*  What else would you have thrown into this trade from the Lakers side before [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1404.5600000000002s)]
*  you said yes, if you were Dallas? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1409.72s)]
*  The trade they already made, if you were the Dallas GM, what more would [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1412.76s)]
*  you have had to get? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1417.6000000000001s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1418.5600000000002s)]
*  There would have, there would not have been a trade. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1419.0400000000002s)]
*  I would have gone to a different team. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1420.92s)]
*  I would have asked for all their picks. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1422.4s)]
*  I would have said, San Antonio, you're going to give me all your picks. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1423.72s)]
*  You can't even make up some shit. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1426.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm getting Castle and I'm getting Vasell and you know, I'm getting, I'm [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1428.16s)]
*  getting at least one really good young player that profiles to be a difference [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1433.4s)]
*  maker, which still like sometimes we fall in love with these guys so much that [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1437.2s)]
*  you're like, you can go back. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1440.1200000000001s)]
*  It's kind of like the JJ Hickson, Amari Stoudemire thing. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1441.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1444.28s)]
*  Amari ended up being hurt a little bit. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1444.52s)]
*  It was like, you know, he'd love that Amari, but, but, you know, we can't [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1446.28s)]
*  put JJ Hickson in the deal and it just happens time and time again. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1449.32s)]
*  And I'll admit even like right now, when I think about the Fox Castle stuff, I'll [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1453.56s)]
*  be like, Oh man, Castle, there's something to him, but then, you know, that's where [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1457.2s)]
*  you can start making some mistakes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1461.4s)]
*  So as far as like, what would the Lakers need to keep adding for me to say yes. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1462.52s)]
*  If the core of this is Anthony Davis, who last year was fantastic. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1466.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1471.44s)]
*  But it was the first all-star team he had made in three years. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1471.76s)]
*  He played 76 games before that. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1474.56s)]
*  He'd played 56, 40, 36, 62 and 56. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1476.52s)]
*  So it was his first 70 game season since 2018. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1480.2s)]
*  And as much as we love what he is and he's already got the ring and he was so [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1484.4s)]
*  good last year, they're like, I got it. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1489.88s)]
*  I'm, I'm trading for him. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1492.4s)]
*  I'm trading for Anthony Davis. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1495.0s)]
*  So if Anthony Davis is the main piece I'm getting back, because I guess they can [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1496.28s)]
*  argue, Hey, we're just different, but now we're competing and Luca wasn't even [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1502.32s)]
*  playing and we get some bad news and it might take another month and things were [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1505.64s)]
*  getting a little weird. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1509.04s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1510.32s)]
*  Um, so I guess you're not resetting it the way we would normally expect to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  franchise and roster to have to reset on moving on from somebody like this. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1515.56s)]
*  But it's what's, what's more likely Davis just ages really well the next four years. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1519.48s)]
*  No, I feel like we're at the tail end of the prime with them. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1526.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1530.1599999999999s)]
*  For me, like if you, if you, if somebody tasked us not knowing this trade was [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1530.32s)]
*  going to happen, make up, make up a Dallas Lakers trade. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1534.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1537.8s)]
*  Reeves would have to be in it. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1538.48s)]
*  It would have to be Davis and Reeves or Dalton. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1540.28s)]
*  I would assume. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1543.12s)]
*  He's untouchable. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1544.8s)]
*  Don connect untouchable. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1545.56s)]
*  The 29 pick and the 31 pick. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1546.72s)]
*  I would have wanted swaps in 28 and 30. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1549.28s)]
*  I'm sticking you with the worst contract I have on my team. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1552.08s)]
*  You're taking that too. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1554.64s)]
*  Like we're going to deal. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1555.8s)]
*  No, it's the Vando deal. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1557.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1559.08s)]
*  Now I'd have to have all the math in front of me here. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1559.92s)]
*  Once Davis and the other stuff is included, then maybe it doesn't work or [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1561.84s)]
*  whatever, but like me and those, I, every five minutes, I still can't believe it [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1564.4s)]
*  happened. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  So when horse, I guess it was on ESPN saying that, uh, the clip notes are. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1569.88s)]
*  The Lakers were the only offer that Dallas had in their pocket. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1576.0800000000002s)]
*  He didn't think Dallas could get all they could get from LA and that Dallas was [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1581.92s)]
*  hesitant to offer Luca the super max this summer. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1585.2s)]
*  I have no idea why Dallas was hesitant to offer Luca the super max this summer, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1588.2800000000002s)]
*  unless they, even if they had some sort of crazy insights to his terrible diet [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1592.36s)]
*  habits, some sort of physical issues that maybe they're only aware of, I still [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1597.6799999999998s)]
*  would offer him the super max. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1602.1599999999999s)]
*  He's Luca Donchich made the finals last year. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1603.24s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1605.24s)]
*  So I don't, I don't, I just don't understand. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1606.32s)]
*  Cigarettes, bill, he could have been smoking cigarettes, bringing the ball up [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1609.04s)]
*  the fucking court. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1611.8s)]
*  And I would still be like, when can we sign you to the super max? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1612.9599999999998s)]
*  By the way, I've heard from multiple teams that I sent texts to in the beginning of [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1616.12s)]
*  this thing, not one team even thought they were like completely shocked, totally [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1620.44s)]
*  off the radar. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1625.88s)]
*  People did not know that he was even available. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1627.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  So this is, this is the sequel, but it's like the Dennis, the budget is way bigger. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1630.76s)]
*  It's like, this is not, this is not little indie high school. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1638.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1642.28s)]
*  This is a big budget. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1642.48s)]
*  I, uh, as you guys know, I kind of hate the Lakers. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1643.72s)]
*  Um, this is infuriating though. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1649.0400000000002s)]
*  Just fair about it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1650.8400000000001s)]
*  Bill, Bill Boston fan was infuriated. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1651.76s)]
*  How dare they get Luca Donchich? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1654.0400000000002s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1655.6000000000001s)]
*  And then what if he gets in like awesome shape in a year? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1656.6000000000001s)]
*  And now they're like reset. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1659.0800000000002s)]
*  I felt like the Lakers were, you know, they weren't real title contenders. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1660.24s)]
*  They were just delusional enough to think they could be title contenders. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  And they weren't, they were headed the wrong direction. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1669.0400000000002s)]
*  And now this is, this has saved them because Dallas didn't feel like [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1671.48s)]
*  their Luca Donchich was worth $340 million over five years in a league [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1675.0800000000002s)]
*  where everybody is getting 300 million for five years now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1679.8400000000001s)]
*  If that part is true, this is just going to go down as one of the biggest [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1683.3200000000002s)]
*  self-inflicted wounds in NBA history. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1686.96s)]
*  The fact that that's where they balked. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1689.4s)]
*  That's where the line is. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1691.3600000000001s)]
*  Inexplicable shit. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1693.3600000000001s)]
*  I think, I'm trying to think, do you, do you believe that? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1696.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1699.52s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1699.8799999999999s)]
*  Have you, do you think you'll wake up tomorrow, Bill though? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1700.36s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but like when something like this happens, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1703.04s)]
*  where everybody is going, you've got to be getting guys in the work in the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1706.0s)]
*  league or texting me going, I can't believe this just like, I can't believe it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1709.44s)]
*  Is there a moment three days from now where you think you'll understand more? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1713.72s)]
*  There's two things I'm not going to understand. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1718.76s)]
*  One, how is this the trade? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1720.68s)]
*  I just, I'm just going to trust my blink reaction to reading it and thinking it [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1724.56s)]
*  was, Sean's getting hacked because the trade seems so lopsided. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1728.44s)]
*  I just couldn't, I was like, ah, they fucked that up when they hacked Sean's. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1732.1200000000001s)]
*  That's one. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1735.76s)]
*  And then two, how do you not chop them? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1736.28s)]
*  You have this incredible asset. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1738.3200000000002s)]
*  You basically, you have an open house for the best house in your neighborhood. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1740.52s)]
*  And the first person walks in and makes you're not like done. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1743.96s)]
*  Done. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1747.24s)]
*  Cancel, cancel everyone else who came in. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1747.52s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1750.64s)]
*  Wait, wait, I think we can get more. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1751.28s)]
*  Nope. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1752.56s)]
*  Nope. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1753.04s)]
*  That was the first offer. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1753.4s)]
*  We got it. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1754.4s)]
*  Uh, I just don't understand that. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1755.48s)]
*  It's just bad business. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1757.0800000000002s)]
*  But he's not even the house. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1758.24s)]
*  He's the neighborhood. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1759.64s)]
*  Like this isn't an asset. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1760.72s)]
*  Like this is not a tradeable player. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1762.72s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1765.32s)]
*  Unless, unless it's for Yokich or Wembedyama or SGA. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1766.52s)]
*  Even then you would have to really think about it. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1770.64s)]
*  That's how good Luca is. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1772.88s)]
*  So I guess Tatum is more untradeable than Luca Brasillo. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1776.08s)]
*  It's one of my lessons today. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1779.92s)]
*  I don't think the Celtics do this trade. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1781.96s)]
*  Big win for themselves. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1785.76s)]
*  Uh, so everyone you're hearing from is like, we had no idea he was available. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1789.2s)]
*  Again, I'm not talking to 29 teams here. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1794.4s)]
*  I'm not that cool, um, to get 29 techs back, or I guess I would ask for 28 techs back, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1796.48s)]
*  but yeah, multiple teams. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1801.56s)]
*  What do we got? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1805.48s)]
*  Tim McMahon. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1805.96s)]
*  We missed this one. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1807.16s)]
*  The Mavs had major concerns about moving forward. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1807.96s)]
*  Look at Donchich due to his constant conditioning issues and limited commitment [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1810.32s)]
*  of another supermax contract extension. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1813.92s)]
*  So we're going to get the now, now they tell a story Monday about the war behind [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1815.72s)]
*  the scenes to keep Luca in shape, that whole thing. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1824.48s)]
*  Yeah, but we all knew this stuff and none of it mattered and they still made the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1827.52s)]
*  finals and the Western conference finals two years before that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  So if you're going to say like, Hey, if he were 32 and available for whatever the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1833.68s)]
*  most it was, and you're trading for 31 year old AD and you know, it's run its [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1838.24s)]
*  course and he's been there a decade plus. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1843.52s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1846.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1847.24s)]
*  So say all of it, cause you're right. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1847.48s)]
*  It's all going to happen. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1848.96s)]
*  What's the problem with shopping them? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1851.8s)]
*  There's nothing that tells me this would be the best deal. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1853.72s)]
*  If you called 28 GMs and said, it's real. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1856.52s)]
*  You have a, you have 48 hours put together your best offer. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1859.68s)]
*  And by the way, you'd leak it. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1862.36s)]
*  You'd leak it so that everybody knew that everybody knew that it was serious. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1864.44s)]
*  So that when it's leaked to say a Brian Winnhorst, right. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1868.48s)]
*  Who he'll probably go, I can't believe this is happening. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1870.96s)]
*  Don't burn me on this. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1873.4s)]
*  He would have to have the relationship with Nico or somebody with that team. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1874.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, that's how this stuff works. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, like Winnhorst is getting calls from team saying, is [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1878.72s)]
*  this serious? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1883.76s)]
*  Like, what do you think they're doing? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1884.44s)]
*  And then Winnhorst is almost like in that position. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  Cause that's kind of like, Woge was so powerful, man. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1888.52s)]
*  Woge was so powerful that people be checking in on him going like, what's [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1891.24s)]
*  going on over there in Dallas and then woge would be telling him the truth. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1895.6000000000001s)]
*  But you would be doing that. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1898.88s)]
*  You'd be planting that seed so that everybody knew because this guy is now [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1900.0s)]
*  available, so put in your final bids because we're serious about this. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1905.16s)]
*  And then you start bidding against things. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1909.4s)]
*  You don't need, you know what I mean? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1910.96s)]
*  Like when there's those blind bids for, um, Daisuke Matsuzaka who had the [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1911.96s)]
*  mysterious gyro ball, remember like they were blind bids and so you didn't know. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1919.2s)]
*  You're like, should we offer 15 or 51 million? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1924.4s)]
*  And you're like, well, you know, it's, I don't want to lose this guy. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1927.6399999999999s)]
*  So you're almost bidding against yourself a little bit. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1931.72s)]
*  So even if all that stuff, which it's going to come out, the negative Luca, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1933.56s)]
*  he was all of these things. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1937.96s)]
*  We want to get in front of it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1939.24s)]
*  You don't want to get this in front of it. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1940.28s)]
*  You don't want to get so in front of it that the rest of the league doesn't [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1941.8s)]
*  know that he's available. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1944.9199999999998s)]
*  So I mean, to me, this is like fireable shit. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1946.4399999999998s)]
*  And that's why I wonder like, did ownership get involved in some level? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1949.84s)]
*  But from what I've heard, it wouldn't make sense. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1953.28s)]
*  Like who's buying a team now that scared off from a super max, especially [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1956.08s)]
*  when it's somebody like this. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1959.6799999999998s)]
*  Rob is shaking his head as violently as if it was the worst season finale of all [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1961.36s)]
*  time on the prestige TV podcast. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1966.1599999999999s)]
*  And him and Joanna were just like, I just can't believe they did that. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  I just can't believe it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1971.28s)]
*  It's just presumed in us and all over again. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1972.48s)]
*  My brain is breaking. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1974.1599999999999s)]
*  Um, it was a time machine. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1975.48s)]
*  The thing that's really shaking me up and we touched on earlier is there isn't even [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1978.52s)]
*  the plausible deniability of trading for things that are on a completely different [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1982.52s)]
*  timeline. Like if you weren't trading for another player in the, in his like [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1986.88s)]
*  ostensible prime and it was all of these picks, all of these swaps, you can at [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1990.8s)]
*  least understand an underlying logic. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1995.88s)]
*  If it would still be questionable, it would still be questionable. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=1999.04s)]
*  But here you have one pick, no swaps, Max Christie. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2002.6s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2005.4s)]
*  Um, you know, you couldn't even get Jalen Hood Shafino out of Utah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2006.48s)]
*  I, we're still a member. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2010.96s)]
*  I texted you today about the Utah. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2012.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2014.52s)]
*  And I was like, this, this set, but so Utah made that weird trade today where they [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2015.28s)]
*  took PJ Tucker's contract and they took money and the quippers. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2019.8s)]
*  And it was like, man, this is a weird trade. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2024.88s)]
*  And I texted Rossello and I said this, my shit detector is going off. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2027.4s)]
*  You do this kind of trade when there's another trade coming. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2032.04s)]
*  And we were like, oh, I wonder if it's going to be John Collins and PJ Tucker [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2034.68s)]
*  for Brandon Ingram, not realizing it was going to be Luka fucking [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2038.52s)]
*  Donchich as the, as the third team. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  But, um, so I'm trying to think like if they had offered him to San Antonio. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2043.76s)]
*  And I w and the three of us were running San Antonio, we would have a two hour [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2052.16s)]
*  meeting and we would basically say, all right, how much, like we could basically [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2056.32s)]
*  give up every single asset we have. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2062.2s)]
*  And if we just end up with Luka and Wemby, we're probably good. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2064.16s)]
*  So if they, do they want Castle, Vasell seven first round picks? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2067.5200000000004s)]
*  Like, yeah, let's, let's do it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2071.8s)]
*  Let's do, oh, they want us to take a bad contract. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2074.1600000000003s)]
*  Like whatever I had to do to just get Luka and Wemby on the same team, I would [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2076.5600000000004s)]
*  have done it and the Lakers basically got it. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2080.0400000000004s)]
*  It feels like 40 cents in the dollar, 41 cents in the dollar. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2083.92s)]
*  Rossello, I just 41 and a half, 42. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2087.28s)]
*  What do we not understand? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2090.76s)]
*  What do we not understand about this? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  Dallas is now under the luxury tax. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2097.4s)]
*  Cool. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2100.2400000000002s)]
*  So that happened. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2100.8s)]
*  According to Bobby marks, there's 628,000 under the luxury tax. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2102.4s)]
*  What, what would you, Rob, you know, some Dallas fans, they're not doing well, by [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2106.48s)]
*  the way, I was going to say, I don't even know what would you say to a Dallas fan [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2111.36s)]
*  who thought Luka was going to be in their life for the next 15 years? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2115.1600000000003s)]
*  There's no consoling a fan of a team like that in a situation like this. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2119.5200000000004s)]
*  And, and, and as we said, there's no precedent to say like, Oh, look, it [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2122.92s)]
*  worked out okay for this other team and this other star. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2125.76s)]
*  Like they rebooted, they got things together. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2128.32s)]
*  Marcus all ended up being pretty good. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2131.1200000000003s)]
*  Max Christie could be there. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2134.6000000000004s)]
*  Marcus all, you know, that's really what they're hoping for. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2135.84s)]
*  And he's further along than Mark was. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2138.0400000000004s)]
*  We should say congratulations to congratulations to Anthony Davis, who [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2140.36s)]
*  will be playing with the center, you know, Daniel Gafford for now, Derek [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2143.6400000000003s)]
*  Lively later, you get what you wish for. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2147.2400000000002s)]
*  Congratulations to Anthony Davis. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2149.32s)]
*  There's no coming back from this. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2151.6400000000003s)]
*  And I would say the polar extremes of a fan base that was able to hold [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2153.96s)]
*  on to Dirk for so long and had all of the hopes in the world that Luka could [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2158.84s)]
*  be that same kind of fixture within the franchise, maybe that was always a bit [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2163.12s)]
*  of a stretch, maybe no player in the modern NBA is that kind of thing anymore. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2166.64s)]
*  But I think they all kind of not have been around longer than this. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2170.56s)]
*  And certainly if he did leave, they're being a little bit more ceremony to it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2173.16s)]
*  They're putting a little bit more of a bidding war to it and not just swept [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2176.84s)]
*  out the door in the night for Anthony Davis and a pick and Max Christie. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2181.2s)]
*  It's one of the biggest mistakes. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2184.9199999999996s)]
*  I feel very comfortable saying this right after the trade. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2187.24s)]
*  It's one of the biggest mistakes I can ever remember in NBA franchise making. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2189.3999999999996s)]
*  How was there not a swap? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2193.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2194.7599999999998s)]
*  How are there no swap every trade now? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2195.04s)]
*  It's like, Oh, and by the way, we get two swaps and you're like swaps [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2197.52s)]
*  and this does you never second round picks. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2201.24s)]
*  There are swaps. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2203.04s)]
*  There was a swap in a Houston deal where I was like, that's such a stupid swap. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2203.7999999999997s)]
*  It gets already set in stone that it's not going to happen. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2207.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2211.2799999999997s)]
*  But you wanted to be able to say potentially we have this other pick because I [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2211.52s)]
*  think it was an in season deal. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2215.2799999999997s)]
*  It may have been the hardened nets thing where the way the math worked on the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2217.32s)]
*  swap was like, Oh, we also get like the swap this year. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2221.6s)]
*  And you're like, Oh, it was the Nets Houston one. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2223.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2226.44s)]
*  Where it was like, yeah, we're going to swap and we had no chance. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2226.72s)]
*  There was no way that was actually going to be in play that they would want to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2229.2s)]
*  swap picks with them, but it just sounded better, right? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2232.2s)]
*  Because all of these trades get reported as like, and potentially up to five [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2234.48s)]
*  trades or five first round picks. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2237.8s)]
*  How I don't like that part of it was one of the first things where I thought it [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2239.64s)]
*  was hacked. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2244.8s)]
*  I was like, Oh, the guy hacked him and wasn't smart enough to put in like two [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2245.28s)]
*  swaps because this deal would always have a couple of swaps in it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2249.16s)]
*  So two things. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2253.08s)]
*  Number one, this is, this is where like, I have to go back to things I've written [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2256.2s)]
*  in the past and regurgitate them. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2261.2s)]
*  The FU factor with Luca now is going to be unbelievable. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2263.6000000000004s)]
*  And I think he's the wrong guy to challenge with an FU. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2267.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2269.92s)]
*  Um, I can't think of somebody in our lives from a basketball standpoint that [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2270.76s)]
*  I'm more excited about to have like a fucking fire lit under his ass now. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2276.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, really? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2280.44s)]
*  You guys traded me? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2281.1200000000003s)]
*  Like what happens if he really takes this seriously? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2282.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like, all right. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2284.96s)]
*  And then, you know, I never felt like from a physical, physical diet, the [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2285.88s)]
*  whole thing, it always felt like there was going to be some year coming. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2291.28s)]
*  We would joke about it on all of our podcasts. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2294.52s)]
*  Oh, wait till the year when there's the video of Luca in August and he's [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2296.5600000000004s)]
*  fucking working out and he's jacked and you know, he's eating, he's eating a [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2300.48s)]
*  grilled chicken and beets pickles. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2304.92s)]
*  Maybe that's going to happen. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2309.0s)]
*  That's one. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2310.2000000000003s)]
*  The other one is, uh, I, is LeBron the next move here? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2310.76s)]
*  No. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2316.8s)]
*  Cause I had somebody that, uh, knows things was saying that they do this. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2317.0s)]
*  They don't give LeBron a heads up. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2321.88s)]
*  And then the next move is LeBron and a Golden state. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2324.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2327.28s)]
*  And they're just basically out of the LeBron and AD business and rebooting. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2328.8s)]
*  What happens to Brian? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2333.64s)]
*  I think he's probably in the trade. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2335.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2337.24s)]
*  I think he has to come LeBron. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2337.76s)]
*  He had a lefty layup today. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2339.64s)]
*  He got one today. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2341.48s)]
*  In the teens again. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2344.92s)]
*  I love all the announcers. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2346.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2351.4s)]
*  But could everybody be nice. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2351.6000000000004s)]
*  LeBron has the no trade clause, but what if LeBron's like, all right, now I'm [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2353.92s)]
*  next and, um, and that door was open too. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2357.36s)]
*  Or maybe he'll be like, this is great. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2360.76s)]
*  I can't wait to play Luca. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2362.1200000000003s)]
*  And then Laker blows up the deal. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2364.04s)]
*  Cause he's like, I'm not paying tax on Bronnie's extension. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2365.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2368.6400000000003s)]
*  Can we stretch Bronnie for the next 18 years? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2370.0800000000004s)]
*  Um, wait, so what do you think about the FU side of the Luca thing? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2373.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2377.8s)]
*  I mean, I think he's already a year and three years where he's just an awesome [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2377.96s)]
*  shape and just declaring war on the league. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2380.96s)]
*  I would hope so. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2383.72s)]
*  I mean, just think how much scarier that would be, but I think he's always one of [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2384.88s)]
*  those guys, Yokoch has a bit of this where you always think Yokoch has spent. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2388.32s)]
*  And it's just the way he carries himself for his 35 to 38 minutes a night. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2393.04s)]
*  And you know, granted it's been cranked up, what he's had to do, uh, especially [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2397.76s)]
*  the beginning of there with all the injuries, but Luca is somebody who forever [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2400.44s)]
*  throughout the game, he constantly looked like he's hurt. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2404.0s)]
*  He's, you know, he's a bit theatrical with it. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2406.56s)]
*  Um, LeBron has been that way for a good chunk of his career. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2410.0s)]
*  We were like, Oh no, is he going to get up? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2412.8s)]
*  Is he going to get up? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2413.92s)]
*  Um, so maybe, but I, he's a pretty mad guy. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2414.92s)]
*  I mean, he's probably one of the maddest players and you would want that to [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2418.28s)]
*  translate some of the off season stuff. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2421.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there have been times too, in Dallas where I hear like, okay, we really [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2423.8s)]
*  expect him to kind of come in so pissed off. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2427.16s)]
*  The problem is like, what are you going to do? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2429.48s)]
*  Like he may, it's not like he's putting up 30 and they're the 11 seed in the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2431.2s)]
*  West, you know, so whatever his approach is, it's kind of hard to tell him, Hey, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2435.2400000000002s)]
*  you need to change this thing. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2439.68s)]
*  Cause I know that his, his background is that, you know, it's, it's just kind [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2440.96s)]
*  of different now, obviously he's very different, his father's different, like [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2445.88s)]
*  it's a different kind of culture and the way they kind of look at the profession [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2448.68s)]
*  of the whole thing, um, I don't know what the LeBron part of it is. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2452.08s)]
*  I wonder, Rob, like, do you think, do you think a D feels like I'm out of this [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2456.84s)]
*  and this is cool or I went to the one team that clutch wanted me to go to, to [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2462.48s)]
*  be paired up with LeBron, win the title and no granted, you know, the Lakers are [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2468.6400000000003s)]
*  just going to do this no matter what. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2474.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2476.04s)]
*  Or, you know, is there a part of this where if LeBron's 35, they don't do it [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2477.04s)]
*  because they're worried about the relationship more with LeBron. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2483.44s)]
*  But again, then they, maybe they don't take his kid. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2487.56s)]
*  I'm just kind of thinking about the clutch part of it. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2489.08s)]
*  If Davis is thinking, Hey, it's cool. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2490.76s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2492.88s)]
*  I've always, you know, Dallas would be one of the five places I'd want to play. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2494.16s)]
*  I have, I don't know if he has any relationship with Kyrie. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2497.68s)]
*  They're going to say all the right things and all that kind of stuff. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2499.84s)]
*  Rob, before you answered that there was stuff on there about a D and Nico [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2501.56s)]
*  Harrison had a really good relationship. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2504.96s)]
*  And that was one of the reasons Dallas wanted to trade for him. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2506.64s)]
*  Take that for what you will. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2509.7200000000003s)]
*  The Nico Harrison part of this is fascinating too, because he had done a [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2511.56s)]
*  pretty tremendous job overhauling the Mavericks roster over the last couple of years. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2515.16s)]
*  Like even moves, I was highly skeptical when they traded for Kyrie in the first [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2518.44s)]
*  place, I didn't quite see the vision of that. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2521.68s)]
*  It was just hit after hit after hit. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2523.6s)]
*  I think it's fair of everybody to be like, I don't know that I would want to trade [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2525.8399999999997s)]
*  for him, but at that point, yeah, go ahead. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2529.56s)]
*  And at this point, if you are a D I agree that if you're a player of his stature at [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2532.0s)]
*  his position that plays the way he does, if you look around the league, Dallas is [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2537.44s)]
*  a pretty good spot for a D to land and the compliment of being the return for [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2541.08s)]
*  Luka Doncic is a pretty strong endorsement of your game in and of itself. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2545.12s)]
*  What's a little confusing to me as we kind of juxtapose all of the pieces in [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2549.12s)]
*  this deal, not only are the Mavs getting a D they're getting this 20, 29 pick. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2552.28s)]
*  But we just said that Luka Doncic is not only this level of playmaker, but this [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2556.88s)]
*  level of fuck you competitor. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2560.64s)]
*  Are you, you're betting that a Luka Doncic Lakers team isn't going to be that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2562.96s)]
*  good in 20, 29. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2566.16s)]
*  I think they're going to be pretty fucking good. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2567.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2568.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2569.96s)]
*  You would almost want the 20, 31 pick over the 29 pick or just get fucking both of [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2570.2000000000003s)]
*  them because you traded for Luka Doncic. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2575.4s)]
*  Give me both picks. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2577.8s)]
*  What picks do you have? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2578.84s)]
*  I'm going to take all the remaining picks you have. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2579.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm getting a slew of texts and they're now moving as we're like 40 minutes after [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2582.2000000000003s)]
*  the trade, 45 minutes to camps are now emerging. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2586.7200000000003s)]
*  The this league fixed it for the Lakers. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2589.6400000000003s)]
*  This is fucking bullshit. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2593.1600000000003s)]
*  You've got to investigate this. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2594.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm getting those texts. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2596.08s)]
*  Are you doing that monologue on Tuesday's pod? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2597.44s)]
*  I want to research it more and maybe talk to talk to some lawyers. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2600.7599999999998s)]
*  And then there's some, there's some Clutch and AD and LeBron pushed the Lakers too [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2605.52s)]
*  far and they finally said, fuck it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2611.7999999999997s)]
*  We've had it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2613.48s)]
*  And that was why they didn't give them a heads up any of that stuff. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2615.2799999999997s)]
*  I actually believe that because I think when the, when there was those stories [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2617.88s)]
*  last week about, what was it a week or two weeks ago about we need some help. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2621.2s)]
*  It was a self-exchange. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2625.04s)]
*  We've got to improve the roster. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2625.56s)]
*  I was in the building in Missouri. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2626.96s)]
*  When they did that I was like, are you guys fucking serious? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2628.44s)]
*  We're doing this again. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2629.8s)]
*  You're doing that. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2631.2799999999997s)]
*  We've got to improve the roster passive aggressive thing. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2631.84s)]
*  Your roster is actually pretty good. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2634.24s)]
*  So I wonder if maybe they're just trying to get out of this business completely. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2636.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2639.88s)]
*  And plus they traded for Luka Dončić. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2640.24s)]
*  So of course they're doing that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2642.08s)]
*  So they trade for Luka Dončić and the Lakers get to be the little [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2643.24s)]
*  guy standing up to big bad Clutch. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2646.6s)]
*  The little $7 billion dollar team standing up to the $15 billion agency. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2649.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2654.36s)]
*  By the way, six months after they drafted his son and gave him a two year, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2654.52s)]
*  a hundred million dollar extension. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2658.2400000000002s)]
*  And so like, you know, wow, you guys really told them. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2660.04s)]
*  You did it guys. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2664.56s)]
*  If we want to compliment them, do you think Palenka at some point, like [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2666.96s)]
*  Niko was like, I need two first and Palenka had the balls to go. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2670.1200000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2673.84s)]
*  I'll give you one. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2675.2400000000002s)]
*  He's like, what about a 2030 swap? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2676.6400000000003s)]
*  He's like, nope, my offer's my offer. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2678.44s)]
*  My shitty offer stands. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2681.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2683.28s)]
*  Cause the story about when the Celtics did that net steal, when it was all [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2683.48s)]
*  of their picks, like it was like a real Christopher Columbus type moment [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2687.0s)]
*  with one of those trades. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2690.68s)]
*  And I remember I was in Brooklyn for the draft cause I was doing the [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2691.8s)]
*  draft for ESPN and I, I remember how confused I was at first. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2696.12s)]
*  I was like, so they get this pick, but then they have the right to do this. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2699.44s)]
*  And the story goes that they were like, Hey, it's Prokhorov. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2702.68s)]
*  Just keep asking. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2705.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2706.84s)]
*  They'd agree. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2707.16s)]
*  And then it's like, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2707.84s)]
*  That's how they got the 17th swap. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2708.2s)]
*  That's how they got the Tatum pick. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2709.72s)]
*  But the last second they were like, Hey, we want that too. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2711.12s)]
*  And he's like, Oh, that's fine. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2713.24s)]
*  That sounds good. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2714.36s)]
*  I will give you that. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2715.6s)]
*  Prokhorov. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2718.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2718.88s)]
*  But working on my Prokhorov. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2719.84s)]
*  I knew it was going to come in handy. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2721.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2722.84s)]
*  So, so Dallas Nico Harrison, uh, um, really values the center position, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2723.52s)]
*  apparently values conditioning and doesn't value picks in the 2030s. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2729.4s)]
*  That's what we've learned. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2733.24s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of how it would have hit me if someone would have told [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2735.48s)]
*  me a week ago, Rob Polinka is going to win executive of the year and what it [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2738.36s)]
*  would take to get us to that point. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2742.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think it just happened. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2743.6400000000003s)]
*  I think it just happened. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2747.2400000000002s)]
*  There's one other, Tim McMahon reporting that Luca was pushing 270 pounds. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, I don't care. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2754.0s)]
*  Like, I don't give a shit. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2754.96s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2756.1600000000003s)]
*  370. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2756.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2757.32s)]
*  Um, we're still looking, we talk about hood Chafino's fit with the jazz. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2758.1200000000003s)]
*  How do you see him playing off of John Collins and some of their base? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2763.0s)]
*  How are he going to play together? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2766.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  I just don't want my guy, Will Hardy to retire this year. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2770.16s)]
*  If there's another on ball dominant dude while marketing is standing off to the [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2773.8799999999997s)]
*  side, the number of times I like Yontay George, but the number of times I'll see [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2779.08s)]
*  him dribble in and then not get the angle and then be like, all right, let me [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2784.16s)]
*  just reset this like Trey young watches that film is like, dude, you gotta move [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2788.4s)]
*  the ball a little bit. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2792.3199999999997s)]
*  He'll go away. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2794.44s)]
*  It doesn't happen all the time. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2795.52s)]
*  Anyway, nobody wants a jazz breakdown. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2796.28s)]
*  I do this point. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2798.04s)]
*  Um, I, I think you wait your whole life to have a player like this, a franchise [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2798.84s)]
*  weight, you know, you hope to have, you know, there's some teams that are spoiled. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2805.16s)]
*  Your team, Bill, the Lakers are spoiled. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2810.36s)]
*  Chicago certainly had that one guy. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2812.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2814.64s)]
*  Not saying Lucas MJ or any of that kind of stuff. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2814.84s)]
*  And LeBron's had some different stops as a more modern version of what we're [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2817.32s)]
*  used to in the NBA, but you hope, you know, as, as an owner or a city, you get [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2820.44s)]
*  somebody that makes you think anything is possible if you have the right pieces [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2828.44s)]
*  around like what happened last year. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2832.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2833.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2834.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2835.08s)]
*  And, you know, the fact that he turns 26, you're talking about somebody who has a [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2835.84s)]
*  chance to go down as one of the 15 best players of all time. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2841.4s)]
*  We, we haven't seen anything yet that would make me think that's not still in [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2844.56s)]
*  play. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2848.36s)]
*  And he's hit every sort of statistical benchmark you'd want. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2849.4s)]
*  He's made the finals already, which is a huge piece of when you're talking about [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2853.6400000000003s)]
*  the greatest guys ever, did they actually have a moment where they got to the big [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2857.6400000000003s)]
*  stage pretty early in their career? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2861.2000000000003s)]
*  He did that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2862.48s)]
*  We know that players peak 26, 27, 28. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2863.56s)]
*  He's not even those ages yet. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2867.48s)]
*  And now he's going to be playing for the Lakers. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2869.52s)]
*  He's going to be a huge star. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2871.48s)]

*  And he's playing for, you know, this is the most famous franchise that we have [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2876.44s)]
*  in the NBA has been the most successful because the Celtics have won a couple [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2881.04s)]
*  more titles. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2884.48s)]
*  I don't count the Minnesota ones, but this is the most famous franchise in the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2885.16s)]

*  They're relevant every single decade. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2894.44s)]

*  It's LeBron, it's Luca. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2905.04s)]
*  Am I missing anybody? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2906.8399999999997s)]
*  That's kind of that Mount Ruff. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2907.9199999999996s)]
*  And they luck out with the Magic Tray. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2909.6s)]
*  That was ridiculous. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2911.3599999999997s)]
*  But yeah, Shaq. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2912.4399999999996s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2915.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2923.08s)]
*  Player acquisitions. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2923.3199999999997s)]
*  Gasol is a big one. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2924.24s)]
*  And then Davis is the last one. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2925.3599999999997s)]
*  So it's, they have. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2928.04s)]
*  So say that again. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2930.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's Will, it's Kareem. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2931.64s)]
*  It's Shaq. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2934.2s)]
*  It's Gasol. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2935.8799999999997s)]
*  It's LeBron. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2937.44s)]
*  It's Davis. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2939.0s)]
*  And it's Luca. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2940.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2942.0s)]
*  Just players they didn't draft. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2943.16s)]
*  That got sucked into their franchise. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2946.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2947.96s)]
*  Because people love living in Los Angeles, including me and Rossella. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2949.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2954.44s)]
*  No one traded for me. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2954.64s)]
*  So just one, one, the only thing we didn't really cover is a Lakers team that [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2956.4s)]
*  will have Rui Hachimora, LeBron James, we think, unless he's the next piece of [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2961.92s)]
*  this, Austin Reeves, Jackson Hayes, Finney Smith, Vanderbilt, Gabe Vincent, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2967.84s)]
*  Connect and Luca, when he comes back. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2974.28s)]
*  And I assume they'll trade for some sort of big rub. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2977.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2981.44s)]
*  And I think I don't want to see that team in a playoff series. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2982.6800000000003s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2985.12s)]
*  I don't, I don't care who is on Lucas team. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2985.76s)]
*  I wouldn't want to play against him in a playoff series. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2988.1600000000003s)]
*  And this is part of this formula too, is not only is Luca one of the best [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2990.24s)]
*  players in the world, he's uniquely capable of lifting up minimum salary [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2994.2799999999997s)]
*  guys, mid salary guys, all the players that are going to be essential in a, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=2999.72s)]
*  in a apron luxury, like luxury era, luxury tax era. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3003.96s)]
*  He's the player that makes those pieces work, that makes a Christian Coloco [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3008.64s)]
*  viable, right? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3012.24s)]
*  That will make Jackson Hayes viable. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3013.16s)]
*  That will allow you to find like who he broadens the range of the supporting [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3014.7599999999998s)]
*  talent you can put around him to make it make sense. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3019.16s)]
*  And so, yeah, if it is LeBron and Luca and Rui and Austin Reeves and whoever [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3021.44s)]
*  you can butcher us around that, it's going to be competitive. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3024.8399999999997s)]
*  It's going to be formidable because Luca Donchich is a part of it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3027.6s)]
*  And it's, I would say one of the biggest gambles in the history of the league, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3030.8799999999997s)]
*  the Mavericks who basically seem like they just wanted to get out of the [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3034.48s)]
*  Luca Donchich business, which was frightening enough to a decision to make. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3037.96s)]
*  But then on top of it, to not shop him. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3042.3599999999997s)]
*  I think it's going to be something that if it works out the way I think the [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3044.96s)]
*  three of us might think it's going to work out that we'll be talking about for [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3047.96s)]
*  the rest of the time we talk about basketball. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3052.0s)]
*  It's like, remember when the Mavericks did that? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3054.2400000000002s)]
*  Remember when they just didn't shop Luca at all. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3056.44s)]
*  They, they traded him for 28 cents of the dollar. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3058.36s)]
*  Um, it's an amazing trade. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3061.84s)]
*  I think we hit everything. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3063.6s)]
*  Anything else, Priscilla? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3064.56s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to follow up Rob's point though, a little bit on like what's [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3065.84s)]
*  possible around it, you know, long term and how he raises your floor so much. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3069.8s)]
*  I always think there's these conference finals runs with teams that are really [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3074.28s)]
*  flukey can actually cause more damage to the team and believing there's [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3077.84s)]
*  something that they're not. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3081.88s)]
*  And maybe a couple of years ago, you could have made that case for Dallas, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3083.28s)]
*  but they turned the team over. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3086.48s)]
*  They were better. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3087.7200000000003s)]
*  They make it to the NBA finals. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3088.1200000000003s)]
*  And we know it's primarily because of Luca. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3089.36s)]
*  But if you look at like that team that played against the Warriors and lost in [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3091.44s)]
*  five games a couple of years ago, like look at the shot attempts, Luca took 118. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3094.48s)]
*  Here are the next shot attempt leaders. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3099.56s)]
*  Jaylen Brunson, who was not even close to like, I can't even say half formed, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3101.8s)]
*  like not even fully formed Jaylen Brunson, Dinwiddie, Dorian, Finney, Smith, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3105.8799999999997s)]
*  Reggie Bullock, Maxie Cleba, Bertons. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3110.52s)]
*  Like those are the guys taking shots against the Warriors. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3113.24s)]
*  And that's the team that he had in the Western Conference finals. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3116.08s)]
*  So I'm totally with you on how he raises it, but I do wonder how much of it is [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3118.3999999999996s)]
*  kind of like feeling each other out, knowing that you kind of have to stay [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3125.16s)]
*  glued to your spot for Luca on those drives, cause he's going to make the [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3128.2s)]
*  pass at the last possible second. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3131.04s)]
*  I mean, that's stuff that basketball players can figure out pretty quickly. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3132.68s)]
*  Like don't reset, move from your spot cause he's going to find you. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3135.12s)]
*  But defensively, yeah. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3138.48s)]
*  I mean, there's still, there are, this is a, no one's going to sit here and go [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3139.8399999999997s)]
*  like, Oh, I don't like them now defensively in playoffs. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3144.96s)]
*  That's not what this is about is you have a face of the franchise that's [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3147.6s)]
*  this special for the next seven years, probably. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3150.4s)]
*  Cause hell as much as we could worry about his conditioning, if he's this good [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3152.68s)]
*  already, right, he's already played at the body type of the guy that ages later on. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3156.24s)]
*  So, uh, I can't believe it. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3163.2s)]
*  I can't, I just, I know I've already said it a million times. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3165.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know how you run a basketball team and you don't let the world [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3170.16s)]
*  know that he's available. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3173.2799999999997s)]
*  And then for the Lakers, when you're looking at the tail end of this Lebron [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3175.3199999999997s)]
*  thing, God only knows how many more years he's going to play, but when you [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3179.7599999999998s)]
*  think you got to keep the building filled, you got the most expensive seats [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3183.68s)]
*  in the league, you got all those sweets. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3187.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's like, well, what are you going to do? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3189.3999999999996s)]
*  People would be coming to see Anthony Davis and Austin Reeves. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3191.16s)]
*  And now you have Luca who other than Otani is now the biggest and, and [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3195.2s)]
*  Lebron, obviously, but Lebron's on the tail end, but now you have Luca who has [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3200.36s)]
*  a chance to be the biggest star in the city and your other option was Austin Reeves. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3204.36s)]
*  Rob seems kind of like sneaky, devastated. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3209.72s)]
*  You just know too many Dallas Mavericks fans. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3212.28s)]
*  You just there'll be a lot of hugs in your future. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3214.76s)]
*  A lot of like Zooms where you're just telling people it's okay. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3216.76s)]
*  A lot of just nodding acknowledgement with people who are in deep existential [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3219.56s)]
*  pain and you just have to be there for them in the way that you can. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3223.3199999999997s)]
*  You have to listen. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3225.9599999999996s)]
*  You have to, you have to feel everything that they're feeling. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3226.64s)]
*  I honestly, for everything that Dallas is going through, I am in utter disbelief [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3228.64s)]
*  of exactly what you just laid out, which is the expedience of the Lakers reset. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3233.24s)]
*  I just, I, I had taken it into account that whenever the Lebron era or the AD [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3238.9599999999996s)]
*  era or the combined era coasted out, it would take a couple of years at least [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3243.4799999999996s)]
*  before they could find their next Shaq, their next Kareem. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3247.56s)]
*  We know they're going to do it. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3250.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3251.6s)]
*  Maybe, maybe this would be the one time where it would actually take a significant [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3252.12s)]
*  window before the next superstar walked in the door. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3256.0s)]
*  We really didn't even have to wait. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3258.8s)]
*  The era didn't even end. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3260.04s)]
*  Like this is the smoothest transition of power that we've seen in recent NBA [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3261.0s)]
*  history, it is jarring on every possible basketball level and an [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3264.2s)]
*  inexplicable trade for Dallas. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3268.96s)]
*  And it just doesn't get better than this. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3270.12s)]
*  If you're the Lakers, it really doesn't. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3272.36s)]
*  One other thing I was thinking about it. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3274.36s)]
*  They got a six year playoff trial before they won it. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3275.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3279.4399999999996s)]
*  One other thing I was thinking, I was just thinking back to my pyramid, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3280.12s)]
*  like the best guys ever. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3282.3999999999996s)]
*  Some of them got traded, right? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3284.8799999999997s)]
*  Like Lebron switched teams, Kareem got traded. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3286.68s)]
*  Wilk got traded a couple of times. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3290.4399999999996s)]
*  Moses, Moses got traded, but really signed with Philly and then they traded [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3293.04s)]
*  him the rant changed teams. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lYIfiyM_oE&t=3297.3599999999997s)]
