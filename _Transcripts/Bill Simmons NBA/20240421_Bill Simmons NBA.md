# NBA Playoffs Rd. 1 LIVE Reaction with Bill Simmons and Ryen Russillo
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzxb3-m1gpU)
*  Then you watch a game like tonight and LeBron kicked his ass.
*  He's not ready to be a top 15 guy.
*  He really, really, really gives a shit about every game.
*  It's great.
*  I love it.
*  This is a long, sustained, offensive excellence
*  that when you watch it, feels legitimate.
*  We're not going to be nice.
*  What do we care?
*  We're just these, let's call it what it is.
*  We're live.
*  This is great.
*  Hi, Rossello.
*  How are you?
*  Hello, Bill.
*  We're taping this right after,
*  right after Oklahoma City, New Orleans,
*  which was the Ryan Rossello classic.
*  We're going to hit round one.
*  We are doing this live on YouTube.
*  We're trying something out here.
*  We'll see if it works.
*  We'll see if either of us get fired.
*  OKC New Orleans just saved an awful round one.
*  I didn't know what we were going to do.
*  I had a whole bunch of dumb games for us.
*  And then, and then what happens?
*  We get a great game.
*  We get a really athletic game.
*  We get a game with some strategy and some bad strategy
*  in the last couple of minutes and some really good shots by SGA.
*  And I texted you over the weekend.
*  You're at the gym, which which I think I tied my record.
*  For most times, I've texted you over the weekend
*  and you text back about the gym.
*  And I said, what do you think the Pelicans thunderline is?
*  Because it had just come out.
*  And you were like, OKC minus one fifty was your guess.
*  And it was minus six fifty.
*  And both of us were like, what the hell is going on?
*  This is going to be a great series, which it is.
*  So now people know Pelicans are plus four fifty for the series.
*  I think this goes seven.
*  This has a 70 feel.
*  What do you what do you think?
*  You can still OKC in six.
*  And when you would set me up that way, then I go, OK, well,
*  if he's reaching out to me on a Saturday morning,
*  this has to be an absurd number.
*  So I went the other way thinking, all right, well,
*  maybe they're still they have faith because New
*  Orleans had some weird numbers where if you look at each team
*  in the West or any team in the playoffs,
*  they're two best players.
*  There's some plus minus numbers that haven't been good.
*  There's some starting five numbers there for the Pelicans
*  that haven't been good.
*  But there's one thing that I've loved about this Pelican
*  team the last couple of years is the depth and all the options
*  and that so many of their players on the wing play defense.
*  So then I was like, OK.
*  And then when I went the other way, I'm like, OK,
*  well, that's the analytics part of it.
*  Where OKC is basically flawless, except for some
*  of the rebounding issues.
*  Right. Which we saw today.
*  This was I was thinking I didn't think about this
*  until the game was going on.
*  This is kind of the draft pick Palooza battle,
*  like these two young teams that also have a lot of draft picks
*  coming down the road and we're not even
*  sure what their teams are going to look
*  like over the next few years.
*  But one of the interesting things was we talked about OKC
*  at the trade deadline.
*  I like, are they going to have more size?
*  What happens in a playoff series when they play some center
*  who's just having his way?
*  That was Valenshunas today and it didn't matter.
*  Like Valenshunas, what do you have?
*  How many rebounds did he end up with?
*  He was over 20, right?
*  20, right at 20.
*  Yeah. And was just overpowering Chet a couple of times.
*  And you're watching it going, this is why we wanted them
*  to get a center.
*  And yet what happens at the end of the game,
*  they pull Valenshunas because they
*  need a little more mobility.
*  They put Nance in that spot.
*  But there was this moment with like a minute left
*  when they got those three offensive rebounds
*  and then they got to stop.
*  And it just seems like just call time out,
*  put Valenshunas back in the game so you
*  can run the same stuff that was working.
*  And they just didn't do it.
*  Brandon Ingram is getting locked up by your guy, Dort.
*  That was a Dort referendum game.
*  And I left him off all defense and I was kicking myself
*  the whole game.
*  I did not.
*  It always goes back to Jeff Van Gundy whenever
*  I would talk about like, what do you do with Luca?
*  And it's like, well, you don't really do anything with Luca.
*  But then there's just the thought
*  that if there's someone that has at least a chance to just
*  match him physically.
*  I mean, it still seems ridiculous because Luca would
*  still end up with 30 points.
*  But yeah, Dort had Ingram all messed up.
*  I mean, because Ingram usually can get to a spot.
*  He's not going to go right up.
*  He can kind of work it a little bit
*  and figure out a better angle.
*  And he's going to shoot over most defenders.
*  And when he got stuck against Dort, it was over.
*  And when he hit that layup late off the steal,
*  you could still see it's like, oh, wait, like Dort's there.
*  And there was still a little hesitation.
*  And then when he got called for the offensive foul, which,
*  look, he initiated enough contact for that
*  to be called if Dort's going to sell it.
*  So I didn't have really an issue with the call.
*  You could have a issue.
*  But like with Ingram, the frustrating thing about him,
*  and I think this has been the case for a long time,
*  when he is awesome, it's like scary.
*  He had a little stretch with the Lakers in the second game.
*  You're like, oh, he's feeling a little.
*  It's a little derantish.
*  Right.
*  And when he's bad, it's bad.
*  Well, today it looked like Fiba Ingram.
*  Too soon.
*  I love your international basketball recall.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Today I was watching.
*  I've decided Trey Murphy is my favorite non-superstar
*  in either conference.
*  I just love him.
*  And I was thinking, like, Kawaii's on Team USA.
*  I don't think that's going to end up maybe transpiring.
*  Just give Trey Murphy the 12 spot.
*  Just put him in.
*  Young guy.
*  He's not going to care if he plays.
*  You can throw him out there.
*  He'll hit threes, play defense.
*  Like, he is one of the most additive guys in the league.
*  It's exactly the kind of guy they should want.
*  I mean, that's the same reason Drew Holliday's on the team.
*  Right.
*  Just additive guys that don't take anything off the table.
*  Trey Murphy, if we're doing an additive guys who don't take
*  stuff off the table, all-star team, he has to be on it.
*  Right.
*  I love him.
*  And what I love is where I think his game eventually
*  will get to, because I forget.
*  I think it was one of the playing games.
*  And the broadcast was talking about how
*  he had added this stuff to his game, the perimeter stuff,
*  the ball handling, getting to a spot.
*  And I wouldn't say it's like perfect or smooth yet.
*  But that was the great thing about before the draft
*  with him is you see the three-point numbers.
*  You see the size and the shot.
*  And you're like, OK, this guy's going
*  to play in the league a long time.
*  And then the more you watched him, you went, whoa, whoa,
*  wait, wait.
*  There's like another element to his game entirely,
*  where he's not going to be one of these guys that just stuck
*  in the corner offensively, spacing the floor.
*  Like he can put it on the floor a little bit.
*  I don't know that it's something where you're going
*  to be clearing out for him the whole time.
*  But that part of his game is there.
*  And if it ever develops, that's just another part
*  of his Pelicans roster that I've always liked so much.
*  So you'd like me, you watch basketball
*  for two straight days.
*  This OKC New Orleans game was played
*  with a speed and an intensity that
*  was pretty inconsistent over the course of the weekend.
*  But there was some youth and.
*  Just was sloppy, really sloppy early, man.
*  I mean, they couldn't shoot it.
*  So, yeah, yeah, but it was fun.
*  But it was there was a franticness that I really liked,
*  because especially after going to that Dallas Quipper game,
*  which we'll talk about later, where it took Dallas
*  like basically an entire hour to wake up and realize
*  they were in the playoffs.
*  There's been some other ones where we just
*  couldn't get the matchups right.
*  And this one was just like two young teams that
*  knew each other really well.
*  Great crowd.
*  And it was just going back and forth, back and forth,
*  back and forth.
*  I do wonder, though, now New Orleans has to basically
*  they have to win for the next six.
*  But they probably felt like that they let this one slip away.
*  Right.
*  This felt like, man, we had this.
*  This was sitting there.
*  So now it's almost like you got to win five out of seven
*  to win the series.
*  It's one of those optical illusion game ones.
*  Look, we both like this series, but there was never
*  like you've never had moments where you're like,
*  OK, the Pelicans might win this whole thing.
*  Like, was it before it was their moment?
*  The series are all four rounds.
*  No, no, no.
*  I meant just the series.
*  I thought they had a chance to win the series.
*  I did.
*  I really thought I would have picked I bet on OKC
*  and seven, which was, I think, plus 400 plus 450,
*  something like that.
*  But I really thought this was going to be a long series,
*  especially like science going to come back at some point.
*  Right.
*  You would think maybe the second half of the series.
*  A couple of other things I just wanted to point out
*  from this game, and then we'll go to one of our gimmicks.
*  Cody Zeller.
*  Who didn't play tonight, but was rocking the big Norma
*  Tech back brace just in case.
*  I'm not sure if you saw that.
*  You know, sometimes you don't know.
*  You got to stay ready, right?
*  It was he had the had the electorate is going.
*  Gordon Hayward, I thought a couple of really good
*  handshakes heading in the timeouts and a couple
*  of good high fives and backslaps.
*  I noticed that from him.
*  We're going to play a gimmick.
*  What's the one thing you saw?
*  Oh, you know what?
*  Actually, I got a different gimmick.
*  Let's do this really quick.
*  Redraft favorite one.
*  No, no, just favorite round one series.
*  Go your number one favorite right now.
*  Going forward, rest of the rest of the next two weeks.
*  Series you're most excited for, number one.
*  If I can only watch one series is New York, Philly.
*  I had that as well.
*  That was my number one.
*  What's your number two?
*  Phoenix, Minnesota.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  I had that fourth.
*  So my number two.
*  Clippers, Dallas, Lakers, Denver.
*  I thought that, so I thought game one, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
*  LeBron ran out of gas.
*  D-Lo was terrible.
*  We'll talk about it when we get to it, but I thought there were those teams
*  know each other pretty well at this point.
*  I thought Yokich and Davis were just outrageous in game one.
*  And I just want to see those teams play.
*  What's your number three?
*  OK, number three.
*  It's probably not any of the other three series.
*  So well, I had OKC New Orleans as my number three.
*  So, yeah, I would say number three is OKC New Orleans.
*  OK, so I have Phoenix, Minnesota, fourth.
*  So do you have Dallas Clippers or L.A. Denver for Dallas Clippers?
*  I was really that would have been higher if Kawhi was healthy
*  because I was picking the Clippers.
*  I was going to zag on all the public momentum for Dallas.
*  I think you knew that because we had talked about it before.
*  But then when you get the Leonard update and you just go,
*  I mean, I can't pick them now.
*  And then who knows?
*  I mean, today was today was so ugly, I don't even know that I worry about it
*  for game two for Dallas.
*  I think it was just that bad.
*  There was more than public momentum.
*  It was a landslide slash bedding tsunami.
*  The line moved.
*  I think Dallas was underdogs to start with the series.
*  And by the time the game came today, after the quarter,
*  you know, is in the like the 150 area.
*  Last three series, would you mention Orlando, Cleveland, Indiana, Milwaukee
*  and Boston, Miami, which your least favorite out of those three?
*  Maybe Milwaukee, Indiana, just because I don't know what it's going to mean.
*  I don't know other than.
*  Like, I think Janice will probably come back.
*  You were joking about Zion.
*  Janice has a really good history of coming back.
*  And did you see the way the schedule plays out?
*  They play game two on Tuesday and then game three isn't until Friday. Right.
*  Well, by the way, the same for the Clippers with Kawhi.
*  I think the Clippers have an interesting decision of.
*  Do they do they basically roll the dice, try to get through
*  one more game with Adam and get him for game three a few days later?
*  You know, you're up on nothing.
*  But I never know what to believe of Kawhi with Janice.
*  I'm more willing to be like, OK, fine.
*  But with Kawhi, even though Ty Lue's pretty blunt about it.
*  Like, you remember one time when everybody's sorry, he's like,
*  I don't know what's going on.
*  And he just said it.
*  And he said, we're definitely getting him back.
*  We're definitely getting him back.
*  Maybe he's just being completely honest and blunt again.
*  But I think I would do that if I were a head coach anyway,
*  even if I didn't know just to mess with the other team,
*  especially after getting the first one.
*  So you're saying you don't know what to expect with a guy who's missed,
*  who hasn't finished three of the last four post seasons.
*  He's Don Draper, man.
*  Like, where are you?
*  I'll tell you, I think this live YouTube,
*  I there's a little hop in your step tonight. I like it.
*  It's like what danger we got game two.
*  Hey, I'm sorry, I'm in Palm Springs.
*  Oh, all right.
*  We're going to play.
*  I texted you to write down the one thing
*  you saw that made you tweak or change an opinion you had about each series.
*  So we'll start with OKC New Orleans since it just happened.
*  Did you see anything over the over the last two and a half hours
*  that changed your mind at all about anything with that series?
*  I feel like the Pelicans have been.
*  Building more minutes for Nance in this smaller lineup.
*  And as I was watching this game play out,
*  I mean, balance units is the reason they kept them in this first half
*  and Pelicans couldn't hit a shot, but their plus 12 second chance points.
*  Yeah. And then that swung.
*  And I thought they a lot of they ran a lot of good stuff
*  with balance units, they'd post them, you know, chat.
*  It's just asking a lot, even though Chet's really positional,
*  while that chat fought even harder in the second half against the defensively.
*  I mean, the chat block that he had on Nance, but they closed with Nance.
*  So. I mean, look, it's Willie Green's team,
*  and I'm not saying the game plays out differently if they go the other way,
*  but I'm really fascinated by that decision because I can understand
*  wanting to play small with Nance.
*  Yeah, it's also kind of playing into OKC's hands a little bit.
*  Yeah, they were super happy with, hey, CJ,
*  Nance is going to say you the pick and roll the basket,
*  and you're going to pass to Nance.
*  And we're totally happy with Nance deciding your offense
*  and the biggest positions of the game.
*  And he was doing the nirgage kind of going downhill, then kicking out to somebody.
*  I think Nance has been kind of a semi revelation over the last few weeks.
*  The great where it's like I don't even who else in the league
*  remind you of him right now.
*  The type of player he is where it's like he's not totally a center.
*  He's not really powerful.
*  Yeah, it's like a good way.
*  My revelation from this from this.
*  Just what we saw tonight is I just think New Orleans matches up really well
*  with OKC and OKC is probably going to win the series,
*  but New Orleans has good matchups like I thought Herb
*  gave SGA as much problem as I've seen.
*  Anybody give SGA the there's going to be games
*  where Valensuners just puts fouls on chat and Chet's going to have to come out.
*  I thought Chet was good today.
*  I actually liked how he played.
*  There's going to be games where he just puts three fouls on him
*  in the first half and we don't see Chet again.
*  Dort on Ingram on the reverse, I thought was another interesting one
*  where it's like, ah, this is a bad matchup for New Orleans.
*  You know, but it just seemed like all over the place.
*  There were bad matchups like it's not really an Alvarado series
*  because when OKC had all their dudes,
*  you know, they could just kind of find Alvarado and go at them.
*  But that's what this was the only series that we had out of the eight
*  where I was like, oh, man, if they do this, then they're going to have to do this.
*  And then if they do this, then they're going to have to do this.
*  It's one of those which I think that's why it just feels 70 to me.
*  If you had to pick one seven game series out of the eight.
*  But I told you one of these eight are going seven.
*  Who would you pick?
*  Because I would pick this one.
*  I would pick Clippers Mavericks.
*  Hmm. And maybe I'm letting history play a little bit there.
*  I just felt like there was going to be a very like quick Clippers correction
*  if all those guys are playing together.
*  And look, we got it today without Leonard.
*  We're going to have a reminder of like, hey, do you know, like we actually,
*  even though Hardin's the newer part of this, I think they think of themselves
*  as like completely comfortable no matter who the opponent was.
*  And you're just not going to see that in certain spots like SGA.
*  They went five plus minutes without a field goal.
*  You know, the Pelicans defense, how hard they worked to have a second
*  defender towards SGA, like they were trying their and he still ends up with what?
*  Thirty. So 28.
*  And there was a three that he took on like a catch and shoot three,
*  which you just don't see a lot from him.
*  And it was during that stretch where they had a field goal.
*  And you could just see him being like, hey, this might be like the best shot we get.
*  So I'm going to take it right now.
*  And then he gets the end one on CJ.
*  And then they get the really easy switch at the top.
*  And it's just kind of at that point, like SGA is just another level
*  of any offensive crater for the Pelicans.
*  And then you have the Jalen Williams third quarter where you don't know
*  who the second guy like Ingram and CJ and then maybe it's Trey.
*  OK, but at least with the Thunder, you know, you know, it's SGA and Jalen Williams.
*  There's no like, you know, one of those guys going to have like an eight point game.
*  It's just not really going to happen.
*  So maybe I wasn't as bullish as you were saying that this would be seven.
*  Now, I respect the Pelicans defensively.
*  I'm sure they're frustrated with how well they did to close this one.
*  But, you know, I like closers.
*  I like efficient closers.
*  And the Thunder have one of the best ones in the league.
*  I like that they're playing while it's late.
*  A couple of things for the YouTube stream.
*  J.Y.D. old school W.W.
*  You can get these on eBay.
*  These are really nice.
*  Oh, cool. I'll take old school glasses where if they break
*  just like five pieces shatter and you hope you don't get like a vein cut.
*  I also wanted to mention I am a little sunburned.
*  I don't know if you noticed.
*  I think about it for this.
*  You know, no makeup.
*  I should have had some some bronzer.
*  I played tennis yesterday.
*  Hour and a half, like around lunchtime.
*  I can't tell you how well I played.
*  It really like it's the rest of the weekend was just
*  just the cherry on the Sunday.
*  Me and my friend Howard, we played these two British guys.
*  I think they were feeling like they were going to beat us.
*  And we kind of took it to him.
*  Seven, five, six, one hit some big shots.
*  Was moving around great.
*  Felt awesome. But I didn't put it on a sunscreen.
*  So I'm pretty bright red right now.
*  So you are you are feeling yourself, but I think it works good.
*  It's a good hue.
*  I'll tell you, when I can see the ball, it's still hit it with so
*  I can still sling it, I can still sling it
*  that way, I can sling it that way at the forehand.
*  I still got it.
*  We're going to take a break for the podcast and stay on YouTube.
*  Watch this.
*  We're back. See, this is how we do it.
*  OK, things that made you tweak or change
*  an opinion you had about a series, you can only pick one thing.
*  Let's do Clippers Dallas because I went to that game.
*  This shocked me.
*  Look, look, I didn't play well.
*  The Mavs were asleep for an hour.
*  There's you throw the game away.
*  It was a bad it was a bad performance.
*  Clippers were really good. They made a bunch of threes.
*  They played with a lot of energy.
*  I thought the crowd actually really helped them.
*  I think Harden like said, part of my fantastic. Yeah. Yeah.
*  OK, here's the thing I took away.
*  They had a lot of trouble with Zubats.
*  And he really took it to Gafford and Lively in a big boy way.
*  And I don't know if he's going to do that every game, but big picture.
*  It made me think like this.
*  This team doesn't really have any of the guard.
*  You could not that anyone does, but he he or Subbats.
*  But the way he bullied them and backed those guys down, I like Gafford.
*  But it almost made me wonder, like, oh, is this why Preston
*  didn't want to trade for Gafford?
*  Because he was just he was just backpedaling
*  and giving up like three foot jump hooks and layups,
*  and he wasn't strong enough to keep Zubats off.
*  Can keep Zubats off. Good luck with Yocage.
*  But they they had a lot of trouble.
*  Eventually they had to play Kluba in the second half,
*  and they had to dump both of those guys. Why are you laughing?
*  Just that we are on a Gafford OKC just content.
*  Yeah, just streak. Yeah, it's like seven in a row.
*  It's yeah, I don't know how many weeks a row we've been able to get it in there.
*  But we have thank God OKC won that game.
*  Here's here's what I think you're it's the biggest overall point
*  that I took from the game.
*  So I think you're right on and you were there.
*  So I'm going to defer to you on kind of what you saw here.
*  But real quick, like they bring in Gafford and then we see all these numbers
*  that improve because Dallas was incredible second half of the season.
*  And there's some real like wins there.
*  When you look at the schedule, the paint defense numbers went up. OK.
*  There was a stretch, I think, at one point, you know,
*  it depends on how you want to box it in and be like, hey, Dallas is the best
*  as far as opponents points in the paint.
*  But overall, second half of the season, it wasn't the best,
*  but it was much improved.
*  The rebounding improved. OK.
*  The there was just a bunch of stuff that you felt like was really good.
*  And then immediately Zubot is just beasting everybody.
*  And you're like, OK, well, like the one thing we may have been worried
*  about your roster construction seemed to have been solved.
*  And then within minutes and some of its how, you know, teams do a really good job
*  of like getting a bad defender matched up with another guy.
*  But then he ends up in the baseline.
*  And now all of a sudden, it's like, OK, like there was one play
*  where they sent two defenders at Paul George and then Zubot is like fronting
*  inside the restricted area and Kyrie's behind him.
*  Yeah. Just like this is this is over.
*  But I think the energy thing was really weird.
*  It was almost like Dallas was playing as if, hey, normally everybody
*  lets us kind of set up here first.
*  And then we dismantle everybody.
*  And that's at least on TV.
*  I don't know what you saw, how it felt like just Dallas.
*  I mean, to have an eight point second quarter is not what you'd expect from this team.
*  Yeah, I took my son who didn't understand why Dallas wasn't trying and asked me.
*  I thought this was a playoff game.
*  The their energy in the first half with how hard the Crippers are playing
*  and Luca was like pissed off about it goes to your point.
*  Luca was like it was like he was playing at the Equinox
*  and a couple of guys in the other team in the pickup game were trying too hard.
*  He was getting pissed off about it.
*  Like, hey, Bob, settle down.
*  It's a fucking pickup game.
*  Like he had that. And it's like, no, actually, it's the playoffs.
*  They're trying, you know, they're trying to defend you and bang bodies with you.
*  And I don't think Dallas was able to match the energy until the second half.
*  First half, they were like, Kyrie was really the only one
*  that I felt like was moving at the same speed of the Quippers.
*  But yeah, I'll tell you, man, look, Luca, I voted for him.
*  Third firm VP, you had him second.
*  He's he's really doughy in person.
*  I was like kind of shocked.
*  Are you changing your Dallas outlook?
*  We talked about it.
*  And I talked about it for five minutes because because we we we both thought,
*  first of all, Ty Lue, who I thought coached a great first half,
*  and he just kept putting Luca in pick and rolls.
*  They were just clearly trying to tire him out.
*  And it was a strategy based on the fact like we don't think this guy's in shape.
*  And they were just kind of running them.
*  They were just trying to put miles on them and make them tired.
*  And by the second quarter, you know, there were little breaks.
*  And he had his hands on his knees.
*  He was getting really pissy.
*  I don't know if they showed on TV, but in the second half in the fourth quarter,
*  he it was one of the times when the Mavs looked like they were kind of crawling back
*  and they're trying to get it into the mid teens.
*  And they had the ball and Luca drove down
*  and it looked like he was going to shoot and he dumped it to Kleba
*  and Kleba missed it and went out of bounds.
*  And Luca was so fucking mad and he started screaming at him.
*  He he walked back down the court and there was like a foul or something.
*  And he started yelling at the Dallas bench about Kweba.
*  But I don't know.
*  And he's like, he's like recreating how Kweba screwed it up.
*  And it was just weird.
*  Like he was just pissed off the whole game.
*  So I don't know what that's going to mean for the Quippers
*  in the in the second game, because I feel like he's going to
*  I predict a bench full game, too, for him.
*  But I was surprised he didn't seem totally in shape to me, which I which
*  maybe this is who he's been all year.
*  I just haven't seen in person in a few months.
*  Well, it hasn't seemed to be much of a factor.
*  So it doesn't even if he moves at this.
*  He moves at this slow speed that he just gets to wherever he wants all the time.
*  But I would have been pissed if I were him.
*  And look, Kyrie, they had a cutaway to him on the bench with the team.
*  And he was kind of like, I don't know if it's because he knew the camera
*  was right on him or not or whatever.
*  I mean, he's a pretty vocal guy with his teammates.
*  But if I were those two guys, I'd be pissed, too.
*  I mean, look at the box score of this one.
*  I mean, those two combined for 64.
*  Look at and shoot it well. Kyrie did.
*  PJ Washington is the only other guy in double figures with 11 points.
*  Josh Green is the only guy that I thought was out there going like, hey,
*  I'm going to play my ass off.
*  So, you know, I don't know if we're going to see more Josh Green
*  if Josh Green solves all the problems in his.
*  But you know who didn't play in the first half? Josh Green.
*  Yeah, he only played seven guys in the first half, which I thought was weird, too,
*  because they're playing Tuesday night.
*  Usually game one, you're throwing dudes out there and trying to see like who
*  who looks ready or who looks fine.
*  This time they just played seven and they weren't even playing that well.
*  And then Josh Green came in.
*  I thought they needed his athleticism.
*  I actually liked how he played.
*  It was 29 points. They got it to 15.
*  And I'm watching going like, wait, is this actually like, is this going to happen?
*  And then you keep thinking back to that second quarter.
*  But I always feel like the game is played to the score.
*  Like the Clippers are just not going to play as hard as they need to play up
*  29, as they would have had been if it were 15 earlier on.
*  So look, Harden was incredible.
*  Set the tone early.
*  Zoo was also just beasting everybody, as we'd already mentioned.
*  And then Paul George, if you look at the final stat line, you might be like,
*  OK, it's not that big of a deal.
*  Eight for 20. I thought he had two threes and then the after time
*  outlay for huge shots. Yeah, easily for it might even be six.
*  So when you you add up those shots where anytime it felt like Dallas
*  was tasting momentum, Paul George just completely shut it down.
*  And if they get Kawhi back like this, this is not an upset
*  despite the momentum that Dallas had.
*  Harden was terrific.
*  I just thought that was the best I've seen him in person in a while.
*  And he had struggled.
*  You know, if you look at his shooting splits after the All-Star break,
*  he was under 40 percent from the floor.
*  He was, I think, right at 30 from three.
*  This the scoring was down to 14.
*  And that's, you know, as we always talk about on the Sunday pod,
*  I'm like, I just want to avoid being tricked by somebody.
*  And well, that's why I don't want to be tricked by this game.
*  Yeah, I'm just trying not to overreact, especially especially these two teams.
*  I mean, yeah, we could say it a million times.
*  Let's see what game two looks like.
*  We all lose our minds every year after only one game to go on.
*  And I actually think it was so bad for Dallas.
*  Like, I wouldn't be shocked if they came back in in one game, too, even with Kawhi.
*  We were looking at the threes.
*  I was telling Ben, like, sometimes when you're at games,
*  you just have to look at who's the made threes.
*  And that's usually what the score is.
*  Dallas was like three for 19 at one point.
*  They just couldn't make anything.
*  And they were and some of the threes were good shots.
*  They just weren't going in.
*  I wanted to mention I mentioned this before in the pod.
*  Westbrook is a bench guy.
*  He was he was awesome in the first half, but there's the Clippers crowd.
*  It's it's a crowd that really likes the team and they really like Westbrook.
*  And he really plays to the crowd and he turns and he makes little gestures.
*  And when he makes a play, he looks out and he's kind of the spirit
*  animal of the crowd.
*  And every time he comes in, it shifts the energy of the game.
*  I think I think, you know, we talked about when he was hurt
*  for a while that they missed it.
*  There's something about whatever he brings.
*  I did not think I was trying to think of other players.
*  Alvarado, I think it's like this, it comes into the game and it's just
*  his energy kind of changes the whole vibe of it.
*  Yeah, but here's the here's the difference.
*  Westbrook used to be one of the best players in the league.
*  I was trying to think of other players who used to be at the heights
*  that Westbrook was at, who kind of reinvented themselves like,
*  you know, like Bill Walton did in the mid 80s, added necessity
*  because he could only play like 20 minutes a game.
*  Westbrook used to play 40 minutes a game, like even on Washington
*  a couple of years ago.
*  He was playing 40, 41, 42 minutes a game.
*  And to reinvent yourself is like, I'm just going to come in
*  bought, you know, guns blazing for the nine minutes I'm in.
*  I'm going to try to get every rebound.
*  I'm going to try to get out leaves.
*  I think he deserves a lot of credit.
*  I also wrote down in my notes.
*  I wrote Josh Green first night in prison face.
*  And again, I thought Josh Green played good.
*  But sometimes the guys come in and it's like in the prison movies
*  when the guys come in with the blankets and there's the one guy who's like,
*  oh, man, it's not going to go well for that guy.
*  Like in shock hour, that one guy comes in and say, oh, man, you look too nervous.
*  And he came in with like the first night in prison face, but then was awesome.
*  So now I'm like my radar for first night in prison faces off
*  a Indianapolis on it.
*  Just it just marked that one down.
*  Yeah, no, I wrote it down.
*  That's good.
*  Indiana, Milwaukee.
*  What was your your one takeaway from this game
*  that changed your opinion of the series slightly?
*  Was it Dame lowered hitting 35 points in the first half or was it something else?
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  He had 35 to have.
*  You know what he had for the game? 35.
*  So the Pacers were favored
*  when they go with the live line, they were minus a point and a half in this one.
*  And then they threw it up.
*  I bought this for the pod.
*  You bought a Dame Lillard.
*  Is there a watch on that? What's going on? Yeah, it's a Dame.
*  It's a Dame time bobblehead.
*  I bought it figuring if he sucked in the playoffs, it would be funny.
*  And if he was great in the playoffs, it would be funny.
*  Dame time, 35 in the quarter. Dame time.
*  It's a good thing you have a family because I remember
*  there was this old guy in a neighboring town that had an antique place,
*  but it wasn't really an antique place.
*  It was just all of his stuff.
*  And if I could just see an 80 year old version of you being like,
*  it is my Joe Prunty bobblehead.
*  But this is it's Doc Rivers.
*  Yeah, it's the Doc Rivers Celtics bobblehead.
*  I have him and Dame together.
*  Dame was unbelievable and made a bunch of crazy threes
*  and even made his old school step back 29 footer to end the quarter
*  playoff three and it was like playoff to him.
*  And it's like, all right, let's see.
*  I'm not going to get too excited because a week ago
*  he could not get a shot off against Orlando, but he looked awesome in that game.
*  Here's what jumped out to me.
*  Halliburton.
*  Who ended up not voting for on B.A.
*  And there was a question of.
*  Is he roped open this a little bit down the stretch,
*  saving himself for the playoffs when the playoffs start?
*  Boom, there's another gear.
*  I didn't see it today.
*  There was no other gear, and he's still not jumping off the TV to me.
*  He was bad.
*  I mean, it wasn't even that he was bad, it was just that he was so inactive.
*  I was tracking a shot attempts.
*  I mean, basically, when the game was over, he had, I think, four total shot attempts.
*  He'd taken a 50 at two late ones there.
*  So he ended up with seven.
*  But over the bulk of the game, I think it was like four shot attempts.
*  So it's really concerning because it felt like Siakam was the only one
*  keeping him in this, but it's one of the better offenses, right?
*  Post all star break.
*  Like, there's a lot of stuff to like about the Pacers here, the uncertainty
*  about Janis, the history through the regular season, taking the five games.
*  But apparently all of those games were before Doc even became head coach.
*  So I think that's something that you have to think about.
*  But the Pacers play with great pace.
*  We know they stink on defense, but they shoot it well.
*  They started all 14 from three.
*  I mean, this thing was a disaster.
*  My favorite possession in the entire game is 58, 29.
*  Dames gone nuts again.
*  And they come out of a timeout.
*  Pacers miss a three.
*  Lillard has the ball.
*  Nemhart's like, I got this.
*  Yeah, he gets right up into him.
*  Dane brings it over half court and it just goes right past him.
*  Like, it wasn't even nasty.
*  He just got around him.
*  And then Niece Smith is a low man and he doesn't even watch.
*  And you're like, how can you guys have this guy lighting you up like this?
*  And then not the Pacers defense, man.
*  It is so bad.
*  So even with all these offensive numbers and the fact that they finished 20 and 12
*  in their last 32 games and the Seattle piece and Halliburton being back,
*  this this was just I think it's the worst performance by far.
*  I mean, even with Dallas, because at least it was.
*  Yeah, I just thought the Pacers today
*  were gross and considering people were wondering, hey, do they have a chance at this?
*  I'm not going to cross them off, but that was not what I wanted for them in game one.
*  I thought they're going to win the series.
*  But Yikes, moving on.
*  Dame, I did we give them enough credit because that was awesome.
*  Thirty five. It felt good.
*  It was like the old Portland stuff where you throw in a Portland playoff game.
*  And I know there's times I can sound like I'm critical of them.
*  And that's really just only because of OK.
*  But we've talked about this guy being like one of the 10 best players
*  in the league for multiple years.
*  And we know he's a little bit older, but, you know, it needs to be a little bit better.
*  And then sometimes I wonder, like, is he frustrated
*  because he just can't do everything and have it all be on his own terms
*  for a Portland team that generally wasn't all that good?
*  So I'd ask myself those questions.
*  But you want to talk about just being ready for a playoff moment,
*  like how short the list is of guys that are more ready for that moment than he is.
*  And it was just a nice reminder to see him kind of look like the Portland guy
*  where you're just like, what are you supposed to do?
*  It was like me in doubles yesterday.
*  That's a little older.
*  I think it's in the I think it's only in the NBA dot com postgame presser.
*  They said it wasn't in game.
*  I don't know if he compared himself to me in the doubles, but it was saying
*  that Howard said to me, we got to beat these guys.
*  And I'm like, you're right. We have to.
*  I got to get back in the time machine.
*  I got to get my first serve in.
*  Just let me take I got to be aggressive at the net.
*  And I got to just hit my forehands with with the bandit.
*  So I knew what they was feeling today.
*  Real quick, too. Let's just add this in.
*  I think Middleton looks really good.
*  Hmm. You don't know.
*  I do. I he's I'm going to say a third of a step slower than he used to be,
*  but he still gets to all his spots and he still gets the shots that he wants.
*  Eighty four percent.
*  Hey, anyone say 80, 81, 82 wrench.
*  OK, Boston, Miami.
*  I have a great one for this, but you go first.
*  Joe Missoula, want to know after controversial part of my take appearances?
*  What was controversial about it?
*  I don't know.
*  It's just the more everybody gets to know them, they're like, what?
*  I kind of love it.
*  He is a first class goofball man.
*  I'm he's growing on me, too.
*  I like today when he had when they asked him about the Tatum, Caleb Martin play.
*  And he was like, I was excited.
*  I couldn't wait to see how Tatum was going to respond.
*  And he was genuinely excited.
*  I think he would have enjoyed if there was a Chevy match.
*  I think he's the only coach in the NBA where if he were in season
*  five, a succession with a main plot line, it would just make sense.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Like, what would he be?
*  Who would a succession character be?
*  He would just have to be his own, but he'd just be in the mix.
*  Oh, he would just be Joe Missoula.
*  Yeah. But he became friends with Kendall and he decided
*  went to Kendall's bachelor party.
*  He would just be like, great.
*  You guys got a lot of doors in here.
*  All right. So my what are you asking me?
*  What are you?
*  Is there anything that made me change my mind?
*  Something that I want to see?
*  Yeah, you can say there wasn't.
*  Here's here's what my biggest take from it was.
*  OK, if this series is like this, I think Boston loses game two of the next round
*  because this was essentially being outside and having an hour as a kid.
*  Just three pointer after three pointer, they could have made even more.
*  And. I almost think it could lead to a bad habit hangover
*  because I don't know that you're ever going to play another team in the playoffs,
*  and I know they shoot a ton of threes, but today was just.
*  I think guys were screwing.
*  Drew caught a ball where he didn't even catch it and he shot it from three.
*  And. They're going to win the series.
*  It was a classic Miami first quarter where you're like, wait, it was 17 to two,
*  and now it's close.
*  Yeah. How the hell did that happen?
*  So I don't know if you have something more significant from this one,
*  because I just don't know what you would see that would make you
*  change your mind about anything.
*  But I just think it's going to play out a very specific way.
*  And Boston may be like, OK, we can't do that now.
*  We can't do what we just did against them in their zone.
*  Any regrets from the Miami fans chanting, we want Boston
*  at the end of the playing game Friday night, you think?
*  Think regrets set in at any point?
*  No, I think people chant.
*  This chance to.
*  I mean, Nick's fans were.
*  Chanting fuck Trey Young after they beat Philly.
*  Right.
*  But I'm going to be like
*  this one guy outside of MSG starting it and then a hundred other people
*  being like, yeah, great chair, good chair.
*  I bet.
*  I thought there was a chance
*  Miami could steal a game in this series, and I'm still not ruling it out.
*  But they're going to have to mug it.
*  They really it's weird.
*  And we're going to talk about Lowry later, but they it was a game
*  where they really missed like the Lowry muck it up guy who did like three
*  kind of on the line things and just changed.
*  It made it more of a hockey game.
*  Wasn't enough of a hockey game today.
*  Did you think it was a code red by Caleb Martin on Tatum?
*  No, I thought he got shoved from behind by Drew Holiday,
*  which everyone missed that part.
*  I watched the replay.
*  I think he was a little off balance and crashed into him.
*  The first time I saw it, I thought he like ran at him knowing what he's doing.
*  But the more I saw, the more I saw it, Tatum gets up in the air.
*  I think Martin expected to meet him in the crowd.
*  Weird guys don't try to guys don't try to hurt each other like that
*  in basketball games unless and if they do,
*  it's a repeated thing where they're known for it.
*  Here's the thing I took away from the game.
*  Caleb Martin today.
*  29 minutes.
*  Four points, over four from three,
*  which, of course, sent me in a rabbit hole for stats last year.
*  2003 ECF, 19 points, 19.3 points a game.
*  He shot 60 percent, 49 percent from three, 22 for 45 from threes in the series.
*  I looked up in the basketball reference where they have the game scores,
*  where you can see, you know, whatever their weird system is to rate the game.
*  Four of his best five playoff games ever happened in the Eastern Conference finals in 23.
*  Seven of his best 10 playoff games ever happened
*  in that Eastern Finals in 2024.
*  He played 64 games.
*  He only played three games that had a score better
*  than his four best games in the Eastern Conference finals.
*  And it just made me think, what an unbelievable fucking black swan.
*  I keep saying black swan event on the podcast, but the Caleb Martin leaving his body for two weeks.
*  I don't know what that was, but there is not a lot of examples of that in Celtics
*  history of a guy who's been whoever he is 99 percent of the time.
*  And then for whatever reason in that series left his body.
*  Well, we brought it up a million times because you're like trying to figure out,
*  you know, like how is this going to happen?
*  Because if there's the thing we didn't like about Miami last year was the offense.
*  The one thing you're definitely not going to like about it now is their offense with no Butler,
*  no Rozier and why Lowry isn't there because they figured those are the Rozier minutes.
*  So I don't even know what's worth breaking down on it.
*  But yes, to remember the Caleb Martin stretch to go back through that,
*  there was a number that said it was like the biggest jump
*  in wind shares per 48 of like whatever a baseline guy's number was.
*  And then to do it for a series.
*  Like in the history of the league?
*  Yeah, like no one had ever done that.
*  Well, the only thing that made me feel good about it last year was it was like
*  maybe this is a belated breakout for him.
*  Like this is now he's not going to shoot 60 percent field goal,
*  but maybe he made a leap and this is the player he is.
*  Yeah. And then he shot in this season. He came back.
*  Right. And against Denver, he scored seven points a game.
*  It's basically Joe Flacco.
*  Yeah. Going backwards.
*  Let's let's do an easy one and then we'll take a break.
*  Yeah.
*  Cleveland or Lando?
*  Both of us are really had our fingers crossed for Orlando.
*  First game of the day, Rocky.
*  Harris Ingalls, Fultz,
*  Cole Anthony, a combined over 19.
*  And my big takeaway was I was really worried about Orlando's offense.
*  But wow,
*  I'm at another level because all they were doing was building a wall for Palo
*  and telling Palo, like, yeah, you're going to have to go through a couple of guys
*  if you want to get to the rim.
*  And then it was just guys jacking up shots.
*  It was really rough.
*  They were so good defensively Orlando and yet still down 15, 17, 19, 15, 20, 18.
*  They just couldn't get baskets successively.
*  And I don't know how that's changing, Marcello.
*  I thought because of who Cleveland had been.
*  That, OK, this is good.
*  I go Cleveland wants Orlando.
*  They're going to tank that game against Charlotte.
*  Try to get all the traffic elsewhere.
*  But it also means the JT Thor, the greatest moment of JT Thor's career.
*  But it also puts you on the Boston line.
*  So I really did.
*  When it was happening, I was like, is this really actually the right move?
*  But, you know, Palo's probably watching the Dallas game going, man,
*  these guys have a lot of help because it was awful.
*  And Palo's their best score.
*  He's their best creator.
*  And he's actually, I think, their best playmaker.
*  So it's not that Mobley shuts him down.
*  It's it's that like, how much can you ask him to do?
*  And I know he had the nine turnovers, but watching the game, I didn't feel like,
*  oh, this guy's just screwing up all over the place.
*  Nobody else was doing anything.
*  And even Franz, who just hasn't had a great year after last year.
*  Now, he ended up with 18 points, but that wasn't like a real 18.
*  I think he had eight of those after the game was over.
*  And I just think it's great that Cleveland on the other side, like,
*  you just didn't know what to think of with Mitchell.
*  The Mitchell Denver series from four years ago is always in the back of my mind
*  of like what he's capable of doing in a playoff series
*  where he went nuts against them and lost in game seven after scoring 36 a game.
*  But.
*  It's it's really alarming, I think, if you're Orlando,
*  I also think the Isaac part of it, which is so much fun,
*  it's almost useless against Jared Allen.
*  Here's what I'll say in defense of Cleveland or Orlando.
*  So they gave up 33 in the first quarter.
*  Cleveland hit some threes.
*  But as the game went on, I thought their defense kind of figured out Cleveland,
*  like they scored their next quarters were 20, 20 and 24.
*  But in general, I thought the pace kind of moved toward Orlando's way.
*  And it just felt like I didn't feel like they were far away from them in the second half.
*  So.
*  I'm not giving up on the magic in this series.
*  I know that's stupid, but I just think this is going to be a muck muck.
*  You know, the line, the over under on this series and in game one was.
*  I think it started at like two or nine and a half and then it dropped to two or seven.
*  Was the over under for that game and it ended up, they scored 190 combined.
*  180.
*  180 combined.
*  Now it's two or three.
*  So Vegas has dropped it.
*  Six points from where they launched it in the first game.
*  And I think two or three is too high.
*  And that's what they 51 free throws combined.
*  I don't think these two teams can score 200 plus points.
*  I don't.
*  I mean, you'd have to have like Jonathan Isaac going four for four from two to three.
*  And you know, Strews go six for that.
*  There'd have to be some weirdo three stuff.
*  I just think this is going to be a rock fight.
*  And I don't know if that's a bad thing for Orlando yet.
*  We saw the same thing with Palo.
*  It's going to be really hard.
*  He's got no help.
*  Maybe, maybe a little more faults as the series goes along.
*  He was kind of the closest to looking like a point guard that they had, but it's hard
*  not to watch them and just think, what is this team going to do this summer with all
*  the cap space?
*  Because this is a great situation for Paul George.
*  You know, somebody awesome to be like, you know what?
*  It'd be fun to play for those guys.
*  You just put Paul George on the Magic team.
*  It'd be great.
*  We're going to take one more break and keep going.
*  And now we're back.
*  So this is how we do it for the people watching on YouTube.
*  Yeah, that's the secret sauce.
*  We don't we don't want to take breaks on the pod.
*  Then you hear, you know, some of our beloved sponsors, but we're still in a position to
*  you know, some of our beloved sponsors, but we're still in.
*  I just keep going.
*  OK, very excited to talk about this game.
*  Denver and the Lakers, LeBron was awesome.
*  LeBron through a great six innings, Rossello.
*  That might be who he is at this point in time as a playoff guy, because he's 39
*  years old, he's been in the league 21 years.
*  I don't know if he can do that for two and a half hours against a team as good as
*  Denver.
*  That's not my takeaway.
*  What was your takeaway?
*  That they had an epic Anthony Davis game.
*  He played 45 minutes.
*  I don't know if that's past the line of like, are you getting the best minutes of
*  him? I know it's easy to point to after they lose, but they've lost nine straight
*  against his team.
*  OK, so.
*  I don't know if I think the branding of the Lakers makes people think that they're
*  in this series way more than evidence would tell us that they are.
*  Yeah, like the line dropped.
*  It ended up at like plus 330 by the time the series started.
*  It was like, Jesus, who's betting the Lakers?
*  They figured it would beat Denver.
*  Somebody could get injured.
*  Nobody's beating Denver.
*  Um, I thought Davis, I thought that was one of the best games I've ever seen him
*  play.
*  And I thought Yocage was also awesome.
*  And that was probably my second favorite game of the weekend.
*  I thought those guys absolutely went at it at the highest possible level of
*  basketball.
*  And I was really impressed by Davis because Yocage, you know, he's one of the
*  best offensive players in the history of the league.
*  And Davis went toe to toe with them.
*  Uh, I didn't think other than LeBron, I didn't think anyone in his team played
*  well, so it was impressive.
*  My takeaway.
*  D'Angelo Russell sucked in this game.
*  And did not resemble regular season D'Angelo Russell.
*  And it got me thinking, I was like, have I ever seen D'Angelo Russell play a good
*  playoff game?
*  And I went back, he's played 28 playoff games.
*  He's averaging 14 and five, 39% shooting 32% from three, 10.8 PR.
*  That's low.
*  When shares minus 0.2.
*  So I looked up, I'm like, Hmm, those are, those numbers are pretty bad.
*  I'm going to look this up.
*  How many guys post merger in the playoffs?
*  13 plus points per game, 39% or worse field goal, 30 plus minutes a game.
*  And they played 27 plus games.
*  How many guys have have that profile?
*  There's only five D'Angelo Russell Ron, our test Jamal Mashburn, Mookie
*  Blaylock and Vernon Maxwell.
*  And that's it in the last almost 50 years of the league.
*  So my point is D'Angelo Russell, maybe this is why you're in trade rumors for
*  December and January.
*  He played really well this season, but he's just says for whatever reason has
*  not been able to play well in the playoffs and they're not going to be
*  Denver once if he can't play well.
*  I can't believe he sustained it as well as you did throughout the regular season.
*  You brought up the trade deadline theory.
*  It may be a hundred percent true.
*  And you know, one point I was like, okay, cool.
*  He had a good month.
*  I was like, wow, he had a really good second month.
*  I was like, all right, I guess he's just not going to miss any shots anymore.
*  But there's something about his pace that when it's working, it's like, Oh, he's
*  so in control crazy plays with this great pace, but sometimes that pace is so slow.
*  It's a little bit like Dallas to start today, but there are plays, you know,
*  they, they put the two guys at the elbows and it's up to him to kind of figure out
*  which side he wants to go to.
*  It may be predetermined anyway, but I think a lot of times a player like him
*  would have the freedom to kind of figure out what he wants and he doesn't even
*  really pick like what he wants to attack.
*  And you know, it's one thing to miss them bunch of shots, but on the other end,
*  it gets it's Denver, it's the playoffs.
*  Like you have to stay glued to your guy defensively and he comes off screens.
*  Like it's the first quarter of a game in October.
*  So I obviously, everybody knows that I'm, I'm not the biggest fan, but I was shocked
*  that he was able to sustain it this long, but this is somebody against Denver last
*  year that average six a game, his split, his shooting splits were 32 and 13%.
*  Yeah.
*  Bench and game four.
*  So look, it's, it's game one.
*  I think the alarming part of this, and it's something that you've brought up
*  before is you're getting these full seasons from Davis and LeBron, okay.
*  Like uninterrupted full seasons from Davis who's had his stuff and LeBron,
*  who usually misses time.
*  And when you put those numbers together, the other thing that I brought up with
*  New Orleans is like the top two guys.
*  If you look at the point differential with your top two guys on the team,
*  it usually is a pretty sturdy number.
*  And for the Lakers, even with that, it just hasn't really been strong enough
*  with those two guys on the plus minus side of things in comparison to the other
*  two best players for other teams.
*  And they start with Roué on Jokic.
*  People seem to think that that solves like Jokic, first of all, is unsolvable,
*  which we all know, but he was eight and nine against him.
*  So then what are you going to do?
*  You're going to ask LeBron to defend him?
*  Cause it looked pretty good a couple of times.
*  Cause he's just smarter.
*  Like you can't do that to LeBron.
*  And now you're asking Davis to carry you with 30 and 15, but then also play
*  Jokic for the full 38, 40 minutes.
*  And he's going to be out there.
*  It was a very Denver game.
*  Like you're going to think you're in this at some point.
*  And even though Murray didn't shoot it well, he had a stretch of kind of like
*  we were talking about with Paul George or like a three shot barrage from Murray.
*  That was huge.
*  And then they start running away from him.
*  And then Jokic is just playing with you, knowing that he's in
*  control, just total control.
*  I mean, it's, it's gotta be the most horrifying scenario to be in for an
*  opponent, especially to be at their place in a close game, thinking you
*  have a chance to pull it off.
*  And Aaron Gordon was really good in that game too.
*  Um, LeBron and the fourth quarter, we've seen him do this before.
*  And I didn't know if he was exhausted or if he was just mentally like
*  we can't beat these guys, but it was like the, you could see the little
*  Terminator lights started flickering for him where it was just like, you
*  could see the hope kind of drain from his body.
*  It was interesting.
*  So he came in at nine Oh eight, but it was 96 81, right.
*  It comes back into the fourth quarter, immediately attacks, gets the free throws.
*  He didn't take another shot.
*  And I'm not even talking about like the field goal attempt log passing.
*  I didn't know what he was doing.
*  I didn't really fully understand it.
*  Didn't take another shot until one 20 left.
*  Cause I remember watching it.
*  And then I went back to go like, wait, he wasn't like, he just was out.
*  And I don't know if that's right.
*  Aim or he was tired or at that point, the score was pretty lopsided.
*  So maybe he just thought I don't really have it saving it for the second game.
*  Yeah.
*  You said something earlier.
*  It, uh, click the light bulb for me.
*  You said everyone knows I'm not the biggest fan.
*  I think that's the title for your book.
*  Each chapter is about somebody.
*  Everyone knows you're not the biggest fan and it's like chapter three,
*  D'Angelo Russell, who else is in that book?
*  Um, there's been some classics over the years.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, Gary, Batman, does he get a chapter?
*  I don't think he's on the radar enough for me to, uh, do all that.
*  Maybe if there's a paperback edition, but like including Gary
*  Betman chapter, uh, but I don't really have any history with Gary
*  Betman, so that wouldn't dare a car.
*  Is there a car in a chapter?
*  No, I like Derek Carr.
*  Oh, you do.
*  Well, I just thought it was, I was, thought it was funny cousins.
*  Yeah, that's a good one.
*  What happens to recent book cousins?
*  What quarterback?
*  There's no quarterback.
*  You're not the biggest fan of Kirk cousins.
*  I actually liked them a little bit more this year, but I'd say over the long
*  hall, I feel pretty good at my, about my cousin's position.
*  I always think it's kind of funny when some somebody will be like, oh,
*  that's where your head's at.
*  If I'm critical of somebody and it's like, well, if I was what you thought I was,
*  wouldn't like her cousins to be my favorite athlete of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's a good zag Kirk.
*  Yeah.
*  Great.
*  Zag.
*  Uh, like when Westbrook got into what was Washington today, I'll admit I
*  had a little like Westbrook moment at home.
*  Where he grabs Washington's arm.
*  That was a hundred percent on Westbrook.
*  And then West Westbrook like grabs his arms down, like, what are you doing to
*  me?
*  And then puts his, but to your point, he's playing to the crowd.
*  He's finding a way to like, if Westbrook's not in charge of anything,
*  like say the ball or possessions or the paperwork on your lease, if you were
*  roommates in college, I just think Westbrook would be a roommate where he
*  break furniture right in front of you.
*  And you'd be like, dude, that's my dad's table.
*  Like you'd be like, no, I didn't.
*  And when you're running an offense for 40 minutes, I think that can be
*  challenging, but in this role and you were in the building, I think it, I think
*  it's serving everybody well with this.
*  So yeah, I got to think of some more chapters.
*  I don't think I want to write that book.
*  Yeah.
*  Be a fun one.
*  Maybe quickie, quickie book.
*  Like feels a little negative.
*  Feels a little negative.
*  Think do negative.
*  Well, maybe, maybe you could, you could zag.
*  I don't know.
*  Mike and Mike can write a book.
*  I feel like you can pump one out or when corner Heiser had one that just
*  said, I'm back for the cash.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm back for more cash.
*  I have that book.
*  Next to it, we've got two series left.
*  Let's do Minnesota Phoenix because I got to be honest.
*  I didn't learn that much from that game.
*  So Phoenix loses, but it's a win.
*  It's a win.
*  It's a win.
*  It's a win.
*  It's a win.
*  It's a win.
*  Phoenix loses.
*  It's the first time Minnesota beat them this year.
*  And it was 92, 72 at the end of the third quarter.
*  So the instinct is to say, whoa, Minnesota really laid one on Phoenix.
*  But I didn't feel that way watching the game that came halfway through third
*  quarter, it was 71, 67 Minnesota.
*  And then they just traded misses for like two minutes.
*  And then all of a sudden, Ant got hot and Ant got hot.
*  When Ant gets hot in Minnesota, the crowd loses its fucking mind.
*  And the energy completely shifts.
*  He had 14, I think in the last five or six minutes of the quarter,
*  he's talking shit to KD and he's puts on the cape.
*  We've seen him do it.
*  And when he does it in Minnesota, the game's over.
*  And all of a sudden it was 92, 72.
*  And it was just this thing that happened.
*  I mean, I don't know if I want to take away too much from
*  Booker not being that good.
*  He's five for 16.
*  I didn't think he looked good, but he also had McDaniels on him and he's
*  going to have to deal with that.
*  But for the most part, I didn't take away that much.
*  Home team's supposed to win game one, Minnesota one game one.
*  I love the abroad, the McDaniels point, because you're watching it happen.
*  And, you know, I'd have to go back and like, look at synergy or something.
*  You'd be like, are they getting Booker enough screens to just get McDaniels off
*  them? The problem with McDaniels, you're the primary ball handler.
*  And that's what Phoenix is going to do here is.
*  He's just on you.
*  He takes such pride in.
*  And I thought they were so physical with Booker.
*  And it's like, OK, well, you guys, like, we're going to get away with this.
*  All right. I'm reaching, I'm grabbing and good for McDaniels.
*  And, you know, he can get in foul trouble because he could be so aggressive.
*  But I'd rather you be aggressive and flirt with foul trouble, especially when
*  I'm not worried about relying on any of your scoring.
*  So of all the different things that happened in the game that you could point
*  to, I mean, the rebounding edge was absurd.
*  They were plus 24.
*  The bench was 48 to 18 in favor of Minnesota.
*  The second chance points, 26 of the rebound stuff that we're talking about.
*  But I think McDaniels defense and I have an ant thought here in a second.
*  But if you were looking for some kind of some like, does this mean you roll out
*  the small lineup to see what happens if Gobert has to chase somebody?
*  Because you think Katie attacking Kat is something that you feel good about.
*  There's a couple of times I think Rudy ended up on him and you're like, all right,
*  he should be able to get him because there's some part of this where you're
*  sticking a three point shooter in the corner that Rudy has to honor.
*  Or does Rudy just play off of him so much?
*  Because then you're thinking, all right, Nurkic played what?
*  25, I think Nurkic was 27 minutes.
*  Like, OK, we got killed on the boards playing Nurkic 27 minutes.
*  So if we go small, like, are we ever going to get a rebound?
*  That's a good Nurkic is a good, good tweak of this one, because it did feel like,
*  oh, is this the series for Nurkic?
*  Sometimes that happens.
*  Like Alvarado and OKC, sometimes it's not really the series for you.
*  But it might be worse, though, is my point.
*  Like, I'd imagine you're down to, oh, I think the coaches do this kind of stuff.
*  They sit around and they think about a million different theories.
*  You know, remember talking about like having
*  Golden State defend Tony Allen with a big, you know, so you could just leave.
*  Yeah, like that kind of stuff.
*  It's like, hey, let's get creative with some matchups here.
*  If we think we could just and I don't really know what the harm would be.
*  And being like, hey, do you want to try something for six minutes?
*  Well, you'd enjoy that part the most from coaching, I feel like.
*  I think they'd be like, like the 1230, 1230.
*  Finally, everybody's eating dinner.
*  You're at the back of the state cast.
*  You're like, hey, what if we put Nurkic out by Connolly?
*  They're like, shut up.
*  We're so. Yeah, I'll eat some stuffed mushroom caps.
*  But I think, you know, what I always try to prevent myself from doing, though,
*  is just because the team lost.
*  All right. Abandon everything and let's try something different.
*  Like, yeah, I'll never forget there was that Atlanta Bucks series.
*  And Bud is probably one of the most stubborn coaches in the NBA.
*  And that's why people get mad at him.
*  But then it's like, OK, but was this the what was his name?
*  What was the goofy center?
*  Which Atlanta Bucks series are you talking about?
*  It was Brooke Lopez. They had.
*  Oh, they had Brooke Lopez in a certain coverage.
*  And for one game, it just looked like, oh, my God,
*  like you might not be able to do this.
*  And it was just one of those, at least for me, a little reminder of how bad
*  something can look in one game.
*  Forty eight hours later, it's the same thing.
*  And there's a completely different result.
*  So I think that's why coaches probably aren't in a hurry to get super creative,
*  especially. But I would imagine like, say, Phoenix loses game two.
*  But I'm not even providing it is like I'm not watching the game going,
*  oh, they've got to go small, try to expose Gobert,
*  have him stuck in the corner, drag him away.
*  If it's Grayson Allen or if it's Eric Gordon or if it's Royce O'Neal,
*  this go bear gets stuck with one of those guys or then they change it up.
*  And now all of a sudden to rants on somebody else.
*  You know, I don't I don't know what they do.
*  And they lost Kyle Anderson in that game with the hip part of it.
*  So Phoenix is too good.
*  They the fact that this team still won as many games as they did and closed
*  as strong as they did against that schedule.
*  But the ant part of it is really, I think, the best part,
*  because it's the national breaking out for him in a way,
*  because there was expectations of like, hey, if this guy's really that good,
*  can he just do this on his own offensively?
*  And this is what you have to do to be who we think he can be.
*  And I know I'm going here, but there's a possession with him.
*  He had scored 11 of 15 of Minnesota's points.
*  OK, and he's bringing the ball up.
*  He crosses half court.
*  Phoenix is like, let's send two to him.
*  And he had every right to take an absolute heat check of a three.
*  That's what kind of like he just was on fire.
*  And I think Murphy's shooting that 30 footer today.
*  I had a try a couple today where I was like, oh, yeah.
*  And it just did the right thing.
*  He's like, all right, you know, I could force this here.
*  And all he did is swing it.
*  And it's such a simple thing in basketball.
*  It's like, OK, they showed you what they want to do defensively.
*  Just move it to one of the sides and then just get it back
*  because they never do the same thing that they started the possession with defensively.
*  It's not like, hey, double.
*  I mean, it's just one of those things that seems to happen in basketball.
*  And then he hits a three and he could have taken the three and forced it.
*  He didn't. He passed. He got it right back.
*  The Phoenix, the Phoenix defense was different.
*  And then he took another three.
*  And I'm like, man, that maturity from him in that moment where he's feeling himself
*  most, I think, like Alpha one a score type guys are like, screw it.
*  I'm taking this three because I've earned it with what I've just done in this quarter.
*  Edwards, do you see that stat about his first 12 playoff games?
*  I did. 28.5 points a game.
*  The class he's in, it's it's in this Luca, MJ,
*  Donovan, Mitchell, Chalmorant, LeBron, Tracy McGrady, basically.
*  It's the seven.
*  It was awesome.
*  I still feel like Phoenix will spend game two trying to or heading into game two.
*  How do we get Booker going here?
*  Because McDaniels is tough, but we we're not winning this series
*  if Booker's shooting 40 percent.
*  So that'll be like the big thing they try to fix.
*  Then will they get wacky with the centers?
*  I don't know. But Booker will be the I have no idea for game two.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  Alan Anderson, not a small injury if he's really hurt.
*  You've also encountered going small if you want to like match them,
*  if you felt like for a quarter, like, oh, wait, what we're doing defensively.
*  But he was there.
*  Alan missed. I don't know. He sprained his ankle later.
*  Well, Alan was another one because we talked about Russell before.
*  I was like, oh, you're good regular season guy.
*  You suck in the playoffs. Grace and Alan.
*  Good example of that.
*  When you mentioned the Buddenholes or the Atlanta Milwaukee series,
*  I got excited because I thought you were going backwards.
*  And I got confused for a second, but made me think of the Piero
*  Anteach series for some reason.
*  One of the great series that'll be like if there's ever another lockout
*  or another covid shutdown, we're just doing an hour on that series.
*  When Piero Anteach, when he ruined Roy Hubbard's career
*  in the Atlanta, Indiana series and created small ball,
*  everything Steph Curry created, it was Piero Anteach and that weird Hawks team.
*  Remember, they pulled the center out 25 feet from the basket
*  and people were like, what are they doing?
*  And he made like two threes.
*  We're like, oh, my God, what is this?
*  And now we have basketball.
*  That's how everyone plays it.
*  That could be a check.
*  Holder, it could be a chapter in your book.
*  You've got the D'Angelo Russell chapter on who he is historically against.
*  I didn't like hear my guy, Jamal Mashburn's name brought up in that list.
*  But I listen, the stats are the stats.
*  It's like Hibbert went to bed one night and he woke up the next day
*  and they're like, hey, you're no longer needed.
*  Yeah. Immediately.
*  He's like, I'm not in the Sloan Conference this year.
*  Now we've refunded your plane ticket.
*  All right. Last series.
*  New York and in Philly, our favorite series.
*  I'll do my my my takeaway for this one.
*  And I said this two years ago after Boston, Brooklyn, game one.
*  And I think you thought I was a little crazy.
*  I think sometimes a series can be decided in game one.
*  And I think this was one of those games.
*  I think the Knicks won the series in game one.
*  I think they're going to win the series.
*  I am I've been saying forever, I don't think Embiid is going to get through two
*  weeks and, you know, we didn't we almost seemed like he wasn't going to get
*  through game one.
*  We're going to talk about Embiid later after we finish this.
*  But I just think they had to have that game.
*  And I talked to a couple of people that went.
*  And there's like two types of Knicks fans, right?
*  There's these fans that go and they're just, oh, my God, the Knicks are good.
*  This is so much fun.
*  And then there's like the diehard fucking Knicks fans who remember
*  the Charles Smith game and they remember Bernard going head to head against Larry
*  in 84 and they remember the Ewing finger roll.
*  And it's like this is like deep embedded.
*  Oh, my God, the Knicks are good again.
*  How far can we go?
*  And they really care.
*  And I think that game at some point became if we lose this game,
*  we're kind of fucked.
*  We might lose the series.
*  And Josh Hardt had a couple of threes.
*  Embiid went over five in the fourth quarter and kind of died.
*  And and they just kind of pulled it out.
*  They got a crazy deuce game.
*  Deuce was plus 37.
*  Deuce hit all these threes.
*  And then Josh Hardt hit the two classic no, no, no, no.
*  Yes, threes. But I thought Philly played.
*  I thought Maxie was that was the best two way game.
*  I think I've seen him play in a big spot.
*  They got a really good hour and a half from Embiid.
*  And and I just think the Knicks needed it.
*  I think it would have been really bad to lose that Brunson was that good.
*  They're throwing some weird shit at him.
*  And they pulled it out and they kind of fought the 55 to 33 rebounds.
*  And I think that I think that's going to be the game.
*  You hate when I do this.
*  No, I don't, because Embiid looking the way he looks right now.
*  You're right.
*  I mean, I'm not going to say, hey, it's it's over.
*  You feel stronger about it than I do.
*  If Embiid were healthy, OK, if Embiid through the whole is not like healthy
*  OK, but say you were healthy Embiid, you wouldn't be saying the Knicks
*  won the series in Game 1, right?
*  I would not. Right.
*  So it has way more to do with how Embiid looks to close this game.
*  From the moment he went down.
*  Yeah. But just in general, you know, it's one thing to do well
*  in the regular season, but sometimes you got to.
*  You just got to pull it out.
*  And they pulled it out and the crowd was great.
*  They've lost a lot of those two over the last few years,
*  where it's like the crowd so hyped and then they do goose egg.
*  Some weird stuff in this game, though, for instance.
*  Kyle Lowry was unbelievable.
*  Yeah, 18. You got 18 from Kyle Lowry and you lost.
*  And was Kyle Lowry like it was like Kyle Lowry out of a time machine
*  from like three, four years ago and doing all the Kyle Lowry shit
*  including that layup file they gave him.
*  I. Again, what about the three when he figured out
*  how to get Hart and Stine to step on his foot on a three somehow?
*  The next day without Grimes plan.
*  I caught what you did there.
*  I thought he was really good.
*  You know who wasn't good?
*  Who might be irrelevant, but he healed.
*  What happened to that guy?
*  He played 11 minutes.
*  That was a deadline move.
*  Like, hey, man, you've got the one the one thing that all these teams
*  have wanted to trade for is your shooting.
*  Yeah. Do what happened.
*  He's like, yeah, I can't get used to them be like, what's his excuse?
*  This is it. Just make some open shots.
*  This is what you're doing.
*  No, I don't even care if you make them take them.
*  And so he doesn't seem to want to shoot.
*  So Lowry is like, all right, you're not going to shoot.
*  You've got the Tobias Harris minutes like he played 31 minutes.
*  Did you remember?
*  Um, you know, in rebounds, I looked it up.
*  I here's the I don't I don't remember any of them.
*  I liked what Philly did with Brunson.
*  Me too. I thought they it was this extended one, three, one thing
*  where they were basically whichever side he goes to, we're sending two over there.
*  We're not going to let this guy just get in the middle of the paint and eat us alive.
*  And so when you look at his line, you go, OK, that actually worked out.
*  The problem is his heart hits those three threes in the fourth quarter.
*  McBride has his night and then O.G. who?
*  Like my biggest thing with him when his contract gets settled here
*  and I know what the record is with them, it's ridiculous, but he's
*  not really somebody you're throwing the ball to being like, OK,
*  now go figure something out. And then he hits a three.
*  I bet money that the Sixers coaches watch the film and go,
*  hey, what we did worked.
*  It's just that all the other guys made all of their shots.
*  So I don't know that I would deviate from that too much.
*  But all of this is a huge question, Mark, because I'm with you.
*  This is how it's going to start the playoffs with Embiid.
*  This is how it looks from the beginning.
*  And we didn't even think he was going to come back in the second half.
*  I think he was going to come back in the second half of the Orlando game.
*  So credit to him for even getting back out there.
*  But if this is what it looks like now and if I'm the Knicks
*  and it reminded me of the Butler game, remember Butler turned his ankle big time
*  and it was like, how come the Knicks aren't attacking him at all?
*  Like I can barely walk and he's still out there.
*  I would be putting Embiid in so many.
*  I didn't even care how many points I scored in the first quarter.
*  I would try to make him move and show against Brunson
*  because he doesn't really have any interest in it.
*  So he might not even do it.
*  But I would I would try to like it's like running the football.
*  I would try to get him moving early to just wear him out.
*  I was talking to a Philly fan friend of mine
*  and we had a serious conversation
*  about whether Philly should only play Embiid in the second half of game two.
*  And just try to get a good hour out of them
*  and whether that was a good idea or not.
*  And this was an unironic conversation
*  because he's dead at the end of these games like that.
*  That fourth quarter and he had gotten hurt before that.
*  But oh, for five, no lift on a shot and just looked like he was dragging his ass around.
*  So it's like, can can we just get.
*  Can we get two quarters out of this, dude?
*  Can we survive in the first half?
*  I don't know. It was it was an interesting topic.
*  We decided he should just play the whole game.
*  That was the controversial outcome of the conversation.
*  The problem is, is that he still is going to get you buckets.
*  So even if it doesn't look great or physically.
*  That's the beauty of his talent that it's still brutal to do with.
*  By the way, like we hadn't even mentioned it yet, because the Hartenstein minutes,
*  they decline.
*  Mitchell Robinson played his ass off and wasn't expecting that.
*  Yeah, I mean, that was a big reason they had such a rebound advantage.
*  So it was an old school Mitchell Robinson game.
*  You know how hard it must be to be like, hey, you're not going to win
*  most of the transactions against the guy you're going up against.
*  Like you're going to look bad.
*  You're going to get fouls called on you.
*  It's going to be really frustrating.
*  He's going to put up big numbers and he's huge.
*  You're going to be dealing with the whole time.
*  But I still need you to have that kind of effort all the way.
*  And by the way, you're never going to be allowed to shoot.
*  We're never going to pass you the ball.
*  Right. He's posted on Instagram isn't exactly his favorite thing.
*  He'd like a few more touches.
*  So his effort, I mean, that's kind of what you expect from Tibbs,
*  what you expect from his team when you watch them all year long.
*  And it's I just hope Embiid can play
*  enough that we have a series because there's no point
*  in even breaking down what it's like without him.
*  But I've heard some people talking about like, hey, if it looks this bad,
*  then just shut him down for Nick.
*  I don't even know how many more chances you get.
*  I know we turned 30 in March, but if you look at this is our next segment.
*  OK, let's hold it. Hold it.
*  We're going to we're going to wrap up the YouTube stream. OK.
*  And we're going to do Embiid and Kawhi and a couple other things.
*  Podcast only. So we're wrapping up the YouTube stream.
*  I like that. I thought it was energizing.
*  I thought there was a hop in your step that I hadn't seen a while.
*  It reminded me of Tina Fey and date night.
*  We're just like, oh, we're going to this crazy restaurant.
*  Oh, the mafia is after us.
*  I don't know if you've seen that movie. It's not very good.
*  I'm going to check it out, though. I'm so check it out.
*  They call me Mr. Red Light in Bristol.
*  Mr. Red Light, that was the nickname.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Like, you may not like him in the pre-show meeting, but when it's real,
*  no, it's real. The lights come on.
*  He's he's right there.
*  You can listen to the rest of this podcast and the Bill Simmons podcast.
*  And we might do this again. This is fun.
*  Thanks for thanks for joining us on YouTube.
