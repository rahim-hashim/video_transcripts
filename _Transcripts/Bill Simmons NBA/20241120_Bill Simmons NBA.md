# Secrets of the NBA-TNT Divorce  ‘The Town’ with Bill Simmons
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQMscRvnUP0)
*  You watch more NBA than probably Adam Silver does.
*  So you are the perfect person to talk to about this.
*  You also, I know you don't write anymore,
*  but you have a lot of inside sources that talk to you
*  about specifically about the NBA and the broadcast deals
*  and their various relationships in the media.
*  So you have some inside knowledge access here
*  that we are going to leverage for the town.
*  So I appreciate you coming on.
*  I even had the first piece of the story on Saturday.
*  You broke the news.
*  Yeah.
*  I know, the Wall Street Journal is bullshit.
*  They were calling exclusive on the settlement news,
*  but you actually broke it online.
*  I said the lawsuit was done.
*  I guess my mistake is when I tweet, I do the I'm hearing.
*  But it's like, obviously if I'm tweeting it, it happened.
*  But yes, well, whatever.
*  Listen, my newsletter gets ripped off all the time
*  by outlets like that.
*  So I just kind of shrug and move on.
*  But all right, so let's get into this.
*  Because I've been covering this a lot
*  and I was not surprised at all that they settled this.
*  This was a money grab.
*  This was a rights grab from the beginning.
*  David Zasloff at Warner Discovery decided
*  that if they weren't gonna get the NBA,
*  they were gonna try to claw something back.
*  And often suing is the way you do that.
*  You left out one thing.
*  Beyond the money grab, all that stuff.
*  This was a rich guy power play squeeze.
*  That was the underrated piece of this.
*  Which rich guy are you talking to?
*  I'm talking about all the NBA owners
*  who were on the committee deciding
*  where the next media rights deal was gonna go,
*  plus Adam Silver.
*  And the problem and the reason this got settled
*  was because if this actually went to a lawsuit,
*  you have discovery of phones and emails.
*  And none of these guys who were on the committee,
*  these billionaires who were like,
*  sure, I'll help out, figure out the deal.
*  All of a sudden they're like,
*  wait, I have to turn my phone over
*  for my last three years of stuff.
*  My texts, my emails.
*  I'm just gonna turn that over to a random party.
*  Adam Silver's going, wait, I have to turn my iCloud over
*  to whoever?
*  I'm not doing that.
*  So you knew this was gonna get settled
*  because Zasloff was doing the rich guy iCloud squeeze.
*  Which I think he might have invented.
*  He's pretty good at that, for sure.
*  Although he is also a rich guy who likes to text people.
*  So his stuff would have been turned over as well,
*  but probably not as interesting.
*  Yeah, well he was like, I don't care.
*  If I'm going down, we're all going down.
*  So I think that was the philosophy.
*  The other thing here is that Adam Silver
*  clearly does not like David Zasloff
*  or any of the new wanted discovery people
*  because they had relationships at the NBA
*  that went back a long time with the people
*  that Zasloff fired and got rid of.
*  I mean, I'm looking at a quote from Adam Silver
*  where he says, it wasn't a long-term relationship
*  with the people currently running Warner Brothers Discovery.
*  Ideally in these partnerships,
*  people aren't pulling out the contract
*  and saying, page eight, paragraph three,
*  you're saying you understand the spirit
*  of what you were trying to accomplish
*  and that you're willing to adjust based on changes
*  that might have been unpredictable.
*  I mean, that's basically saying,
*  really, we're gonna go to the minute language
*  of the contract here.
*  You're not gonna act like a man and stand up
*  and say, how do we work this out?
*  Well, and fundamentally, he didn't have a case
*  because all he had to do was match his side of the piece.
*  He allowed them to create the third streaming-only thing
*  that Amazon bought.
*  He didn't hose Zasloff or Silver?
*  Because ESPN and Warner had to sign off on a third package.
*  They had the matching rights to these two packages
*  and Adam went to them and said,
*  hey, I wanna also have this streaming package.
*  I think at that point,
*  everybody thought it was gonna be Warner and ESPN
*  and then you add the third streamer.
*  So he signed off on that and was supposed to bid
*  on his thing that he had the matching rights for.
*  And as we talked about the last time I was in the pod,
*  it came down to over an 11-year deal,
*  like four or five conference playoff games
*  was what they were arguing about
*  and there was like a $200 million difference
*  and Zasloff held the line
*  and underestimated the NBC piece of it.
*  Comcast, delighted to come in,
*  delighted for the chance to not only steal the NBA
*  from a rival, but to also potentially knock down
*  the carriage fees of that rival once they had NBA.
*  So the fact that he didn't read that part was the mistake.
*  We now know because it was announced this morning
*  that Comcast is spinning off its garbage cable networks
*  and that new entity is potentially a consolidator
*  of all cable networks,
*  including the Warner Discovery Network.
*  So if they can weaken TNT by taking the NBA
*  and putting it on NBC, which Warner doesn't have,
*  they don't have a broadcast network to match that,
*  then that makes Comcast even more stronger.
*  So there was a strategic thing going on here.
*  But Warner now has basketball in Poland.
*  They do, all right.
*  Which I didn't realize,
*  when you factor in Poland and the Nordic countries,
*  maybe a great deal for them, I don't know.
*  Yes, well, with this,
*  I'm sure you know the G League,
*  there's probably some seven foot Polish star
*  that's ready to make a huge impact
*  and turn NBA rights in Poland into a huge asset.
*  All right, so here's what Warner Discovery gets
*  in the settlement of this fight.
*  They get free access to highlights, NBA highlights,
*  for TNT's Bleacher Report and House of Highlights
*  for 11 years, not nothing.
*  Okay, it's not nothing, but we should also mention then
*  if the town wanted to license those highlights,
*  you just write a check.
*  Like literally anyone can license highlights from the NBA.
*  It could be any media entity can just cut a check
*  and get them.
*  Especially outlets like Bleacher Report
*  and House of Highlights,
*  which have audience that the NBA wants or whatever.
*  It's not nothing, but it's also not this exclusive,
*  awesome thing.
*  It's just they saved a little money.
*  So they get live game rights in,
*  as you mentioned, the Nordic countries,
*  Poland, Finland.
*  Well, wait, can we go through the Nordic countries?
*  Can you name all the Nordic countries?
*  Poland, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands.
*  Wait, the Netherlands is the same as Sweden.
*  Denmark? No, no.
*  Don't forget Denmark and don't forget Iceland,
*  which I know is a growing NBA market.
*  Yeah, so Poland's not in there.
*  No, you're right.
*  So Poland was an ad.
*  The funny thing is all of these countries are,
*  you know, nine, 10 hours different, 11 hours different
*  than when the games come on.
*  So the games come on like in the middle of the night,
*  which is why they're not big markets.
*  Well, they did get some Latin American territories,
*  excluding Brazil and Mexico.
*  Right, so they basically got every,
*  got some of the countries,
*  except for the two you'd actually want
*  if you wanted Latin America,
*  which are Mexico and Brazil.
*  So, okay, so again, not nothing,
*  but not anything significant.
*  They also get a five season deal with NBA Digital
*  to produce promo content and other things.
*  And actually there's a-
*  Which is like, that's 350 million in revenue,
*  but that doesn't count all the production costs
*  that they have to spend to make that revenue.
*  So it's a number that's less than that.
*  Goldman Sachs put out a report saying that
*  it's about 100 million bucks a year that they're getting,
*  which is not nothing, but again, not the NBA.
*  So separately, there is a deal,
*  we can talk about that now.
*  Should we talk about inside the NBA?
*  Can we?
*  Let's go first to the settlement terms,
*  and obviously what-
*  Can we talk about what Warner Brothers has
*  for sports assets now?
*  Yeah, I mean that's the whole-
*  Or you wanna do that later?
*  Well, let's do that later, let's do that later.
*  So, okay, go.
*  So this is the package that Warner's gets
*  for bringing this lawsuit
*  and not just putting their tail between their legs
*  and walking away.
*  Do you think that that is a significant asset
*  that they got, significant takeaway?
*  Was it worth the lawsuit for them?
*  Because everyone was making fun of them.
*  Everyone was saying, guys, just, you talk about
*  how you don't need the NBA, you pissed off your big partner,
*  it's embarrassing, don't now sue.
*  If your whole strategy is to replace the NBA
*  with this amalgam of other sports rights
*  that you think is going to maintain your carriage fees
*  without spending $1.8 billion a year on the NBA,
*  then just go do it.
*  Don't sue and try to get these rights back, allegedly,
*  just so you can get some extractions from the NBA.
*  Like, was this worth it?
*  So they were trying to spin this.
*  It was a very carefully cultivated media campaign
*  on Monday that actually, like, if you look at all the,
*  you know, and there's a little whisper stuff too,
*  the NBA ratings are down this year.
*  They are.
*  You know, they were all in, they could have been all in
*  on this super expensive thing,
*  that arrow pointing down on the ratings,
*  and instead they flipped it, and now they're an arms dealer,
*  now they're a seller, and they're actually making money
*  and they're saving all the money they make.
*  I just don't believe it.
*  It's hugely embarrassing.
*  It's embarrassing in rich guy circles.
*  It's embarrassing just as a way to do business.
*  It's embarrassing that he didn't just do the deal
*  when he could have done the deal,
*  when he had, you know, this huge window
*  before anyone else could bid on it,
*  and obviously he thought it was important
*  and he just overplayed his hand.
*  And I don't care.
*  I don't care about any of these people.
*  I don't care which streamer got it.
*  I have no opinion on any of the bosses,
*  but you can't say that this wasn't completely botched by him.
*  So he's trying to save face.
*  The way it was sent out was like,
*  bunch of international packages,
*  and then you look at it and it's all the countries
*  that the NBA doesn't care about.
*  So you have that, and then on top of it,
*  you have this Inside the NBA licensing thing,
*  which, you know, I think we should talk about.
*  Which we'll get to.
*  I also think that was misreported.
*  My note on that is only that, yes,
*  Zaslav looks pretty small and petty here,
*  but he is in a tough spot.
*  He's not in the spot that Disney, Comcast, Amazon are in.
*  He doesn't have other businesses.
*  He only has cable and studios and a streamer.
*  That's it.
*  So anything that he can claw away
*  is probably worth clawing away for him.
*  Eiger's not dealing with this.
*  Eiger would never have sued.
*  The Disney negotiation was, name your price,
*  let's negotiate the details, be done with it.
*  Zaslav's in a different spot.
*  So I will just, I don't wanna defend him,
*  but I will just say that.
*  So let's now go to the separate deal.
*  Wait, hold on.
*  You used a key verb, which was clawing.
*  Yes.
*  Right?
*  So you think five years ago, Warner Brothers discovered,
*  they have HBO, they have all these sports rights,
*  and at that point, it feels like it's gonna be
*  a pretty good battle between all these streamers, right?
*  Disney, Amazon, Netflix, going down the line,
*  Warner, Paramount, Peacock.
*  It just felt like, all right, here we go.
*  Who's gonna win this thing?
*  And now we get to the end of 2024,
*  and Zaslav loses the NBA.
*  He's licensing out the number one property
*  that anyone associates with TNT or TBS,
*  which is inside the NBA, and he's clawing to get
*  the rights in Poland and some ability
*  to have digital stuff.
*  Yeah, don't forget Mountain West football
*  and the Savannah Bananas.
*  He's got those for TNT.
*  And he's got AEW, and you go down all their stuff,
*  and it's just like, it's just a second tier
*  offering of sports stuff compared to everybody else.
*  And really, I look at them as big picture,
*  and it's like, it's HBO.
*  They spun out HBO.
*  What do they even have at that point?
*  That may be coming.
*  I mean, listen, if this Comcast,
*  they're calling it Spinco, I'll call it Crapco,
*  they're spinning out their cable networks
*  into a separate company that is gonna go after
*  other cable networks to put them all on a barge
*  and just float them out to sea,
*  and the Warner cable networks could be on that barge,
*  and then what does that leave them with?
*  That leaves them with HBO, Macs, and a studio.
*  That's not a bad little asset.
*  Somebody would wanna buy that,
*  or that could survive as a smaller Fox-style media company.
*  Right, so the flip would be, all right,
*  let's just be arms dealers.
*  We're just selling content to other people, right?
*  Which I think is, with as Netflix has ballooned
*  over the last couple years, that might be its own strategy,
*  and it might be a smart strategy.
*  Well, that's not their strategy, though.
*  They still think Macs can be a worldwide player.
*  But that, I think, is gonna be Paramount's strategy, right?
*  That Paramount eventually ends as like,
*  let's give content to everybody else
*  and maybe spend less on what we're doing.
*  No, I actually think Paramount's gonna make a go
*  under the Ellison's of making Paramount Plus something,
*  whether that means a joint venture with Amazon overseas
*  or whether that means that they try to go it alone
*  or whether they just pull back
*  and start selling everywhere, we don't know yet.
*  Really, so you think Paramount's gonna get,
*  climb in the boxing ring and really try to beat these people?
*  Not beat them, but coexist next to them
*  and potentially do joint ventures rather than outright
*  throwing up their hands and saying,
*  we're only gonna do the Sony-style arms dealing.
*  I think they are gonna try to be a streaming player.
*  Hopefully, we get to figure it out.
*  I did see
*  an episode where like how it happens that
*  every record pursue everything that shell has to.
*  They are going to they call it
*  the Taylor Sheridan shows, they all kind of have a pattern.
*  Uh, but listen, that, that guy is floating Paramount Plus.
*  I mean, he shows.
*  That shows good.
*  I liked land man kudos to Taylor Sheridan yet again.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  I know he needs it.
*  He needs some affirmation.
*  He needs the boost.
*  So what you mentioned there is that, yes, there was this race five years ago, but
*  what has become clear is that these companies without other stuff, Warner
*  discovery and Paramount, the companies that are so dependent on the television
*  business and don't have broadband and Comcast say theme parks in Disney's
*  case, um, the electronics and Sony's case or art pure play streamers like these
*  other companies that have other businesses like Amazon and Apple, those
*  two companies, Paramount and Warner are particularly vulnerable here.
*  And we're seeing it.
*  I mean, CBS just lost the Grammys to Disney because Disney was willing to
*  pony up a huge amount to keep them and then Paramount just doesn't have the money.
*  So you're going to see the bleeding of these companies.
*  Does it, if you had to rank them, Netflix, Amazon, Disney drop off, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I, except I would say Comcast at least for now is pretty strong.
*  Now there's weaknesses in broadband, the cable business they have, the
*  distributor businesses.
*  Streamer though, they're there.
*  I still feel like a cable network more than anything.
*  I guess they own the peacock.
*  How dare you?
*  How dare you?
*  I guess I know, I know they own the peacock, but I wouldn't put them in the level of
*  the other, like you look at what Amazon did, they locked down NFL and NBA on, on
*  top of all the other stuff to have.
*  Netflix is the strongest that's ever been.
*  And Apple just seems to have an unlimited amount of money to spend on very flashy
*  content with big stars.
*  Netflix got a hundred million people to watch an old man get beat up.
*  I mean that, that is amazing to me.
*  It's I, I mean, I just went through their world with the, with the Vince McMahon doc.
*  Yeah.
*  It's amazing.
*  Everyone watched it.
*  Everyone in my life who has like that.
*  I knew it was like, Hey, I saw Mr.
*  McMahon.
*  I've never, I've never had not since 30 for 30.
*  I've never seen anything like that where it just felt like they were so
*  use big.
*  Good.
*  Hey, first of all, you're downplaying.
*  It was very good.
*  No, but it was just, you just realized how many people have Netflix, you know, and
*  then especially like people under 25, like I look at my daughter, my son and other
*  friends, like that's, they just go to Netflix.
*  It's TV.
*  That's why they got a hundred million people to watch Tyson Paul because it was
*  just TV on a Friday night.
*  They pushed it out and people are, Oh, whatever.
*  I'll click on this Christmas game is going to be amazing.
*  I know.
*  Anyway, the Beyonce thing is a huge flex.
*  They basically created their own Superbowl.
*  This is now the Christmas day Superbowl.
*  A huge flex would have been Diddy.
*  If they had done the Diddy freak off half halftime part, that would have been the
*  ultimate flex.
*  Yeah.
*  I think maybe Peacock will have that for their playoff game, but, uh, all right.
*  So let's go to inside the NBA because you have thoughts on ESPN is getting.
*  And ABC, they're getting inside the NBA, the studio show that we all love.
*  And there are, well, that's the thing.
*  They're getting it only for what is being called.
*  Premier NBA games in the regular season and the playoffs, including the finals.
*  So Tuesday night tune in, you're not going to see inside the NBA.
*  It's only going to be during the prime, you know, playoff run, which is great.
*  That's what they want.
*  The ABC games, the Saturday night games, the play the big playoff games and the
*  finals, but here's what ESPN was.
*  I think, I think Turner would have liked it to be more than that, but I don't
*  know.
*  Here's my question, Matt Bellamy.
*  We know that Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley had things in their contract that
*  if, if Warner lost the NBA, they become free agents or they get to renegotiate.
*  Right.
*  So you're on that show and you watch it.
*  And by the way, Shaq doesn't have a contract.
*  You watch these guys license inside the NBA ESPN for 13 big 12 football games
*  and 12 big 12 basketball games.
*  Can you name all 12 big 12 teams or are there more than that?
*  Yeah, no, I don't.
*  And college football, I mean, there are you tune in on a Saturday afternoon.
*  They're literally 100,000 networks showing games at a given time.
*  So, so basically this is a price of we'll license it and you will pay us this,
*  which they have not released the price because they don't have deals with
*  Barkley and Kenny yet.
*  Oh, you know that for a fact.
*  It's in all the reporting that those guys, if they lose basketball, I know
*  those guys get to redo their contracts or whatever.
*  So they've been quiet.
*  They've been good soldiers, but they still have to get fucking paid.
*  And they're going to get paid for doing less.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're Barkley, you're like, wait, how much are we licensed?
*  Let's say they're licensing for, I don't know, 75 million.
*  I have no idea what the number is.
*  If you're Barkley, what's your cut of that?
*  You know, so I just, I want to see, I want to see the news that those guys
*  have actually signed up and we don't even know if Shaq's going to do it.
*  But then if you look at it from the ESPN side, they've had countdown for 22 years.
*  I was on two of them.
*  The show's never worked.
*  It's been a failed property for a bunch of different reasons.
*  It's because of the producers and because they don't give people enough time
*  for segments to actually talk on countdown.
*  It's the biggest reason it failed.
*  I lived it firsthand inside the NBA.
*  It's two reasons it works.
*  Barkley and Kenny.
*  Yeah.
*  There's chemistry, chemistry, but then they give the guys time to talk.
*  If you watch the halftime of their shows, it's seven, eight minutes straight.
*  If you watch ESPN during the finals, it's 80 seconds.
*  So these guys, if they do it the way they always did ESPN in the
*  past with their studio shows.
*  Inside the NBA, people are going to get pissed because they're going to be like,
*  this isn't the show I like.
*  These guys are like racing to get their thoughts and out.
*  So they're going to have to really change how they do it.
*  We need Barclays comments on like fried chicken in Atlanta.
*  And, you know, the show's a slow burn.
*  Totally.
*  It's a slow burn.
*  It kind of goes.
*  And that's when it's at its best.
*  ESPN doesn't do content that way.
*  They race through it.
*  But TNT is still producing the show, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I was going to say Turner will be producing this show and they are going to, they have
*  full editorial control, they say.
*  And I will, I will also say, so like, like McAfee's same thing where he could just
*  not have, not have commercials.
*  So, but, but that's my point.
*  Like if you're going to give them editorial control and change how you did the
*  commercials, why didn't you change it with the shows you had?
*  Because that would have been a way better chance to succeed if you actually let
*  people have a conversation versus come back from commercial Steven A talks for two
*  minutes, Bob Myers has 20 seconds.
*  Um, whoever the third guy I see is 20.
*  Now we're going to a commercial again.
*  That's one of the reasons the show sucked.
*  Okay.
*  But presumably people have said that to them and they've chosen not to do it.
*  They know this is a brand inside the NBA is a brand.
*  People have been wondering where it's going to go.
*  I will also say that at least in the reporting and press release, this has been
*  described as a straight swap, no money changing hands inside the NBA, simply
*  going to ESPN in exchange for TNT getting these 28 football and basketball games.
*  You're saying that there is going to be money.
*  Change.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what the, like, do they have to tell us there's a little extra?
*  Well, presumably they would tell reporters and it would leak out via these talent
*  deals that they, you know, if they lie, they lie, but I, assuming they're not
*  lying, they're saying this is a straight swap, right?
*  But what if Barclays like pay me twice as much who's paying that then?
*  Is it Warner is good question.
*  Good question.
*  I don't like they, they were, I had more questions than answers after I read all
*  this stuff, but ultimately this is, I think a really good thing for ESPN and it
*  moves them, you know, way more.
*  Somebody mentioned to me that it was the 1980s George Steinbrenner phase of ESPN.
*  Just like big ass, expensive name free agents.
*  And that's kind of who they are now.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and that ties into that.
*  So they, yeah, they're doing it across the board.
*  They just got the Grammys.
*  Same deal.
*  They're paying $500 million to steal the number two award show away from CBS.
*  And they are shoring up their basketball.
*  They're shoring up a lot of other things and the winners are being separated
*  from the also rands in TV.
*  Little tiny Steven a contract negotiation piece to it too.
*  I don't think that's the reason they did it, but you know, he's doing
*  first take and he's doing countdown.
*  But now countdown is being rendered.
*  Like, you know, is this like backup kind of a reality show, real show, not going
*  away, but it's not the same thing.
*  He's not at the finals.
*  True.
*  But there is a provision that says that ESPN talent may collaborate
*  with the inside, the NBA hosts.
*  This is, I mean, really what this is for, for people who cover sports media.
*  This was like Christmas come early between this, the Tyson fight and the
*  Netflix stream coming down the Christmas thing.
*  This is like the best time ever to cover sports media.
*  Like John Arand, he's gotta be like doing backflips.
*  Yeah.
*  It's definitely interesting.
*  So there's a real going on.
*  There's a realignment and this was a 40 plus year relationship
*  that TNT is now ending.
*  And that is significant.
*  We're seeing now with the Comcast cable stuff, the end of cable and the
*  sun setting of these cable networks that have been the driver of sports and
*  sports rights values for the past 25, 30 years, that's all coming to an end.
*  We don't know how it's going to shake out in streaming, whether people are
*  going to watch sports on streaming.
*  I think they are.
*  It's just going to become TV, but there's a transition period and we're
*  living through it right now.
*  It's kind of fascinating.
*  Well, as Coughlin said in cocktail, everything ends badly.
*  Otherwise it doesn't end.
*  I am startled by the, by Turner just losing the NBA is it's a massive deal.
*  This is one of the best relationships we had in any professional sport.
*  And it was something that I think Adam Silver is really loyal to his partners.
*  And it almost like to a fault sometimes.
*  And he just was always, you know, always assumed this was going to be Disney and
*  Warner and then they'll cut out the streamer thing.
*  And I think the fact that this didn't work out with TNT and Warner is kind of
*  amazing, like it, like it really had to get super fucked up for this not to work
*  out, which I think is what it, what it did, but I, you know, it just came down.
*  The moment the new team came in at Warner and fired all the old TNT sports people
*  and started scrapping finished movies and firing people and cutting the marketing
*  budgets at HBO and all this stuff.
*  I think the NBA looked at that and said, what are we doing here?
*  Cable is not where the young people are anyway.
*  Mass is an unproven commodity.
*  We got it.
*  We got to at least look elsewhere and they want a broadcast network.
*  The NBA is getting two nights of prime time broadcasts on NBC.
*  That is impressive.
*  They currently have zero.
*  Right?
*  Well, there's a big picture thing about the NBA about, um, and that ties in the
*  ratings I talked about on my podcast last week, the content, there's too much of it
*  and it's too available and there's nothing special about it.
*  Like I heard, uh, was driving home and Sean Grandy, the Celtics radio announcer
*  was talking about the Celtic schedule.
*  And he said 30 of the last 60 Celtic games are on national TV.
*  Think about that.
*  Half of their games are going to be a national TV for the
*  last three fourths of the season.
*  And it's just like with the 82 game schedule, which just would have been the
*  perfect chance for them to cut back on and try to make it a little more special
*  when the NBA comes on, they just didn't.
*  So I think the ratings are going to keep going down for the games.
*  And yet I still feel like the interest is there.
*  I still feel like people care.
*  Like especially the Lakers now that Dalton connect is a member of the big
*  three with LeBron and AD, we got that.
*  But, uh, but I just, I think it's moving into a different phase in general,
*  whereas the NFL seems to be just gaining strength and they are everyone else.
*  Baseball had a great playoffs because the Yankees Dodgers, like that was amazing.
*  They'll probably never be able to replicate that.
*  It's so situational.
*  NFL is not situational.
*  It doesn't matter who the teams are.
*  You could have chargers, Bengals on a Sunday night.
*  You write the.
*  The black sheep LA team against the team from Cincinnati.
*  And it's a water cooler game that everyone talks about the next day.
*  You just can't compete with it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's amazing.
*  I have a question.
*  Do you think the NBA ratings decline has anything to do with the fact that the,
*  the two most popular stars are playing on the West coast, Steph and LeBron
*  for the last five years?
*  I don't, I don't.
*  I think they've had, uh, they're under 30 class of superstars, which we talked
*  about in my pod last week.
*  It's all foreign guys and those guys just don't resonate the same way that
*  the three unicorns from this century for the NBA were Kobe and LeBron and Curry.
*  Those were like American grown stars that all were in these
*  unicorn situations, right?
*  Kobe ends up on the Lakers as an 18 year old.
*  LeBron gets more fanfare than anybody that's coming to the league in the
*  last 40 years and actually lives up to it.
*  And then does the decision, which pushes him to a whole other level of notoriety.
*  And then, you know, Curry basically recreates how basketball is being played
*  with the three point shooting and just becomes a phenomenon and beloved by kids.
*  There's nobody under 30 that I feel like even has a chance to replicate that right
*  now, maybe Anthony Edwards, but he's in Minnesota, you know, and, and I, I just,
*  I don't know how they're going to do it.
*  It's it's when Benyama is going to be the next Curry.
*  I don't see it.
*  All right.
*  I do want to get into this question of the sports rights that Warner
*  discovery does have because let's do it.
*  Replacing the NBA.
*  They have put together a murderers row of B and C level sports rights.
*  There's the mountain West football.
*  There is some big 12 games, football and basketball, uh, when women's and men's
*  there is the French open.
*  There's some NASCAR.
*  Uh, what else am I missing here?
*  NHL.
*  NHL.
*  Yes, they do.
*  They still have half of March madness and they do have some MLB.
*  They have some world series playoff games.
*  They've sub license.
*  I think they don't have the world series.
*  They have some non world series playoff game.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  They sub license some college football playoff games for me as PN, which
*  he was delighted to do.
*  Yes.
*  It's, and they have AEW, which, you know, they just did a big commitment to,
*  which is like kind of the, uh, discount WWE, which is also like arrow pointing
*  down from a product standpoint and from an interest standpoint.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's a bunch of stuff.
*  And when you add up the list, it looks like something, but it's just a bunch of
*  stuff they don't have, like what they don't have is the signature property.
*  Like, even if you look at Paramount Paramount, it's like, yo, when CBS shows
*  football, when they show NFL, you can also watch it on Paramount now.
*  So I have the premier league stuff, right?
*  And the, and the masters, right?
*  NBC.
*  It's like, Hey, peacock.
*  You can watch any NFL game on peacock Sunday night football, knock yourself out.
*  It's also on peacock.
*  So it's at least these temple properties to put on the front page when they have
*  that montage of faces and it's like LeBron James and Patrick Mahomes.
*  I don't, what is the montage for WBD?
*  So it's like, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Generic college football player, generic NASCAR driver.
*  Um, it's, it's, uh, what's that guy's name?
*  The MJF, the star of the AW, his face is on there.
*  That is your world.
*  My, I do not even know.
*  I'll caress.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  I mean, maybe Aaron judge.
*  Here's the thing though.
*  You and I look at this and we see garbage.
*  All they care about at Warner discovery is maintaining the $3 price that they get
*  for TNT and are any of these cable carriers going to drop the price or drop the network
*  entirely when they do have enough, they have enough sports where, yeah, if you drop TNT,
*  you'll get some angry calls when the college football game that your team is playing is
*  not carried by your local cable provider.
*  Right.
*  They did the charter deal.
*  Now charter has some shared shareholders with Warner discovery, but charter did a deal
*  recently where they basically maintained carriage of TNT and they included max and they
*  included some other stuff into it as concessions, but they were pretty happy with it.
*  And Comcast is the big one.
*  If Comcast goes into this negotiation for their cable subscribers and says, guys, we
*  are not paying $3 for this channel with Mountain West football and some tennis and we
*  dropped the price or we dropped the channel.
*  That's going to be the big moment.
*  You know, this world better than I do.
*  I don't really understand what the tipping point is to keep a channel.
*  But it feels like we're going to find out.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's all sorts of leverage points because these companies own multiple
*  channels.
*  You know, they say, okay, you want to drop TNT?
*  Well, we have CNN.
*  You can't drop CNN.
*  What happens when there's another January 6th and your viewers want to watch CNN?
*  Now CNN's ratings are also really bad right now.
*  They say, oh, well, wait a second.
*  We have TBS.
*  We have these other channels.
*  We have, you know, the HLN channel.
*  They use their packages to essentially maintain their fees.
*  And TNT has been a driver of those fees across the board because of the NBA content.
*  Well, think about this comedy central, which is basically the John Stewart show.
*  And and what are the reruns they show all day?
*  The office and Seinfeld.
*  Just like license stuff.
*  By the way, the Daily Show is on Paramount Plus also.
*  Right.
*  But Daily Show would be the only reason to keep it.
*  I'm looking at all the assets they have and like, why wouldn't I just not have it
*  and then get it for March Madness for two weeks and then cancel it again?
*  Right.
*  Why wouldn't I?
*  Or if I'm an MLB playoffs guy and my teammate is like, oh, I live in LA.
*  I better get it.
*  But there's nothing that really jumps out to me.
*  The French Open's on, you know, the four in the morning.
*  You're a sophisticated consumer.
*  Most people don't think that way.
*  And it's just the value of the cable bundle is that it's all there.
*  But what we're seeing is that for the most part, all the stuff that matters is on
*  streaming now.
*  So when that's the case, how are you maintaining your carriage fees for your cable
*  channels?
*  That is the question they're all asking.
*  And Comcast just pulled the cord and said, we're just not going to deal with that
*  anymore.
*  We're going to put them in a separate company and they will degrade on their own.
*  Warner Discovery may do that.
*  Their stock was up five percent today, probably because people are like, oh, now
*  that Comcast is going to have this separate company to conglomerate all the cable
*  networks, Warner will just put their cable networks there.
*  Right.
*  Plus White Lotus is coming back.
*  Good.
*  I've seen the trailer.
*  It's very good.
*  I think they I think they did a terrific job at spinning this.
*  So it seemed like a positive when in my educated opinion, this was the opposite of
*  a positive.
*  This was a negative.
*  This worked out terribly for Warner.
*  They would have been better off spending the money.
*  It would have given them a face for all their sports coverage.
*  It would have solidified whatever their carriage fee situation is, and it would
*  have given them a property.
*  But they're cutting back left and right on all this stuff.
*  And we're watching it in real time.
*  Like they they've been carving out money all over the place.
*  They've been taking shows on HBO and pushing them into different calendar years.
*  And it's all about like reducing this debt that came from a merger, which brings
*  back the question I asked you last time, where what was the last media merger
*  that actually worked it?
*  Mergers are next four years going to be a merger Palooza in media, right?
*  Mergers usually mean two guys had a bad idea and thought one plus one equals three,
*  or it means two businesses that were failing needed to consolidate.
*  So it'd be easier to lay off some people, which, yeah, I've just seen.
*  I mean, that's what happened.
*  Was it the people currently running Warner where the discovery people and
*  discovery was going down, down, down because they're a cable television
*  company.
*  So they loaded up with the Warner studio, HBO, Max, and a bunch of debt.
*  And now we have Warner Brothers discovery.
*  Can I give you the greatest what if for the last six years, what if Apple just
*  buys HBO and overpays for it from the get go and just takes it out of the Warner
*  thing and gives them some crazy price for it, which wouldn't have been that crazy
*  when you think of what Apple spends on all of their content.
*  What was the final number for what they've spent for the last five years on
*  their shows and movies and documentaries?
*  I don't think they've released that, but it's billions and billions and billions.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's in, it's, it's above 10 billion.
*  So if they had spent 10 billion on HBO, which we would have been like, Whoa,
*  that's so much money.
*  It actually would have been a great deal.
*  And they would have gotten a whole lot of things.
*  They still would have had to make the shows.
*  But, uh, yeah, I mean, that what you're referring to is that Apple wanted to
*  buy HBO 10 years ago.
*  It was less than that.
*  It was like when Puppa or after Puppa HBO and like, he was trying to
*  shepherd some Apple HBO.
*  They didn't want the cable networks.
*  They just wanted HBO and Warner was not willing to part with just HBO.
*  It's a great what if, because if they do that, it's probably better for Warner
*  because they would have been flush with cash.
*  It would have been better for Apple.
*  Like it's just a better ecosystem than what we turned out to be.
*  Unless you're Reese Witherspoon and your Apple's just firing money at you with
*  a t-shirt candidate.
*  Yes.
*  Unless you are Alfonso Cuaron, who have you watched that disclosure or
*  disclaimer show apparently made me blush.
*  Apparently it's like $175, $200 million that show.
*  Oh my God.
*  I'll tell you episode three was pushed in about as far with the sex thing as
*  I've seen on a TV show in a while.
*  And I'm here for it.
*  I haven't seen it yet.
*  That's surprising for Apple.
*  They're a little bit, they're not HBO.
*  They pull back a little bit on that stuff.
*  Oh, Apple was like, you don't think we can do sex on Apple TV?
*  Huh?
*  Have a seat because we're doing it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The third people told me about the third episode and I was like, it can't be that
*  crazy.
*  And I was like, oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  As long as you don't mention China or like forced labor or anything like that, you
*  can show whatever you want on Apple.
*  Well, well the thing is they experimented with sex when they did the Patriots
*  documentary and they fucked Bill Belichick as hard as they did.
*  So they're like, let's just start doing this with sex scenes.
*  That's really funny.
*  All right.
*  Thank you for coming on.
*  On that note, we won't talk about Bill Belichick's 20 something year old
*  girlfriend.
*  I know that's not true.
*  That.
*  Yeah.
*  Great to see you, Bellamy.
*  Congrats on the Dodgers.
*  Thank you.
