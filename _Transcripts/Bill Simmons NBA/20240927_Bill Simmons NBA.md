# Zach Lowe Laid Off By ESPN in Yet Another Confusing ESPN Move  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fSCjY_ryc8)
*  All right, Brian Curtis is here.
*  You can hear him on the press box.
*  He's the editor at large of The Ringer.
*  We've been working together since 2011.
*  We have some conflicts of interest to disclose
*  before we do this part of the podcast.
*  Zach Lowe, who worked with us at Grantland,
*  who I think was the best all around basketball person
*  who did this in the NBA, was let go by ESPN today.
*  It was a layoff.
*  It was another ESPN layoff.
*  There's been a few of these.
*  It's not like I've done a podcast every time
*  and I would say I'm friends with Zach,
*  but it just felt like there's a moment here with ESPN
*  that I felt like we should hit, and you agreed,
*  and we're just gonna talk about it.
*  So what was your reaction when you heard?
*  The first reaction was, wait a second.
*  You just renewed the NBA rights for $2.5 billion,
*  and then you laid off the best NBA writer in America
*  in the same breath?
*  That really happened?
*  Like a week and change after the biggest NBA newsbreaker
*  in America left the network?
*  And that was the first reaction.
*  And then the second reaction is something you and I said
*  over the years as we've seen these layoffs
*  and people walk out the door at Bristol is,
*  if ESPN doesn't have room for Zach Lowe,
*  who does ESPN have room for?
*  And who do they want in the room?
*  It's kind of the question, isn't it?
*  It's clearly a strategy,
*  and they clearly value certain things.
*  And I think everybody gets mad anytime something like this
*  happens, and I get it.
*  But to me, it's more interesting what the strategy is
*  and what they're thinking and where Zach fit into that.
*  Because obviously, and they had an issue with this
*  10 years ago when I was there.
*  They didn't know how to monetize podcasts,
*  they didn't know how to get it,
*  they didn't know how to get real value from them.
*  Zach's biggest value is as a writer and a podcaster
*  and a steward of the game,
*  and also somebody who can go on TV and be good.
*  But it seems like what they value now is people
*  who can do TV hits first and foremost,
*  and hits that you can cut into 70 to 90 second videos
*  that can go on their website or go on YouTube.
*  And the better the headline is for those hits,
*  that seems to be where the value is.
*  And I'm not besmirching some of the people
*  that do that stuff, I'm just saying that seems
*  to be how they value it, it's either that or the giant names
*  which you've covered many times in Ringerpieces,
*  like getting the best possible people
*  to cover a football game.
*  Spending money on the high end talent,
*  I'm sure they're gonna bring back Stephen A. Smith.
*  But I think that's what they're becoming.
*  I think what's so fascinating to me is that
*  it's the opposite of where they were 10 years ago,
*  when they seem to try to want to be everything,
*  but also really have, I guess,
*  for lack of a better word, a soul.
*  I'm not sure what the soul is gonna be
*  if this is what your strategy is.
*  So that's my big take.
*  TROY First of all, we should congratulate Zach
*  for inaugurating a whole new era of television
*  where you would come on television in your sweats.
*  Remember, he was doing that even before COVID.
*  It would be a TV hit and everybody be in their suits,
*  and we'd see Zach from his apartment,
*  and you'd be like, look at that.
*  That guy looks slightly different
*  than people I'm used to seeing on TV.
*  Now that's what we all do on Zoom.
*  So I completely agree with you,
*  and I think the strategy is fascinating because
*  ESPN, like every other media company in America,
*  is walking across this bridge
*  from the world of cable television
*  to the world of streaming and over the top.
*  And they're making a decision,
*  who's coming over the bridge with us?
*  Who do we want to be part of this new world?
*  And they've picked a couple of big guys,
*  the Stephen A's and the Pat McAfee's.
*  They've picked a ton of sports rights,
*  which they've done a good job signing out.
*  But the interesting question to me is like,
*  this all feels very TV oriented to me.
*  It feels like we're getting people to do these TV hits,
*  even though we're kind of admitting
*  we're not really a TV company anymore.
*  If Zach's value, if you're saying,
*  well, we can't see the value of him as like a TV guy
*  cutting up those 60 second clips
*  that now dominate the website.
*  But isn't there money to be made
*  with a Zach Lowe NBA podcast?
*  Like isn't that?
*  Apparently not.
*  If ESPN's selling it.
*  Yeah, I just find that weird.
*  But it's not, listen, it's not their business.
*  You know, and what you've seen a lot of that,
*  from a lot of the stuff they've been doing
*  the last five years is outsourcing stuff, right?
*  Omaha is producing more and more shows for them.
*  It's kind of insane.
*  Why aren't you producing your own shows?
*  You know, why are you constantly in like,
*  Connor left and his company does a bunch of 30 for 30s
*  and produces the ESPYs for them.
*  It's like, why aren't you guys doing this?
*  So on the one hand, they're outsourcing a bunch of stuff.
*  And then as concurrently,
*  they seem like they're throwing away
*  at least the podcast piece of everything.
*  They have podcasts, they have a bunch of them,
*  but it doesn't seem like they care
*  because if they cared, they would have kept Zach.
*  So when you talk about this new world that they're entering,
*  the world is sports rights and just enough people
*  to seem like you're still the biggest.
*  Is that what it is?
*  It's totally flipped, hasn't it?
*  Because remember old ESPN,
*  they didn't really have the games you wanted to watch,
*  but they had the people you wanted to listen to.
*  And new ESPN now has all the games you want to watch.
*  They have the Super Bowl in 2027,
*  they have the NBA finals,
*  they have all these huge packages,
*  but they don't really have the people
*  that you want to hear talk about the games a lot of the time.
*  Still plenty of good people there.
*  I don't want to write everybody off.
*  By the way, how many times have we been playing that game,
*  you and I over the last 10 years, where we say,
*  you know what, at least ESPN has,
*  and then we fill in the blank with somebody everybody likes.
*  Dots, yeah.
*  At least they still have Mina.
*  At least they still have Wickersham.
*  And Zach was on that list before today.
*  And that list is getting really, really small.
*  But what, I mean, what's the point of having
*  hardcore feature journalism at this point anymore?
*  So you're going to dabble in that every once in a while,
*  but not always have it?
*  Or are you going to have some of it?
*  Are you going to have a new version of it?
*  That's another thing.
*  I just, my point is, I don't understand the strategy.
*  I feel like I've always understood,
*  at least somewhat, what they're doing.
*  And now it seems like their strategy is
*  five different things happening at the same time,
*  because now they're on the gambling side too, right?
*  So they got in super late on that,
*  probably like four years ago,
*  doesn't seem like they're in on podcasts the same way.
*  Seems like they're really in on the YouTube, TikTok,
*  all that social stuff.
*  And that seems to be the thing they point to
*  when they talk about success things.
*  They also talk about how the ratings are up,
*  but we all know the ratings are up
*  because they started counting bar TVs and airport TVs
*  and things like that.
*  The ratings aren't actually up.
*  It's just the way they count the ratings, it's more people.
*  But I do wonder, like, to me, the next one is,
*  PTI.
*  What happens with that show?
*  Because we're seeing a certain shift
*  toward a certain type of content.
*  And where does PTI and two old guys that are beloved
*  and institutions at the place who are one of a kind
*  and the show is always the best
*  when Will Bonacorn has her on it.
*  Where do those guys fit going forward?
*  And this is the first time I wouldn't be surprised
*  they're just like, yeah, we got rid of Will Bonacorn.
*  And I'm like, yeah, we got rid of him.
*  We got rid of Will Bonacorn as a.
*  Two guys that were grandfathered in.
*  No offense to Mike and Tony from another age of television.
*  But to me, the whole daytime ESPN is a real question, right?
*  Cause when, in the cable TV universe, what did you do?
*  You just turned on ESPN.
*  And for a lot of it was just on all day.
*  So that floated a certain kind of programming
*  during the day.
*  Is that gonna exist?
*  When we get in the streaming world
*  at four in the afternoon, just when there's not a game on it,
*  you just say, I just wanna put ESPN on
*  be the background noise.
*  So I think you're right.
*  Like that show doesn't fit in with what the
*  Potaro regime vision of ESPN has been.
*  But I also just think ESPN is probably just changing
*  in a very, very fundamental way.
*  And I don't know how much daytime ESPN there's gonna be
*  cause that's really one of the only things left
*  besides around the horn.
*  Well, what we haven't seen streaming sports stuff,
*  just talking head stuff work for people like,
*  I will go to Peacock and watch this.
*  I will go to Paramount and watch.
*  People aren't doing that.
*  I'll go, oh, Max says that they don't.
*  But people are in the habit,
*  maybe this is older people and maybe it's not people 25
*  and under of, oh, I'm just gonna put ESPN on.
*  And I wonder if maybe that's starting to fade too.
*  So it just feels like it's getting louder and more distinct.
*  But on the other hand, they're still taking swings.
*  Like they're spending more money on the main cast, right?
*  Yeah.
*  They took a bunch of swings with their NBA coverage.
*  None of them worked.
*  They went and they spent money on Doc Rivers.
*  Like they went, they doubled down on JJ.
*  They were paying Woj as much money as anybody.
*  But now you think like the last year,
*  I mean, just NBA in general, the last year,
*  they lose Doc, they lose JJ.
*  They lose their lead color analyst twice
*  after firing Van Gundy, right?
*  Woj is just gone.
*  Now Zach Low's gone.
*  It's just, it's kinda, your brain's spinning.
*  And now I guess what we're gonna get,
*  and I like Stephen A, so this is not a slighted Stephen A.
*  And I really think he's a good guy,
*  but it feels like they're moving toward,
*  it's a Knicks playoff game.
*  Here's Stephen A's entrance.
*  And that's kind of what they think people want.
*  And I don't think they're right.
*  No, how did that go over with Jason Kelsey
*  during the Eagles game the other day?
*  And people were just like, I don't want this.
*  This is too much.
*  They were trying so hard.
*  Yeah, and I liked Jason Kelsey,
*  but I didn't like the way they used them.
*  And then he stayed in the booth
*  and all of a sudden Aikman's gone
*  from a game that was really good,
*  because as soon as somebody's in a booth,
*  you know this, they have to interview him.
*  And Jason, nobody knows better than you
*  that that tush push, you just have to figure out ways
*  to work the guy in.
*  It's like, fucking Aikman are the best
*  announcing team we have.
*  What are you guys doing?
*  Can we talk about the center some more?
*  This is great, great content.
*  Keep going with this.
*  I wanna come back to your idea about the soul of ESPN.
*  Because I think that is a really interesting question.
*  Because when you write stuff like this
*  or say stuff like this, ESPN will come back.
*  But did you see the rights package we just signed?
*  Did you see how we got the entire SEC,
*  the entire college football playoff?
*  Man, they have lost so many things about ESPN
*  that made it unique over the last decade and plus.
*  I put a list together a couple of years ago
*  when we did a piece about ESPN layoffs,
*  one of the many stories I've read about it.
*  Dude, when you just look at the list,
*  Simmons, Rosillo, the Grantland gang,
*  okay, that's inside the house here.
*  Michael Jamel, Dan Lebatard, Keith Oberman,
*  Wesley Morris, Matthew Barry, Mark Stein, Chad Ford.
*  You wanna keep going?
*  Chris Felica, Tom Rinaldi, like Mike,
*  did I say Toreko already?
*  Adam Amin, Jason Benetti, I mean like,
*  Bomani, both Mike Golicks.
*  I could go on and on and on.
*  Just think.
*  Three Mike Golicks.
*  I think there's four Mike Golicks.
*  Many, many Mike Golicks.
*  Just think of how many people walked out the door.
*  And again, your mileage may vary on some of those people
*  and I totally understand that,
*  but it's like people have fewer entry points
*  to get into ESPN, right?
*  That was part of the cool thing about old ESPN.
*  You could like this and not like this,
*  but you'd still be in the ESPN mothership
*  because you're like, I like Bill.
*  I like Rosillo.
*  I like this.
*  I like Mike and Mike in the morning.
*  This is my entry point.
*  Those people are all gone.
*  Right.
*  Well, you know what else was interesting about it is
*  it seems like there's a certain,
*  granted Twitter is Twitter,
*  but I did notice Zach was trending today,
*  but it also said he was trending with Kendrick Perkins.
*  And that was one of the interesting topics of this, right?
*  Is that people were looking at this like ESPN is choosing
*  this Kendrick Perkins direction of their basketball coverage
*  over the Zach Low direction.
*  I don't even know.
*  I mean, look, there's a million reasons
*  why something like this can happen,
*  but I don't necessarily blame Kendrick
*  for some of the stuff he says,
*  or the way he's trying to provoke people
*  because they're telling him to do that.
*  If you're telling, if you're being produced a certain way,
*  if you're being incentivized a certain way
*  and you're on TV and you want to gain more and more,
*  whatever, power, you want to be on TV more,
*  you want to make more money,
*  you're going to do what the people are like, that was great.
*  I loved what you said about how Jason Tatum is in an alpha.
*  Just stare in the camera and do that again for 90 seconds.
*  And that's just the way this shit's going to go.
*  So there's really like for the people that bitch about it,
*  just don't watch.
*  That's really the only way any of this stuff's going to change.
*  If you don't like this direction, wherever we're going,
*  you don't have to watch it.
*  I don't watch this stuff in the morning anymore.
*  Do you?
*  Do you watch in their morning shows?
*  So little, I mean, so little and I only see the clips
*  and then it's that 45 second clip you're talking about.
*  Perk goes off on Jason Tatum.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  But look, it's not, you're right.
*  It's not a one for one trade.
*  It's not like they say, okay, we can either pick Perk
*  or we can pick Zach and only one of them can stay.
*  I don't think it quite works like that.
*  But it's not not that either.
*  Because just like you said,
*  they figured out what they want, right?
*  Some of those people are good or Lofsky, people like that.
*  But like we want that guy and give us 45 seconds,
*  really good meaty seconds.
*  And then we're going to put that on the website.
*  That's going to be the new article for us.
*  Other articles.
*  Like right now there's a video, Perk.
*  Nobody is scared of the Celtics.
*  Jason Tatum.
*  It's like what?
*  Nobody's scared of the Celtics?
*  Click.
*  That's kind of where we're going now.
*  And I don't know.
*  It, it, it.
*  Maybe we're like the, the older people now
*  who are nostalgic for some era that's just gone anyway.
*  But I do feel like, especially when we were there
*  10 years ago, like they did, they did care about
*  the big picture of some of this stuff.
*  And now it seems like they intermittently care.
*  See, I don't feel like an old guy on this because like
*  you and I being old guys be like,
*  where's the original edition of the Sports Reporters?
*  We're, when it had, when it had the guys from the Chicago
*  Tribune, that's what I wanted to see.
*  We're talking about Zach freaking Lowe, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you want to reach young basketball fans?
*  Isn't that one of the ways to do it?
*  Yeah. And also like somebody that was a real,
*  a thought leader and inspiration to a whole generation of,
*  of people and also a fucking awesome guy.
*  Like, right.
*  We, we worked with them.
*  Like the guy gives a shit.
*  He puts in his time.
*  He's not a look at me, look at me.
*  He's a really generous teammate.
*  He just does so many, there's just so many good things
*  that come with working with that guy that if you don't
*  appreciate that, that's, that's nuts.
*  I just don't, I don't understand that.
*  But you know, part of me wonders,
*  like the evil side of me wonders, do they do this knowing
*  somebody else is going to pick them up
*  and they're just off the hook?
*  It's almost like when baseball teams leave, you know,
*  they're right field, they're unprotected on the waiver wire
*  knowing somebody might actually claim them.
*  Yeah. Whole timing of this is weird.
*  He was the only guy that they didn't do, they, they laid off
*  right before this whole end of the quarter thing.
*  Nobody else was in it.
*  They're back channeling and telling people, no, no,
*  this is part of the RG three Sam Ponder thing.
*  It is. Why don't, why didn't you do this two months ago then?
*  Yeah. You're doing it right before the NBA season.
*  He, he was on NBA today.
*  He did a podcast with JJ Reddick yesterday.
*  So what are you doing?
*  It's funny to your point, like I had somebody text me today.
*  It's like, it's not a bad time to be an NBA media free agent
*  right now, given what's happening with all the rights,
*  you know, there are people out there in a year
*  who might going to want people.
*  I've heard that, but like look at Amazon's NFL coverage.
*  There's no reporter on that stuff.
*  They just have ex players and a host.
*  So now we're going to-
*  Is this Alba we're erasure bill?
*  But you know what I mean?
*  Like it's not like there's going to be 40 jobs.
*  It's not like they're going to have some whole universe
*  built around like reporting stuff.
*  And I don't know.
*  It's, I wish I could explain ESPN and I just can't.
*  The gambling thing I think was, was the first sign
*  that maybe they were just outright missing on stuff,
*  you know, and when you just have to keep doing this
*  over and over again and rebooting who you are
*  and what you're trying to be.
*  Now, now they've pinned themselves in a position
*  where they basically have to keep them.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  He can name his price.
*  And I don't-
*  He's coming across the bridge.
*  I mean, like I said, when we're talking about people
*  who are going to be part of the new ESPN,
*  Steven A's part of it.
*  Yeah, that has to be.
*  But there's also like a little bit of a lawlessness
*  that as somebody who was suspended for three weeks
*  and suspended on Twitter a couple of times.
*  And, you know, I look back at some of the stuff I did.
*  It wasn't one 10th as bad as some of the stuff
*  that people are now like Ryan Clark,
*  like openly challenging them about his extension.
*  I, I, I'm just there.
*  I, do they have bosses?
*  What's happening?
*  But this is the thing, right?
*  It's the players coach year of ESPN too,
*  where the people we pick, we pick them
*  and we kind of just let them do what they want.
*  We're not worried about-
*  Including if they want to have a sex tape on Instagram.
*  What the-
*  That's fine.
*  I'll look the other way on that one.
*  Is it going to be a first take Tuesday?
*  Okay, cool.
*  Oh my God.
*  Uncle was getting it on.
*  It's just, I just don't understand it.
*  Like who's in charge?
*  What are you trying to do?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's what, that's what I say.
*  And again, like I said, every time I say these words
*  and you know, we've had some moments here.
*  I believe I had a column called ESPN's Year from Hell
*  a little bit earlier in 2024.
*  Look at the sign, just sign the sports rights.
*  Just, just re-sign the college,
*  got the whole college football playoff.
*  I mean, that's what ESPN is now, right?
*  It's the games you want to see.
*  That's, if you're looking for a strategy,
*  the strategy is the games you want to see,
*  a handful of guys who host talk shows
*  and we'll figure out the rest.
*  Well, I wonder if it's almost like what happened
*  with movies in the 2000s.
*  They're like, let's just do franchises.
*  Let's, instead of spending money on these 10 movies
*  and hoping one of them hits,
*  let's just go get a fucking DC Comics thing going
*  and we'll make Lethal Weapon 7
*  and we'll just do some sequels
*  and let's everybody turn our brains off
*  and not try to make good stuff.
*  With ESPN's version of that is sports rights.
*  Like, hey, we have all the sports rights.
*  It doesn't really matter who's announcing them
*  except for football.
*  And it doesn't really matter what the shows are around them
*  because people are going to watch the games anyway
*  and we're fine.
*  Yeah, I do come back to like,
*  you just spent so much money on the NBA.
*  So the NBA is one of your franchises.
*  That's one of your Marvel franchises at ESPN.
*  So don't you want the best people around it
*  even if they're not my brain?
*  Surely you want other people around there to...
*  Yeah, but they just had the most rollercoastery, rocky
*  kind of behind the scenes year ever
*  covering the league last year, right?
*  Did it ultimately matter?
*  People are still walking.
*  They're like, I'm not watching game four tonight.
*  There's too much chaos at ESPN.
*  People don't care.
*  Like ultimately they could have,
*  JJ's leaving and they have woes reporting on it
*  and it's this whole basically internally created soap opera
*  around the Laker job that they're just getting clicks out of
*  and it was annoying, but it didn't stop people
*  from watching the finals.
*  Now you're sounding like the ESPN management
*  because you're going, oh, well, it doesn't matter.
*  We'll just, as long as we have the games.
*  I'm just trying to figure out what they're thinking.
*  Yeah, I think that's what they're thinking.
*  It's like, guess what?
*  People are going to watch sports
*  and the UFC deal is going to come up.
*  We're going to redo that.
*  We're going to have UFC, we're going to have NBA
*  and we have college football
*  and we have WNBA now, which is growing big time
*  and on and on and on and we have sports all the time
*  and that's why people come
*  and we've done a million research models on this
*  and this is what people want.
*  Where they missed was the ESPN bet
*  because they just got in too late.
*  They have no chance with that.
*  I completely agree, but you know what?
*  This sucks because it's Zach and Zach's great.
*  So it just sucks.
*  Like it's not fun and it's not, again,
*  your soul just got to keep coming back to that word
*  because you just look at ESPN like,
*  I want to visit ESPN a little bit less today.
*  It's not going to die.
*  ESPN is not over.
*  There's no need to go in
*  for the full think peace treatment here,
*  but it just, it's a little worse today.
*  Maybe a lot worse without him.
*  What do people say?
*  Cause you talk to everybody
*  and you've been at the forefront
*  of smartly writing about sports media
*  and not going crazy and not getting caught into like,
*  I have this scoop, but just trying to write big picture
*  takes about where things are going
*  and where things are leaning and where things are moving
*  and what little trends are happening
*  and trying to explain why this happened,
*  incorporating the history of things.
*  What, when people talk to you about ESPN,
*  what are the most common things they ask you?
*  Well, it's interesting because before,
*  I think 10 years ago and certainly like 15 years ago,
*  it felt like the ultimate destination.
*  And especially became in the 2010s,
*  the ultimate destination for sports writers,
*  not just for people who wanted
*  to be the next sports center anchor,
*  which was kind of a funny flip, right?
*  ESPN became the worldwide leader in sports writing
*  for a pretty long patch there.
*  And you and I were both a part of that.
*  You much obviously much more than me,
*  but you know what's funny is when I talk to people now,
*  very few of them say, talk about ESPN
*  as a place they aspire to work at.
*  And it's not that they think ESPN is bad.
*  I just don't think they think that's attainable anymore.
*  Right.
*  They just don't see that as like a logical pathway.
*  Because again, if you don't have room for Zach,
*  do you have room for me?
*  It just doesn't compute.
*  So I think for a certain type of person,
*  it's just not even on the bingo card anymore
*  as a place they would work.
*  The other piece of it,
*  and we'll see if Shams is a part of this,
*  whether they wanna stay in the information business
*  in the post-Wozhe era.
*  Some people in my life were like,
*  Wozhe, maybe he knew he was getting laid off
*  and they gave him a heads up and he got out.
*  That's not what happened.
*  I think he was genuinely,
*  there's no conspiracy theory on Wozhe.
*  I think he was burned out
*  and I think he just wanted to do the same honest thing,
*  felt like he made enough money.
*  But this information culture that they've created,
*  where all that matter was getting those scoops,
*  which you and I never really understood.
*  And I'll be interested to see
*  if they break away from that or not.
*  I think the big scoops matter.
*  If you know somebody's getting traded,
*  like a major player's getting traded.
*  If you know a team's getting sold.
*  If you know somebody's gonna retire.
*  But when it comes down to Isaac Okoro
*  assigned a three-year, $38 million extension
*  negotiated by Brian Curtis of Curtis Agent Media.
*  That's where you lose me.
*  So I wonder, are they going to double down
*  on this information era
*  or maybe start shifting away from that too?
*  My guess would be they'll start shifting away.
*  Maybe.
*  Can you think they can unhook themselves from the machine
*  that they hooked themselves up to with Wozhe and Schefter
*  and Jeff Passan and everybody else?
*  What's the upside of it?
*  So the upside is you're not being embarrassed
*  that other people are getting the scoops, right?
*  But I mean, I'm not ashamed to admit,
*  like at The Ringer, we've never cared about that stuff
*  because our theory was always,
*  well, this stuff will come out and then we'll react to it.
*  Right?
*  We want to have the best,
*  this happened, what do you think, people?
*  We don't really care if we have the people
*  who are burning the phone lines trying to break information.
*  So I guess from ESPN standpoint,
*  I know it was important to have Wozhe.
*  On the other hand, a lot of the stuff was his Twitter feed,
*  which isn't on ESPN and they're not really able
*  to monetize in any way.
*  Now he can give them a heads up, stuff's coming.
*  He can do like a Monday morning,
*  I'm about to do this, nobody has it, get ready.
*  For the most part, unless it's like a giant thing,
*  I don't really see the, I don't see the upside.
*  I don't personally get it.
*  What do you think?
*  I never have.
*  I mean, I've never seen it other than what you mentioned,
*  which is having the name of a rival media company
*  on the bottom line where you have to credit them
*  when they break something,
*  which is obviously what drove them nuts about it.
*  I always say Jim Wozhearski reports, dot, dot, dot.
*  Which completely drove them bonkers
*  when they had to do that,
*  but I had a fantasy on PressBox last week
*  and we were talking about this,
*  having them on the same conversation and he's like,
*  I don't get it.
*  Not only why do you necessarily want that,
*  why do you want somebody at that price point
*  that you have to pay them to be the ultimate insider?
*  Because even if it's Shomps coming over,
*  that's gonna be a lot of money.
*  I mean, that's millions of dollars, right?
*  So you're going to, here's the time of the company when it's tight, when,
*  when you're trying to cut talent salaries, do you want that much money just to have
*  the pride of not having it on the bottom line? Is that it? You know, cause you're going to do,
*  I think that's literally it. I don't think there's another reason. I mean,
*  I think it's about if we're supposed to be the worldwide leader, how do we not have this stuff?
*  But you know, I think what happened to woesha's career the last 15 years is pretty informative,
*  right? From 2010 to 2014, he was a really fearless basketball journalist, right? He,
*  he operated a lot like how Matt Bellamy is, is writing his Hollywood column now for puck. Like
*  he was, he was really well-sourced, but he also didn't play favorites and in favorite trade,
*  didn't do any of that stuff. And within 10 years, favorite trading was the business.
*  And I think, I honestly feel like that was part of the reason you probably got out because I think
*  in your DNA, if you want to be a reporter and you want to be fearless to shift the other way,
*  we're now everything is a favorite trade. I don't know how you can do that for that long.
*  It's funny. I was talking to Sean about this the other day, but the amazing thing about
*  insiders to me is also you can never say, I don't know. You know, when something breaks or when
*  there's something going on, you can never come on television and be like, I don't know the answer
*  to the question. Right. We know as journalists, even if we think we have sources, there are times
*  when you just don't know. You really don't say there's a lot of times, a lot of times, right?
*  But you all there's this idea that not only do you have to like, I can't take my phone in the
*  shower or whatever that thing you were laughing about the other day was, but you just can't say,
*  I don't know, because then all the magic disappears. You're not the almighty insider
*  anymore. What you don't know. You don't know what's about to happen. And to me, that's always just
*  like, Oh, like what? You know, just a strange existence for anybody to be in. Well, part of
*  us as journalists, part of me is thinking like, if this does end, there are some benefits, right?
*  Like we could watch an NBA or NFL draft and not have any picks, every pick spoiled, right? We,
*  we could have TV pregame shows where we don't have to like awkwardly shoehorn the insider to be like,
*  I am hearing that Memphis is very interested in a center. Um, and we could, I don't know,
*  just talk about other stuff, but, uh, but the big picture point we're heading in 25 with this new,
*  this new streaming only ESPN thing. And it just feels like this is like the Zach Lowe moment
*  feels like something we'll remember where we're like, Oh, remember ESPN was creeping this way.
*  And then they laid off Zach and then they went this way. And I think I see that it feels like
*  you do too, which is why we want to do this segment. I do. It feels important, right? Even
*  if again, that whole list I just gave you of people that have walked out the door for some
*  reason, this one hits a little bit differently. It does. And maybe, maybe it is, maybe it's the
*  beginning of something. Maybe it's maybe we'll look back when we look at ESPN 2030, where holograms
*  are doing sports center and the AI write-ups have gone way beyond what they're doing now that
*  this will be a moment. I totally can feel that. Well, they have some good stuff going still.
*  They still have all the rights, which is really the only thing that matters.
*  They whiffed on ESPN radio. They, it seems like they've whiffed on the podcast business,
*  but the YouTube and the Tik TOK and the Snapchat and you name any sort of thing that has risen over
*  the last 12 years, they're in there in the best possible ways. And maybe that's their business.
*  And maybe people like us just don't see it. You know, they obviously see some sort of vision.
*  That's different than I think what, what we see. Maybe we're the dinosaurs.
*  Like I said, I don't, I feel like the old guy with you sometimes. I don't feel like the old guy right
*  now. I don't, I don't defending, defending Zach Lowe doesn't make me feel old. That makes me feel
*  young. If anything. How about Skip Bayless unemployed that that's got to make you feel old.
*  Did I put his name on the list of people walked out the door? Yeah. There's another one. Yeah.
*  There's another one. Yeah. The end of the skip Bayless careers. That's that now that's my first,
*  my first guy when I was a kid, man, I'm gonna tell you that would have been a great eight episode
*  podcast series that only like seven people would have loved. Like the, the, the rise rise and
*  whatever of skip Bayless, but going into the, those Dallas Cowboys years. Oh my God. He wrote
*  three Cowboys books in like five years. And I have all of them. And so do you really good.
*  Yeah. They're actually really good books. They got kind of a bad rap. It was just that era where
*  you could just get crazy inside access with the football team, or you didn't know how true some
*  of the access was, but that's what made it fun to read. He told me one time the Cowboys did their
*  first super bowl in the Jerry Jimmy era. He had breakfast with Jerry Jones, the day of the super
*  bowl. Just think about that now at the hotel. Yeah, that happened. Are you worried about the
*  Cowboys? Hell yes. You kidding? I see not worried resigned. We're taking this before the giants
*  game. They might beat the giants like 45 to 10 today. I'm the opposite of cousin Sal, where he's
*  like having the flicker of hope, keep the, keep hope alive. I'm just resigned. I mean, I'm,
*  I'm, I'm out. I just think it's done. I know, I know. I still think there's like a, you know,
*  a nine win slip into the playoff scenario, but that's about all I'm hopeful for. By the way,
*  I had a nitpick you and you and fantasy did your top campaign movies on your pod. Dave is not a
*  campaign movie. Dave's being an office movie. That's fucking cheating. There was no campaign
*  in Dave CC Sean fantasy. Well, that's just that. That's just a lazy and B he cheated,
*  which is par for the course of that guy. He's just going to try to win. He's going to try to
*  win with however he does it. Dave, where's the campaign and Dave that I miss it was in a deleted
*  scene. He's just in office. What the fuck is he doing? Come on, fantasy. Uh, Curtis, good to see
*  you. It's good to see you too, Bill.
