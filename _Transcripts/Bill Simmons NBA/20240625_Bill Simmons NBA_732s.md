# Did the Bulls Win the Giddey-Caruso Trade? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc)
*  Since the last time we talked, we're still okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=0.0s)]
*  C traded Josh Giddy for Alex Grusso trade that happened a couple of days ago. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=2.2s)]
*  I've not talked about on the podcast and the consensus seemed to be. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=5.64s)]
*  How did okay. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=10.08s)]
*  C get this done without throwing in anything else? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=10.8s)]
*  Why didn't they throw in picks? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=14.0s)]
*  This is even a hot take. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=16.4s)]
*  It's it feels like a zag and I'm not even sure. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  It's feels like a hot zag. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I thought Chicago won the trade. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=24.28s)]
*  I like getting, I do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=26.12s)]
*  I like getting he's 21 years old. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=29.32s)]
*  Um, to me, this was like one of the all time buying low MBA trades. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=32.36s)]
*  Of this century year two, age 20, 17, eight and six, 48% super competitive. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  They had like nobody, they had no center. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=47.56s)]
*  They went 40 and 42. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=49.36s)]
*  That guy was fucking bringing it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=50.72s)]
*  Went through all the off the court stuff, which I think fucked his season up. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=52.64s)]
*  Um, and by the way, not great for him, but I think, you know, it got the year [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=56.56s)]
*  off to a bad start combined with the team was better SGA had the ball a lot. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=61.68s)]
*  And he started to get marginalized as the year went along 21 years old last year. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=66.08s)]
*  But I want to, I went and looked at 21 under under guys who average 15, six [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=71.48s)]
*  and six and played 60 plus games. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=76.72s)]
*  Here's the list. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=78.52s)]
*  Luca three times, LeBron twice magic, Lamelo, Ben Simmons and Josh [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=79.8s)]
*  Giddy in the history of the league. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=84.2s)]
*  If you go 20 and under, which he did as a sophomore, Luca twice magic, LeBron, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=86.2s)]
*  Lamelo, Josh Giddy, I just think people forgot that he's actually good. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=90.96s)]
*  And he was in a weird situation, um, on a team that didn't really need him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=95.36s)]
*  And now he's going to a team. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=100.08s)]
*  That's not that good. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=101.32s)]
*  That's going to be like, yo, Josh Giddy, we think you're good. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=102.48s)]
*  Here's the ball. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=104.88s)]
*  And I think he was an asset. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=106.56s)]
*  So what'd you think? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=108.2s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=110.88s)]
*  Oh, we didn't talk about this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=112.2s)]
*  No, we didn't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=114.36s)]
*  I couldn't believe seeing it play out in real time on Twitter. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=115.36s)]
*  I was like, wait, so everybody just thinks Josh Giddy sucks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=118.76s)]
*  Now, if you go on recent events, he couldn't stay on the floor in the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=121.4s)]
*  playoff game because he was the one guy that Dallas decided we're just [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=124.68s)]
*  not going to defend you at all. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=128.4s)]
*  And when you start running into those problems where it's somebody [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=130.68s)]
*  you don't even care about, and we've seen this happen plenty of times [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=132.8s)]
*  with teams that happened with Cleveland against the Knicks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=135.72s)]
*  It's just like, you know what? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=138.28s)]
*  We actually aren't even going to bother with you at all. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=139.08s)]
*  And then, okay, see, he's kind of stuck with having to get them out of there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=141.52s)]
*  By the way, 28 of the 30 teams have a guy like that every year, and they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  have to learn how to make that guy work in their offense. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=149.76s)]
*  And it's like, all right, you're our guy who teams are going to be okay [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  leaving your loans, how are you going to affect it? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  And him off the ball all the time, because SGA is so good on the ball. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=158.32s)]
*  Jaylen's going to get a bunch of possessions where he's initiating something. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=163.48s)]
*  Giddy off the ball is diminished version of him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  But when he played, when he went on that run, when SGA was out, he was incredible. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=177.84s)]
*  Now the off the court stuff also destroyed his rep. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what to make of it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=183.44s)]
*  I know they investigated it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=184.84s)]
*  They said it was done. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  You can believe whatever you want. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=187.36s)]
*  I don't know what to believe on that one, but that clearly plays into just the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=188.28s)]
*  general Q rating of Josh Giddy during this trade. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  Now, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, and they also seems like, it seems like they told him like, you're going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  to be the sixth man next year if you play for us and he's like, I don't [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=200.12s)]
*  want to be the sixth man. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  I feel like I could be one of the best three guys on a team, which led to the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=204.56s)]
*  trade. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=207.24s)]
*  I mean, Sam was pretty honest about that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=207.8s)]
*  I think because OKC had so many picks, people were like, how could you not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  get a pick? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  But it's like, so wait, if you did the trade with a team that didn't have picks, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=214.88s)]
*  what's OKC supposed to do? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=220.12s)]
*  Just give you some. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=223.52s)]
*  We'll give you the Charlotte pick we have in 28. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=224.16s)]
*  I mean, house want to. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=226.32s)]
*  We do have a lot. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=226.84s)]
*  House wanted Giddy for the number two pick, like for real. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=228.56s)]
*  That was his dream scenario for the second pick in the draft. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=231.4s)]
*  I just think the stuff Giddy did, and I saw him in person a couple of times the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=234.76s)]
*  first two years of his career. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=239.56s)]
*  And I just like how he plays. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=241.92s)]
*  You know, he can, he's, he's a small forward, but he's also a point guard. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=243.88s)]
*  It doesn't really matter. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=247.72s)]
*  He's tall. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=249.56s)]
*  He rebounds. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=250.28s)]
*  He just fills the box score. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  He's fun to play with the ball, moves with him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=253.32s)]
*  And I think if, if you're going to dig him on anything, it's like, yeah, he's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  not good enough three point shooter yet. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=258.84s)]
*  Well, he's 21. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Like Jalen Brown couldn't shoot when he came into the league. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=262.4s)]
*  That was the reason people thought he was going to go seventh or eighth in the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  draft because he couldn't hit a jump shot. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=268.08s)]
*  And people are like, well, if he learns how to shoot, he'll be an asset. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=270.84s)]
*  Well, now he learned how to shoot. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=273.44s)]
*  Um, I just thought for Caruso, who's an expiring contract, who everybody seemed [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=275.56s)]
*  to think they wanted like three, four first round picks, well, you know, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=280.96s)]
*  they never got them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=285.4s)]
*  They never got two first round picks for them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=286.28s)]
*  And then as you're going into the last year, your deal, it was a really good [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=288.52s)]
*  trade for OKC, like everybody made the Derek White true holiday comparison. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=291.44s)]
*  I totally get it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=295.36s)]
*  Thought it was smart. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=296.44s)]
*  I think it was the right time to move off of Giddy, but I also thought the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=297.24s)]
*  Bulls bought really low on them and they're a bad team to begin with. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=300.44s)]
*  So it's like, all right, now we have Kobe White, we have Josh Giddy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=304.12s)]
*  We have the 11th pick. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=307.28s)]
*  Probably have to figure out a way to get rid of Levine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=309.32s)]
*  DeRozan's probably leaving. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=311.84s)]
*  Maybe we can trade Bootsch for somebody, but at least now they're like moving [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=313.12s)]
*  in a direction that makes sense to me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=316.12s)]
*  Cause we talked about that two weeks ago. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=318.24s)]
*  No, I'm saying like they're not trying to, I don't think they're [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=320.4s)]
*  trying to be a contender now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=323.12s)]
*  I think they're looking at let's. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=324.56s)]
*  Let's actually try to rebuild this a little bit. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=327.4s)]
*  Would you trade Patrick Williams for the number one pick? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=329.56s)]
*  I would not. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=334.12s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=336.4s)]
*  Um, I think Giddy's good though. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=337.68s)]
*  You wouldn't trade the pick, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=339.08s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=341.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=342.24s)]
*  Uh, I like getting more than Twitter did for a night. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=343.76s)]
*  So. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=346.56s)]
*  So can you go SGA, Dort, Caruso, JDub and Chet at crunch time for four straight [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=348.76s)]
*  rounds? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Cause my answer would be no. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=356.48s)]
*  I need, I need two more guys that give me a little big, small flexibility and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  they have the 12th pick in the draft. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=363.24s)]
*  They have cap space. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=365.16s)]
*  And I think what they do this summer is going to determine what their ceiling is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=367.12s)]
*  as could they make the finals or not? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=371.32s)]
*  But they need, they need the ability to go big or small. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=373.04s)]
*  And right now they can really, from what I see only go smaller lineup with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=375.12s)]
*  chat, which is what we saw last year. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=379.0s)]
*  And they couldn't get a big rebound when it mattered. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=380.48s)]
*  Crusoe would be better fit for them than Giddy, but they there's still [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=382.48s)]
*  one more piece for them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=385.24s)]
*  And I want to see what that is. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=387.24s)]
*  A Jordan Clarkson type. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=388.56s)]
*  I think they need another on-ball guy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=390.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  I think they need someone else. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=393.72s)]
*  And I think that's what they were hoping Gordon Hayward could be a little bit. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  And it doesn't have to be like Clarkson eventually became better. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=398.6s)]
*  With others where Clarkson had some moments in his career where it's like, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=402.44000000000005s)]
*  does not play well with others, but he could just score. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=406.36s)]
*  And when I watched the Dallas series, as great as SGA was, and I know that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  Jaylen just was disappointing and he was, he'll be better next year. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=418.68s)]
*  I, I'd imagine, but it felt like they need, they need another guy that can kind [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=419.24s)]
*  of initiate his own offense a little bit more, and hopefully that's not another [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  rookie. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=429.04s)]
*  Maybe that could be Jaylen Williams. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=429.4s)]
*  Would you trade the number 12 pick for Brook Lopez? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=436.08s)]
*  One year left on his deal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=438.64s)]
*  Devin Carter's gone. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=442.52s)]
*  Dalton connects gone. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=444.2s)]
*  Imagine Cody Williams probably gone by then. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=447.32s)]
*  Probably somebody good is sitting there at 12. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=450.12s)]
*  You wouldn't do it? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=452.91999999999996s)]
*  I'd say, I don't think so. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, this is the kind of content that you love the most off this giddy Caruso trade. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=455.44s)]
*  This is when you're the happiest to be in the pod right now, because I'm about [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  to do a deep dive for you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=466.23999999999995s)]
*  I tried to figure out whether this was the greatest one for one white guy [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  trade in the history of the league. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=471.2s)]
*  Ah, I love this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=473.4s)]
*  And I went through all the trades and the answer is no, because it's not [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=474.88s)]
*  in the answer is no, because in 1966, I liked Bailey Howell from Mel [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  Counts straight up a little bit more. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=488.36s)]
*  And I think Mel counts was white. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm not positive, but I think he was, but, uh, that was Baltimore, Boston. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  The Celtics get Bailey Howell. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=497.56s)]
*  They make the 1967, he makes the 1967 all star team. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=500.6s)]
*  They don't win the title. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  He averages 20 a game, 67, 68, 69. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=506.8s)]
*  They win two titles with them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=509.76000000000005s)]
*  Mel counts lands on the 68 Lakers and starts in the NBA finals. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's the greatest one for one. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=517.28s)]
*  We'll see if giddy and Cruz. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  So can surpass it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=520.6s)]
*  But I went through it's, it's pretty rare. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=522.72s)]
*  It's hard to find the one for winners with the white guys. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=524.64s)]
*  Dolph Shays not involved in any, no, a lot of career stability for him. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=529.12s)]
*  I thought for sure it was going to be like a Paul Westfall for somebody. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=535.76s)]
*  And I just, just couldn't find it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=539.24s)]
*  So if anyone out there can find a better one for one white guy trade, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=542.84s)]
*  please by all means, let us know. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=546.12s)]
*  Um, speaking of Chicago, we're going to do a little, what would you do with [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  Chicago? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=553.4s)]
*  Cause right now you have Kobe white, Josh Gideon, the 11th pick, you [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  have Vucevich 20 and 21. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=558.0s)]
*  You have Levine and a terrible contract. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=561.08s)]
*  You have the Rosen is a free agent. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=563.16s)]
*  You have Lonzo 21 million expiring. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=564.52s)]
*  You have all your picks except your 25 top 10 protected to San Antonio, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=567.24s)]
*  which I'm sure they're going to keep. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=571.12s)]
*  And I'm sure part of maybe what they're thinking about next season is let's try [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=572.52s)]
*  to keep that top 10 pick in an absolutely loaded draft. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=576.12s)]
*  What would you do if you're Chicago? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=581.12s)]
*  What are your next two moves? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=582.36s)]
*  You just turned Caruso into Josh Gideon. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  Now what? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  Dump Levine maybe to Detroit for a pick. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=587.4s)]
*  Would you, would you dump Levine into Detroit's cap space for the fifth pick? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=592.24s)]
*  I wouldn't do it if I was Detroit. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=597.6s)]
*  I have a better, what would you do with, with Detroit, which we're about to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=602.2s)]
*  talk to in a second, I would see if I can dump Vucevich would be my next one. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=604.88s)]
*  And I just let the Rosen go. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=610.48s)]
*  And I would hope Levine could rehabilitate his value playing with Kobe [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=612.08s)]
*  white and giddy and we're super fun to watch. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=615.08s)]
*  We're up and down. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=618.12s)]
*  We're not that good, but, but we're at least like the ball's moving and we have [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=619.48s)]
*  two guys who can either get to the rim, slash and can't create their own offense, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=624.04s)]
*  create for Levine. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=628.52s)]
*  Um, and I would try to think about trading him in February versus now. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he has any value now. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=633.4799999999999s)]
*  Do you? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=634.64s)]
*  Do you think people are like, Hey, what are you guys doing with Zach Levine? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=636.12s)]
*  I don't think teams, I don't think they're looking at him. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=638.64s)]
*  The contract numbers. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  I was looking at it again today. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  And he said 49 million three years from now. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=648.28s)]
*  With multiple surgeries. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=649.28s)]
*  So I think that's gotta be a wait and see. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  Would you resign to Rosen? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=652.76s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=654.04s)]
*  I mean, and could you get him to resign? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=655.04s)]
*  I guess would be a better question. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=657.28s)]
*  Probably letting him go. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=659.36s)]
*  I'd be open to it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=661.28s)]
*  It depends on what the number is. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=662.04s)]
*  Um, I've got to, I just think that he's, he's a great guy to have around [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=663.88s)]
*  and he's still good. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=671.8s)]
*  And if it's not a tear down. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=674.12s)]
*  LA buzz with him too, by the way, that's another one that would the smoke where I [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=675.52s)]
*  can't tell what the smoke is. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=679.44s)]
*  Cause I was wondering if that was a Paul George destination, maybe. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=680.72s)]
*  Why would you want to go to Chicago? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't think he would, but there's like the Rosen Lakers, the Rosen Clippers [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=686.72s)]
*  and the Rosen coming home. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  I think they saw him at the Kendrick Lamar show and we're like, that's where it all [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=695.44s)]
*  started. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=699.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=699.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=700.48s)]
*  He was out there with Russ. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=701.1600000000001s)]
*  Would you do a sign and trade? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=706.6800000000001s)]
*  The trade machine doesn't work right now because nothing is like legal. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=707.0s)]
*  I know they have to do a thing where they have to, you can uncheck all the, and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=710.64s)]
*  everything is available basically. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=714.44s)]
*  Um, well, I'm on the record. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  If I'm Chicago, I'm just blowing it up. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhkcsSmKXc&t=719.1600000000001s)]
