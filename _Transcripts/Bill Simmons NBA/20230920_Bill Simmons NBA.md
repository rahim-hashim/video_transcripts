# Austin Rivers Thinks Anthony Edwards Has All the Makings of a Superstar | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbjKB2W0f5s)
*  You play with Anthony Edwards. He just, and you've talked about him on your pod.
*  So we're probably have to retry a little of this, but so he has this team USA thing.
*  And he just, he passes all the checkpoints. Now they don't win, but for where he is in his
*  careers 22, the way the USA coaching staff, they just like, they were like, oh my God,
*  like they're just all in love with this guy. Um, he really felt Dwayne weighty to me
*  in that they whatever the 2.0 version, but there was just, it was the first time where
*  I could kind of pigeonhole him in my head was like, Oh, I see what this is now. This is like
*  bigger, stronger way, but you spend time with them, played with them. First question. Um,
*  it seems like he has the Uber competitive side, right?
*  Yes, that's real. He does not like the most. Yeah, that's it. He's a dog.
*  They get everything.
*  Yes. He wants to win. He thinks he's, he thinks he's delusional. He thinks he can
*  beat you and everything. He thinks he can beat me and things he's never even done before. Like
*  we'll talk about like golf or this, this and that. And he'll be like, I'll play. I'll beat you.
*  I'll be, you ever play? He goes, no. I'm like, no, that's not how golf works, bro. Like you gotta
*  really, he's like, man, I'll figure it out. He goes, I win everything I do. That's just like
*  generally in this core. He thinks he can beat everybody and everything. That's just how he is.
*  Yeah. It's like that MJ betting people that his luggage is going to come out first.
*  All that. Yeah. Like he just, it's always something. We used to play, you know,
*  we played cars on the plane and it doesn't play a lot. And then we started getting him to play.
*  And next thing you know, he is like the bully of the table in terms of like getting guys to play.
*  Like we just had a back to back and it's like, I'm trying to get some sleep. He's like, come on AR.
*  And he calls me macaroni Tony. That's my, that's my nickname. I don't even like it, but that's,
*  this is what it is. The whole team calls me and tell me, come on back. We got to play. We got to
*  play cars, man. We got to play. Like that's just, he wants to compete all the time. And D weight is
*  by the way, a perfect, perfect comparison, perfect comparison. Did you ever see fear at any point
*  with him on a basketball court? No, no, he's fearless. He's fearless to even to the point
*  where like sometimes it's too much. Like sometimes he like is so competitive. He'll force something.
*  That's where that was early. That was the early Kobe issue. He wanted it so badly. That's exactly.
*  And that's where he's at right now is that's why this USA was great for him to go play and
*  compete with other players. His growth right now where D Wade really took that jump is when he
*  started dominating on both ends of the floor and learning how to channel his defense to where you
*  pick up the best player at certain times, but still being a defensive, you know, problem throughout
*  the game. And then the fourth quarter, you guard the best player, like learning how to channel your
*  energy without taking away from your offense, competing on both ends. D way did it. D way led
*  this league in blocks. I don't even know how many years for guards, like it has that ability to go
*  do these things and play make. So like that is what's going to take him from being like
*  that second tier star right now. It's like you, if I gotta be honest, if we're going off the past
*  years, like you put book Tatum, that's like top tier guard. You know, he's right under that.
*  I think Ant belongs in that conversation with those guys, but he has to do those other ones,
*  those other, those, those two other points. If he cleans that up, just like Tatum, Tatum defended
*  way better last year, you know what I mean? In the previous series, you know what I mean? So that's
*  something that he has to do and he can do when it wants to, he's unbelievable defense is insane.
*  That was a huge piece for Tatum when he was able to put the two way stuff as like,
*  just really impactful and the rebounding too. That was like, even when I watched team USA,
*  I was like, all right, we can talk about 40 guys, this team needs, but really you could just put
*  Tatum on this team and he would have made a huge difference because he would have had like 12
*  rebounds in every one of those games. The defense was my next question because that was something
*  that jumped out in the team USA stuff where I was like, is this guy like an amazing on-ball
*  defender? And we had no idea. No, he's incredible. When he wants to, he'll just channel it. Sometimes
*  he'll pick a guy and it's usually the best part of the team. Like a star, the star starts cooking.
*  He'll come to the locker, to the huddle and like coach would be talking. He'll be like, no, no,
*  no, no, no, I got it. That's it done. That's it. And he'll like say it out loud, like just,
*  and no one questions it because we've seen him tap into that. When he wants to cut somebody off,
*  that water's off. That's what I'm saying. Like I know that ability is there. I'm not asking you
*  to do it the whole game, pick and choose your points. And I don't need you to be the best,
*  best defender all game, but at crucial moments of the game, yeah, you got to be that. I think he can
*  be both. I think you could average four or five assists. Just stop you being aggressive alone.
*  You should be averaging five assists. And I think he needs to shoot more free throws. I want it.
*  Yeah. Like 12. I want him living at the line, bro. We live in an era where there are no shot
*  blockers, man. You are the most freakish athlete I've ever seen at the two guard spot. You need to
*  live at the basket and I know he could shoot. So there's a healthy diet of both, but like, bro,
*  that motherfucker got to live in the paint and just be a dog. He can really bully that position,
*  especially in his NBA. Yeah. I'm with you because you figure like the checkpoints of being a
*  truly impactful, mattering superstar. And he's been this first one.
*  He's been to 22. Yeah. Yeah. 20. Is he 22? I thought he was 22, right? Yeah. Maybe it's 20.
*  He is. He is. I think he's 22. So then the next jump will be mid twenties when it's like,
*  oh, I didn't realize you were going to be the best guy on a finals team yet, but like basically
*  what happened with Tatum. And then that last step is that 27, 28 age range. That's usually like
*  history of the NBA. That's the final level. Yeah. That's where we're up for Tatum. Yeah.
*  That's when that physical and mental finally kind of come together. And then they have like four or
*  five really good years after that. You know, those like the best years, in my opinion, if you're
*  healthy and take care of your body and good luck and all those other things. And that's where he
*  has to get to. And he's been a hidden gem in Minnesota. Like everyone's talked about it,
*  but him doing this USA thing, you got Kerr and Spoh and like these other guys like, whoa, whoa,
*  whoa. Okay. Yeah, they know now. I knew he was good, but holy shit, this guy is like different
*  than the other guys we got here. You know what I mean? And that's, that's, that's going to be
*  interesting to see over the next years, you know, him in Minnesota, like how long is, you know.
*  Well, that was my final question. Like it is the team around him, the right people you'd want to
*  put around a player like this, where you have two bigger guys. I'm not even sure if Go-Baron Towns
*  can play together. I know you were on the team last year. I'm sure it was, it was noticeably choppy
*  from time to time, but do you even want any big guy with Edwards? Do you want to keep the lane open
*  for him so that he has as much space as possible to create, or does he need a shop locker behind
*  him? I don't know the answer. It was really tough for him last year with two bigs out there on the
*  floor. It'll be interesting to see this year how they do that. I would imagine they're going to
*  start the two bigs and then immediately one of them will come out so they can stagger them,
*  put one of them in the second unit. Cause the floor just has to be more clear for Ant. He
*  couldn't get to the basket. We talked about his free throw attempts or lack of a lot of that has
*  to do with just lack of spacing and lack of shooting. I mean, this guy was dribbling like
*  double teams last year and shooting faderways cause he had to, it just wasn't the most ideal
*  situation. If you go back and watch our Denver playoffs, I mean, he was unbelievable. You know
*  what I mean? Like he just needs a little bit more space. So I don't know how they do that with Carl
*  and Rudy. Carl has to be better at playing the four. You know, he wanted to play the four last
*  year. And then when he did, he'd like go call for the ball in the post and that's not what the four
*  does. So it's just like that adjustment. I think Carl will be a lot better this year. And then yeah,
*  Rudy, I mean, they, they have to figure that out with those two bigs. I mean, that's just the reality
*  of the situation. They still have both of them. You signed Nas Reed back, who's the big, but he's
*  extremely skilled. I love Jayden McDaniels by the way. He's another stud. Jayden is the real deal.
*  So those four, you know, and then Michael Conley is a good, savvy guard, perfect for what they need.
*  You know, they don't need anything else. They already got a lot with Carl and Ant and that
*  whole dynamic there between how many, who gets what shot and this, this and that. So I don't,
*  yeah, yeah, Mike doesn't care at all. No, it's perfect. That's why D-Load didn't work.
*  Does Townes have a bad rap or the right rap?
*  Cat is the nicest kid and guy. I don't like calling him a kid, young man that you could ever meet.
*  He's a sweetheart. People don't like Carl because they feel like he tries very hard
*  to be liked. And if that's the worst thing you can say about someone, then he's not a bad person.
*  You know what I mean? The worst quality of a guy is that he's trying extra hard. So you like them.
*  That just means he wants people to like them. Do you know what I mean? And when you really get down
*  to it, when you hang out with Carl, man, he's like, he's a big kid, bro. He's got a big heart.
*  He's been through a lot of shit people forget over the past couple of years with his family.
*  And he's had to, you know, find out who he is and like this identity that he's trying to find.
*  That's why people make fun of his voice in his interviews and his game style and the way he
*  plays. But like, he's had a lot thrown at him. I still think Carl is trying to like,
*  find this niche of who he is as like a dominating basketball player. Because you can't deny he's
*  good. He is really good. So I do think him and Carl and I told him this, this, you know, this
*  summer, I obviously I'm not back there. I don't think him and Carl work out together enough.
*  It's something that's like a lost art now. Like everyone like you talked about and
*  and in towns. Yeah, people don't do it. You see film all the time of other players working
*  out with other players. Why don't I don't ever see the two best players for teams like locked
*  in the gym. You'll see it here and there. And why aren't y'all working out all summer doing
*  handoffs and picking roles and like fine tuning this like relationship to where like when when
*  November comes like it ain't even a question. I got you, bro. I know what you like. I know where
*  you shoot well. I know it's like, because I've been doing it with you all summer. I've seen what
*  you've made and missed. Like that's just something that doesn't happen, especially when it's like a
*  the two best players are guards. And you see what Jamal Murray and Yoko have going on.
*  Like that shit is so fun to watch because they're so good together. And if Carl and Ant can like
*  tap into that to where they like start trusting and trying to help each other, they'll be both
*  better.
