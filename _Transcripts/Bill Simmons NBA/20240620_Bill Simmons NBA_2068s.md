# Jaylen Brown's Rise, Tatum's Ceiling, and More Celtics Title Thoughts  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYJXA-qaozc)
*  All right, Rob Mahoney and Chris Ryan are here.
*  I have a bunch of things.
*  I was on a plane for six and a half hours yesterday, just writing shit down that I didn't get to cover with my dad.
*  Big picture stuff.
*  I also was taking JetBlue and just watching ESPN for a couple of hours.
*  So watching all their segments.
*  Just scrawling furiously on a napkin.
*  I was like, really? A lot of like, really guys?
*  Just talking out loud.
*  And then, and then I watched the replay of the game, which was also interesting.
*  We need to work on our postgame celebration questions.
*  Oh, for like, court side?
*  Yeah, we peaked with Stu Scott and now it's a lot of like, what does this mean to you, Chris Ryan?
*  How hard was it to win the title?
*  Who are you voting for in November, J.C. Kaden?
*  He must be held to account.
*  We got to really press these guys.
*  But let's start.
*  I have a bunch of questions I wrote down.
*  We'll start here.
*  How did the finals MVP vote become a bigger postgame story than the Celtics winning the title?
*  Going 80 and 21, 46 and 6 at home, and 16 and 3 at the playoffs.
*  It's just the talk culture we have now.
*  What do you think, Rob?
*  I mean, I think some of it is once you go up 3-0 in a series,
*  that's where the attention naturally turns.
*  It would with any team, but especially one like this,
*  where there's kind of open question in the room as to who it should be.
*  It's kind of a perfect storm for it, I think.
*  So it becomes empty, the notebook immediately?
*  A little bit.
*  And you can see it's somewhat the Luka conversation in this series, too,
*  where there's just a natural pivot point in the series where
*  we're trying to figure out how to process this stuff and what the takeaway should be.
*  And once it's pretty clear that the Celtics are going to dominate this thing more or less,
*  we have to go somewhere.
*  I do wonder, though, if it's a trickle-down effect of the fact that we're doing
*  NBA MVP straw polls two weeks into the season,
*  and who's going to win the MVP gets way more attention than somebody,
*  team that's on a 10-game winning streak.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's the nationalization of the NBA,
*  where I think that the assumption is that nobody really cares about how any given team
*  is doing with the exception of, say, the Lakers.
*  Once they know they're going to win the title or whatever.
*  But even over the course of the season, I think that we're way more interested in individual
*  narratives than we are in team success or performance.
*  Well, I think there's something.
*  Baseball is obviously very siloed in that way, where you follow one team,
*  and you see the league through the lens and the prism of your team.
*  The NBA is not quite like that, but even the real league pass junkies are mostly locked in
*  on a pretty narrow window, and they need or want that kind of like,
*  what's my way in to understanding what the season is about?
*  And the MVP conversation is a good way to do it.
*  And I'm watching Wemby to watch Wemby, not to see how the Spurs are doing.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's not like I'm following the team, I am following the player.
*  But I do think that, I mean, for better or for worse, that's where we've arrived.
*  I get it during the season, because like you said,
*  we go player-centric during the season, because teams are too volatile, right?
*  You could be like, oh my God, they won 14 and 15, and then they'll lose five or seven.
*  Yeah, having it with the Cavs.
*  So the player stuff, and is this person top level?
*  I certainly do my share of it on this podcast.
*  It was interesting though, because I was sitting in the seats with my dad,
*  with like four or five minutes left, when it was clear we were probably going to win.
*  And it was one of the breaks, and we just kind of looked at each other and were like,
*  who's the finals MVP going to be?
*  Not that we wanted to know who's going to win,
*  but what the ramifications of the vote would be.
*  And we were like, oh man, I was like,
*  so in the seats, I was like, I hope Tatum wins,
*  because then Jalen will get one and Tatum will get one,
*  and then we're just done with that combo.
*  I also thought Tatum, the way he played in game five,
*  probably like slightly deserved it, because he was so great.
*  And Brad was pretty bad in game four.
*  Brad was bad in game four, and then offensively was terrible in game five,
*  and was good defensively.
*  But anyway, it seemed like it was close.
*  And I think our fear coming out of the game was like, oh man,
*  I hope this doesn't become a story.
*  But then the way they handled the locker room was so smart.
*  It was almost like they had talked about it beforehand.
*  No matter what happens, let's say we did this together.
*  Yes.
*  We're brothers in arms.
*  It was the two of us.
*  And Tatum's posted comments under Brown's Instagram MVP.
*  They just did everything perfectly.
*  They took it off the table as a combo,
*  which weirdly in 2024 you have to do.
*  You do.
*  Or else it becomes a combo.
*  And it would have if they handled it any differently.
*  I think the one side of the celebration being so premeditated
*  is everything you saw from Jason Tatum.
*  A little rehearsed, a little like,
*  I'm going to try to have my big moment here in front of the camera.
*  I think that's kind of his vibe all over.
*  For sure.
*  It's like this weird code.
*  Tatum backlash?
*  No, I'm just saying like I think-
*  No, no.
*  We did it.
*  Are you mad because you traded out of the Tatum?
*  I'm actually a little, you know what?
*  I'm trying to be fucking generous here today.
*  I think he seems like he's like a guy who was like in a lab somewhere
*  being like what is the perfect reaction to each given moment in my basketball career.
*  But the flip side of that is you do get a little more care around these things.
*  You get Jaylen Brown even as he's accepting the award,
*  shouting out Jason Tatum and saying we really did this together.
*  That's I think a show of grace that this kind of moment demands
*  or else it is going to blow up.
*  The way you just described Tatum,
*  yeah.
*  It's funny.
*  I was thinking about this when I was flying back because we would see this.
*  I used to love tennis a lot more than I do now,
*  but you would see this with different tennis chants, right?
*  When certain people would just completely resonate
*  and then other people like kind of resonated, but not totally, right?
*  You had like Martina hinges.
*  Somebody like that or like Lendo was the worst case scenario.
*  But then like when Boris Becker won Wimbledon-
*  People freaked out.
*  Oh my God, Boris Becker.
*  Agassi for forever.
*  But Sampras not so much.
*  Sampras never.
*  Agassi for a while, no.
*  And then later in his career, all of a sudden people are like Agassi.
*  I fucking love that guy.
*  And nobody ever really totally loves Sampras, right?
*  It took Serena years to really win that over.
*  And Tatum to me is almost like getting the tennis player treatment where it's like,
*  I really appreciate that he just run the French Open.
*  He was very good, but I'm not going to be telling my grandkids about this.
*  Do you think that that for the basketball players has something to do with the lack
*  of time they spend in the college game?
*  Because college was where we used to develop our relationships to these guys.
*  And think about how much it colored like how you felt about the Fab Five guys,
*  you know, like or Carmelo or whatever, you know, it was like always like,
*  oh, this guy made a crazy run.
*  Like I was obsessed with Kemba coming into the league because of UConn.
*  So I think that sometimes with Tatum, I know he was a Duke and I honestly
*  can't remember for five seconds a single second of his Duke career or like how well
*  or poorly he did, but he just feels like he's always been this dude on the Celtics
*  waiting for this moment and has rehearsed.
*  He has rehearsed what he was going to say after this.
*  I think the Celtics overall had this vibe too.
*  And the reception has kind of been met in that way where it's obviously impressive.
*  A dominant run.
*  You can't indict anything that they've done here.
*  Like this is a great championship.
*  And yet some championships just respond more with people than others.
*  And some superstars respond more than people with others.
*  And that's okay.
*  Like you don't have to have everything.
*  You have the ring and the trophy and no one can ever take that away from you.
*  I thought it was pretty interesting.
*  You know, I wanted to ask you about this because you look at like the continuum of the,
*  you know, last couple of decades of the game and, you know, we're kind of ending the Lebron era.
*  We're probably exiting the Currierra a little bit, the Durant era.
*  And this championship reminded me a little bit of early 2000 San Antonio.
*  Like a bridge title.
*  Well, it's like clearly the best team.
*  Like clearly the best run team.
*  You know, a group of fan base that obviously appreciates.
*  You'd have them over Detroit.
*  What's that?
*  You'd have them over Detroit as best run franchise.
*  Now, whether it's the most entertaining franchise is a much different conversation.
*  But it kind of reminds me a little bit of that era where it was like,
*  ah, Tim Duncan got another one.
*  How about that?
*  Well, time to get on to baseball.
*  You know, like that was kind of how it was in 2007.
*  Seven Spurs ish.
*  Three.
*  Three Spurs ish.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  After the Kobe Shack dynasty or that run in the beginning of the decade.
*  And then it was like Spurs, Piston Spurs, the Heat won one there.
*  But like, it was kind of like, cool, basketball's neat.
*  You know, and Lebron wasn't here yet.
*  AI was kind of fading.
*  And we were in this post Jordan hangover.
*  And even though Kobe and Shaq were incredible, like, you know,
*  the Lakers were villains to a lot of the NBA and they had their own problems.
*  That's kind of where I feel like we're at now.
*  And the Celtics are very representative of that.
*  I think the one issue they had, which isn't their fault, is just they didn't have like
*  some great games during this playoff run.
*  Probably the most entertaining games they had were the two Indiana Road games,
*  which were great, but messy, messy, but good comeback.
*  For sure.
*  Put some chest hair on themselves.
*  And yet people watch them are like, congratulations.
*  You barely beat Andrew Nemhard, who's by the way, feeling it.
*  You know, so it's not like I look when you end these playoffs, you always think like...
*  There's an asterisk on that because we'll never know what would have happened
*  if Matheran had been playing.
*  It's true.
*  Well, true.
*  Is that Hal Burton thing?
*  But you think about like the NBA TV when they run like the greatest games or like
*  during the summer, it's like August.
*  They're like, oh, we'll run the best games from the playoffs.
*  I don't, for the Celtics, it would probably be game three Dallas,
*  which they almost blew in the second half, right?
*  And those two Indiana games and that's probably it.
*  And I think that like Bellany asked me, like did the finals just came and went?
*  Did anyone care?
*  And it's like part of the reason was that the series sucked.
*  Like the finals wasn't good.
*  Luke didn't really play that well, even though he was terrifying the whole time.
*  Kyrie was awful.
*  Tatum didn't shoot well for the first two games at least, but it was, it just,
*  it's just going to want to be one of those things that come and go.
*  Like, what do you remember from the 03 finals?
*  What do you remember from the 07 finals?
*  And what do you remember from the 15 finals?
*  Sure.
*  But not only like games, even moments.
*  I think there's not even just signature moments or shots.
*  You don't get LeBron blocking it with Ola.
*  There's not like a Draymond dick punch.
*  There's not like a big comeback or anything.
*  And that's fine.
*  And in some ways more impressive, but maybe not more resonant, right?
*  Like running people over in this way.
*  And I think the Spurs comp is a good one.
*  I hadn't really thought about the 07 Spurs in particular,
*  but that kind of machinery of, oh, this is just a superior team rolling over
*  an opponent that's very good, but maybe not entirely up to this kind of competition.
*  Yeah.
*  Makes a lot of sense.
*  And then when you flash forward, you know, the Spurs didn't really get that sort of resonant
*  moment for almost another decade.
*  No, they had to turn into the sort of like beautiful basketball Spurs.
*  Totally.
*  The 14th Spurs.
*  Yeah, that's when they got it.
*  Yeah, the 07 one was funny because that was the whore year,
*  the whorey pushing national in the scorers table.
*  And they won.
*  And I thought the Spurs were the best team that year.
*  And even when you go back and you actually like study that series,
*  like they were going to win that series.
*  I think regardless of what happens, the Suns had a great chance.
*  I still feel like the Spurs were better, but then the years pass and becomes the only one
*  because the whore thing.
*  And then they played Lebron in the finals.
*  07 Lebron, so we had nobody else on that team.
*  And that's just kind of what happens.
*  The more I think about it, this team reminds me of the 15 Warriors.
*  Because like if you ask the Warriors fans,
*  that's a big statement.
*  I can't believe you'd think that.
*  But go ahead.
*  No, but I just, the Warriors, I think statistically like win-loss record,
*  how they did in the playoffs.
*  Very similar point differential.
*  Sure.
*  Young stars that clearly had more stuff on the horizon for them.
*  And then also like they'd never really left you that confident the entire time.
*  They definitely, I mean, it looks shaky against Memphis that year.
*  Yeah.
*  And even in the finals, it was like, oh, well, what would have happened if...
*  So then what's the difference?
*  Is it a lack of charisma on the part of the stars?
*  Like why is the Jays not as big as Splash Brothers?
*  The reason I used the 15 Warriors is because there's all the statistical evidence
*  in 15 that the Warriors were a really great team.
*  Yes.
*  And nobody believed it the entire time.
*  People were like tying themselves in knots.
*  And it was like, yeah, but they shoot so many jump shots.
*  Yeah, but Curry's too young.
*  Yeah, but what happens when they play a big guy?
*  Yeah, but what happens when they do Lebron?
*  And then they won and people were like,
*  oh, yeah, they won.
*  Oh, this is great.
*  And that's what this feels like.
*  But I think with that Warriors team, if you ask Warriors fans now,
*  what's your favorite title?
*  It's 15, right?
*  Or 22.
*  No, I think it's...
*  You think it's the comeback, the 22 ones?
*  I think it's 22.
*  And I think 17 when they just laid the smack down on everybody would probably be the second one.
*  I think over 15.
*  I think 15 is still really a beloved moment.
*  You think?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah, 15 I also think for...
*  22 probably number one though, right?
*  I think the satisfaction of that looping back around is probably...
*  Because that puts him into a whole new stratosphere all time of being able to come back and revive that and win it again.
*  But that 15 team felt like, hey man, what are you doing tonight?
*  Curry's playing.
*  Kind of like we have to go to a bar showing this Warriors game to see this guy play.
*  And the Celtics lacked that player.
*  Well, that team that had the, oh my God, we won.
*  If you're a Warriors fan, they had a one in a million years.
*  That's what the league C change kind of feel.
*  Where this is something different.
*  And I know people are trying to make that argument with the Celtics too.
*  Because it's kind of like the logical extension of all the threes that people have been taking for years.
*  But I don't know.
*  It feels like incremental versus that felt dramatic.
*  Yeah, the Celts end up...
*  They had the second best playoff record of anyone in the 16 win era, which just seems inconceivable.
*  The 07 Warriors were 16 and 1.
*  And then the 23 Denver and 07 San Antonio were 16 and 4.
*  That was another case for that San Antonio team, by the way.
*  They did kind of demolish people.
*  They're also one of eight teams to have a 10 point differential in the season and in the playoffs.
*  And that includes that game where they lost by 38.
*  That had...
*  They just lost that game by six.
*  They would have had one of the great differentials.
*  And yet everybody's like, I don't know.
*  Could they win one more?
*  It just seems like people are more confused than anything.
*  But I think that speaks to more what a weird season it was and how many guys got hurt.
*  Yeah, and a strange postseason.
*  And what you said about this shift of eras that I don't feel like is done yet.
*  Well, think about how ahead of our skis we got probably with Ant.
*  With a bunch of guys that we were like, here we go.
*  It's Shay's time.
*  And it's like, eh, he shot us in the second round.
*  It's like, it's Ant's time.
*  Eh, it seems like you kind of ran out of gas against...
*  But Ant roped us up though.
*  I actually, I don't apologize for any...
*  I don't apologize for any of this.
*  Ant for nine games, it's like he had become Michael Jordan.
*  And it was the most fun I had in the postseason.
*  And then all of a sudden it was over.
*  Yeah.
*  But we kind of lost out on a couple of the...
*  I think we all wanted to see Denver, Boston play against each other.
*  I don't know if the result would have been different or at least more competitive.
*  And I honestly think this thing...
*  We can talk about Luca if you want.
*  This finals kind of deflated the night Luca fouled out.
*  Well, here's who I blame.
*  Number one, just Janis not his fault but getting hurt.
*  Like that Janis, Dane, Bucks versus Celtics just would have been an awesome series.
*  If you blame Embiid next, I'm gonna get mad.
*  I don't blame Embiid.
*  Okay.
*  Jimmy Butler for faking his knee injury because he didn't want to play the Celtics.
*  Wow.
*  What's my camera?
*  Jimmy, we know you faked the injury.
*  No, I'm kidding.
*  Okay.
*  Has he had surgery on that?
*  What happened?
*  No, I think he did.
*  Did he?
*  But just not actually beating Jimmy Butler.
*  And then it was just like this carcass of a heat team that just started shooting threes.
*  And once that ran out, it was over.
*  It wasn't satisfying to beat Caleb Martin?
*  I loved it.
*  You loved it.
*  I think it was actually important for Missoula to just beat Eric Spolster in a series.
*  You need the confidence from it.
*  But those two things and then Denver not showing up.
*  I do think Luca was awesome.
*  I do think Denver is a different animal because that team beat the Celtics twice in the regular season.
*  True.
*  And they were their funny champs.
*  And I just feel like it would have had a different weight.
*  Granted, we were going into the series with people asking if Dallas had the two best players in the series.
*  Which was the night.
*  And by the way, all the Celtic fans kept the receipts.
*  Did you?
*  One of the worst takes of all time.
*  Kyrie was good for four months.
*  Now he's better than Jalen Brown.
*  Like that was insane.
*  Those guys looked incredible for a while.
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  Come on.
*  That was insane.
*  He was incredibly at 16 points a game in the OKC series.
*  We have to build these things up in our heads to be like, here's the argument for watching basketball.
*  Like is it this or that?
*  If I was like Dallas should just be happy to be there.
*  I hope they lose 4-0.
*  It's not going to be a very fun conversation to have.
*  No, but it probably should have been more of a Dallas has the best player in the series and not the two best players in the series.
*  And then Kyrie is the fourth best player in the series would have been the correct take.
*  Really, if you watch basketball for the last eight years.
*  Weren't they saying they have the best backcourt in the series?
*  Of all time.
*  I'm telling you, you can find the takes.
*  Does Dallas have the two best players in the series?
*  And I think there were people that were like, they do.
*  But it was more, and I was doing this before the playoffs and before the finals.
*  Do people understand how good Brown and Tatum are?
*  Because I honestly feel like people just weren't watching.
*  Especially Brown, which I thought was great.
*  Anyway, the Jalen versus Jason thing.
*  One last thing.
*  I was just imagining over the years if we had this for like Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.
*  We had the talk culture we have now in like 1964.
*  And be like, whose team is this?
*  Is this Jerry or Elgin?
*  Is it John Paxson's time now?
*  Callan and Havlicek would have been a good one.
*  Moses and Doc in 83.
*  Moses showed up, but is this still Doc's team?
*  That's coming up next.
*  I mean, the challenge is to be like, George Lynch, could Iverson do it without him?
*  Oh, that's true.
*  What would we do without a no one?
*  Is this Mutombo's team?
*  That's next.
*  Magic and Kareem, I think, would have been the best one though.
*  Because there was always that car keys thing with them.
*  And they, Matt Kareem was clearly the best guy in 80.
*  Even though Magic had the great game six.
*  82 was still Kareem's team.
*  But then mid 80s, it started to flip.
*  And I think people would have just dined on that every day.
*  Well, I think that's also part of what's confusing about the Jays conversation.
*  The question is, these guys are just so...
*  It's basically even.
*  And you're like, well, Tatum seems to have been anointed as this alpha and lead guy.
*  But he obviously can't do it without Brown.
*  But that being said, I don't know if Brown could do it without Tatum.
*  No.
*  I can't believe I'm talking about this.
*  No, no.
*  CR brought up Brown.
*  We just did that Ringer 100.
*  Which I think all three of us voted.
*  Yes.
*  I think the biggest surprise of the season,
*  my dad and I talked about this a little.
*  So I'm repeating it.
*  But just that Jaylen became, for me, unquestionably a top 15 guy.
*  Which is a huge development for him.
*  I think I would not have guessed that.
*  I thought there was a ceiling for where it could go with him.
*  And that offensively he was just not consistent enough.
*  I thought he was a good defender, but not an elite defender.
*  Which I think he became an elite defender this season.
*  Not just in the playoffs.
*  And I mean, some of the stats, like from December through March,
*  which is a four month sample size, he was 24 and six every night, 52%.
*  37% from three.
*  And they, a lot of the times wasn't playing in fourth quarters,
*  like cause they were blowing a lot of these teams out in the playoffs.
*  He was also 24 and six, 52%.
*  Five and a half free throws a game, which was another thing that was super frustrated with him.
*  Where it was just shooting jumpers, not going to the basket.
*  Brian Barrett had a couple of good things.
*  He said from December to the end of the season, Chris is going to kill himself.
*  From December to the end of the season, top 20 in points in the paint.
*  In the playoffs, 12.9 points a game in the paint, which is eight.
*  So he actually changed how he played.
*  And I thought, I thought he was way stronger.
*  Really the last two years, but especially this year.
*  And you could just see on the bench, like he was jacked.
*  And I think him and Tatum, I think we'll get stronger next year.
*  But that was the biggest thing that changed to me is that he just physically became more imposing.
*  So that's what I saw as a Boston fan.
*  You guys don't care about Boston.
*  What'd you say?
*  Let me ask you what the thing I remember went like in my like 10 times a year watching Jalen or
*  whatever in years past is like every once in a while, it just seems like he's just like dribbling
*  off his foot, throwing it to nobody.
*  Like the kind of, there also seems to be a
*  focus and I think probably the focus was like, this is it.
*  Like this is the you guys have been together for X number of years.
*  This is your chance to actually do it.
*  Every turn it was like, there goes Yannis, there goes Joel.
*  Like now no Brunson.
*  Like you, the road is cleared for you guys.
*  And it just seemed like that really focused them.
*  And maybe it's just maturity, but I just, what did you, what did he get rid of?
*  I guess that is the thing that, cause like I watched him and I was like, yeah, he's cool and good.
*  But like he fucks up a lot.
*  Like he, he like makes these mistakes.
*  I think a lot of it is very gradual skill refinement.
*  Like Jalen Brown's a great player development success story in a way that isn't super sexy.
*  Cause he didn't add one definitive thing to his name.
*  He's got better at a lot of it, better at sensing the moment.
*  And the reason he and Tatum work together and what makes them so hard to talk about
*  is that Tatum is the best player mostly because he's slightly more versatile than Jalen Brown is.
*  But he's not like altogether more reliable or more explosive.
*  Like they both have that in them.
*  And I think what Jalen kind of figured out this season is more, when is that spot for you?
*  When is the moment where it's your time to press and not,
*  I'm going to take this offense by the reins and force it upon the moment.
*  I thought he was better just kind of feeling that stuff out, to be honest.
*  Yeah. And that less turnovers, less sloppy, better defensively, just more impactful.
*  Creating some, maybe one more turnover into a fast break, play a game.
*  Um, they figured out something, the five out thing and getting porzingis and getting,
*  getting rid of Rob Williams, getting rid of Marcus Smart, which a lot of people thought about this week.
*  And just having more space, I think really helped those guys.
*  And you can see it in Dallas and game two and game five, where they're just like clear out,
*  these guys are growing one-on-one.
*  They feel like they can get to the rim and they can kick out or they can stop.
*  And I just, whatever balance they had, it was never a hundred percent there until this year.
*  That's what I saw.
*  Well, the spacing in terms of, you know, you brought up Jalen Brown, getting points in the paint,
*  like him unlocking as a cutter comes from that spacing too.
*  The more room you have than all of a sudden, oh,
*  there's so much easy offense for these guys to scoop up.
*  Well, you think like how many forwards, how many wings can do this?
*  Like even like in my top 15, do you consider Giannis a forward or a big man?
*  I consider more of a big.
*  That's how I did too.
*  So if we say Giannis is a big and we say Luca is a guard,
*  that means Tatum's the best forward in the league just by the whatever you consider that position.
*  Luca is a guard now.
*  I'm saying if, well, if we're going to say wing or guard.
*  I think he's a guard, but I feel like you've been beating this drum where he's not really a guard.
*  I feel like he's a wing.
*  I don't know.
*  Is he a wing or a guard?
*  I mean, like he brings the ball up and initiates the offense.
*  He's 260 pounds.
*  Like I don't know what to make of it.
*  I don't know what he is.
*  All right.
*  Regardless, he's not doing defensively what these guys.
*  Let's say a wing creator with size.
*  We'll put Luca first, Tatum second.
*  Ants, ants, I think a guard.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  So now it's KD or Jalen for like the third best forward in the weeks.
*  So is Kawhi's injury record just kind of takes it?
*  And if you go down, like I'm looking at my top 100,
*  after Jalen, you're looking at Palo.
*  You're looking at LeBron.
*  Kawhi, Zion, Butler, Jalen Williams on OKC, Paul George, Laurie Markkinen.
*  Jalen's I think a better bet than all those guys in the forward position.
*  If you're looking for a two-way guy and you want to win basketball games
*  and have somebody who's durable and play the durability thing,
*  which I always talk about, like that matters too with these guys.
*  They don't get hurt.
*  That was one thing that it didn't even occur to me until I think Derek White chipped his tooth.
*  Whereas like aside from KP, it just feels like these guys always get up.
*  Like it is really annoying as a fan of a team.
*  One of the rarest skills though, right?
*  Durability is now like one of the hardest commodities to find.
*  And it may be increasingly valuable.
*  Like if the league is going to have all this parity where you have to be healthy,
*  the time things swing your way.
*  I think what Boston's been able to do over time is give themselves as many cracks at this thing
*  as they possibly can.
*  And that's health.
*  That's also just this team staying together,
*  as by all of us and everyone else trying to kind of tease them apart and pull them apart.
*  It's really their superpower and what allows them to get this far.
*  With the way that they did, they got rid of Marcus Smart and Time Lord to get Drew and to get KP.
*  It's almost like they doubled down on Brown and Tatum.
*  They were like, we don't need to screw with this too much.
*  We need Drew Holliday, who's like the consummate teammate and defender.
*  Well, you do the Drew train every day of the year.
*  Sure.
*  The Marcus trade, I think, was a lot more painful.
*  And we said this last year on the pod over and over again,
*  that trade was more about Tatum and Brown than it was about Marcus Smart.
*  There was a big brother thing with that dude.
*  He really felt like it was the three of them together and they had to get rid of that.
*  And it was a brutal trade.
*  And I'm sure Marcus, if you noticed, nobody heard from him the last two weeks.
*  We haven't heard from him yet, I don't think.
*  Haven't heard of him on a podcast or seen him on First Take.
*  He stayed out of this because I think this is pretty painful.
*  You think he was supposed to have Julius Randall's spot on the halftime show?
*  And they just couldn't make it?
*  Who was the backup plan of Julius?
*  We're looking at Chet Holmgren at that point.
*  I think we go down the agency list on that one.
*  I'm not sure who's next in line.
*  I've already made my case about why I don't think Tatum is a finished product.
*  But I wanted to ask you guys, is Tatum a finished product?
*  Do you mind?
*  I think he's a finished product on the Celtics with this lineup.
*  I don't really know what else he's going to add to his game.
*  And frankly, I think if there was going to be any development, it'd be like non-basketball.
*  It would be like I think personality development.
*  Well, I think that there's something that happens when you win a championship that
*  changes the way you approach the media.
*  Cooking like a chef podcast.
*  Honestly, I'm sure video podcast.
*  Let's see it.
*  Let's see it.
*  Deuce and Jay.
*  Let me see the nice skills.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Woodworking.
*  Teaching my son how to julienne oranges.
*  He gets a new expensive cocktails.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I like that.
*  Make like good scotch drinks.
*  Yeah.
*  He'd be a good muddler.
*  I could see it for him.
*  What do you think?
*  Is he finished product?
*  I think more or less finished product.
*  But I do agree that there is an ease that comes with winning sometimes that unlocks
*  something for these guys.
*  You hope that it doesn't decrease some of the hunger.
*  You hope that there aren't negative trade-offs that come with winning because some guys let
*  their guard down.
*  But ultimately, I think he's more or less this player.
*  I think that player is really good.
*  I think even the Celtics themselves in some ways have been waiting for him to take some
*  next step as a shot creator to hit that next level.
*  That's a really hard thing to do.
*  And if you want to run down the list of the top 100 guys who can actually create individual
*  offense at a higher level than Jason Tatum, it's really not that long a list.
*  He's already really, really good.
*  Why do you need him to have some other level?
*  Because I think there's one more piece to him that we haven't gotten to yet.
*  But do you feel unsatisfied with where he's at?
*  No.
*  I think it's more a case to me of.
*  Is this it?
*  Or is if there's one more level, then that changes the ceiling of what happens the rest
*  of the decade with the Celtics team.
*  Because to me, the level is, I think he can get stronger because he's stronger now, but
*  even I think he could put on like seven, eight pounds and he's just can the way he bully
*  ball Dallas in the fourth quarter.
*  I feel like it's part of the future with him, but figuring out.
*  Eight to 13 feet.
*  And being able to use his strength and speed to get by somebody, but then just take easier
*  shots versus constantly just barreling into people because you're going to get eventually
*  hurt.
*  I mean, very few people watch as much Celtics as you.
*  How much of it is the system that they play versus like what his.
*  Limitations.
*  The handlinitis, which, which, you know, which we're still in.
*  I've talked about forever.
*  Yeah, it's threes or get to the rim.
*  And there's that, that one, like, I mean, the best that it is shade right now.
*  Right.
*  And Luca too.
*  But these guys that, oh, I got a half step on this.
*  Now this is the 10th footer.
*  I'm taking it.
*  And Jaylin's good at it too.
*  And Tatum's just not good in yet.
*  I think he'd be a better three point shooter too.
*  He's not good enough yet as a three point shooter.
*  Well, a lot of them, he thinks he should.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's really tough once he takes really bad three point shots and he's got it.
*  There's an efficiency standpoint.
*  I remember, I mean, LeBron's the best case scenario in this, but LeBron, after he won
*  the first title that next year, he was so awesome coming out of the gates.
*  It just felt like he had unlocked something mentally.
*  And remember he shot 60% for like three months.
*  We were like, oh my God, he went up a level.
*  And then he kept adding stuff year after year.
*  By 2015, he had a post-up game.
*  By 2018, he could just single-handedly overpower whatever lineup somebody had.
*  And that's why I just think it's too early for Tatum.
*  I think, I think there's an, I really do.
*  I think there's another level for him.
*  He just doesn't have the holes in his game that LeBron did and so many other superstars.
*  I think, again, this is what makes him so hard to talk about.
*  He can kind of do everything.
*  So it's not like, oh, go down to the post because he can do that.
*  It's not that he needs to work on his handle in the way that Jalen did because he could
*  already do that.
*  Ultimately, the way you create like offense as a team, is it coming from a superstar like
*  Luca or is it coming from system?
*  And for the Celtics, it's about the system.
*  It is.
*  And that's like that wins you championships in this context.
*  And that's okay.
*  And he doesn't have to be that guy.
*  He doesn't have to be any better than he is.
*  First thing, it's like, yeah, there's some legendary Duncan games and you'd blink your
*  eyes and all of a sudden he'd be at like 24 and 12 in the third quarter.
*  But you don't leave those games being like Tim Duncan fucking killed everybody out there.
*  And I left it that way.
*  I loved him.
*  Yeah, I loved him.
*  Duncan too.
*  One of the 10 best players of all time.
*  And I agree with you that I didn't necessarily have that reaction to a lot of it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm just saying like as a viewer, I wasn't like pouring through the analytics.
*  It was just like, oh man, how did the Duncan wind up with like 22 and 12 already?
*  And then I feel that way about Tatum kind of where it's just like, oh, this guy's got,
*  I thought he was having an off day, but he's got 24.
*  And it just kind of emerges out of the style of basketball that they play.
*  Did they feel like the Celtics, I hate when things go well and then
*  people start talking about what the mindset was.
*  And they definitely spilled the beans on some of this stuff.
*  They want everybody to shoot and be able to switch on D is the platonic idea of the Celtics
*  team. And they basically, after they won the title, they're like, yeah, that's what we're
*  trying to do. We're trying to do this. And I just feel like teams are going to copy that now.
*  How do you copy it?
*  Go find Jalen Brown.
*  Yeah, like it's hard to copy.
*  More and more shooters that come into the league every year.
*  Like if I'm looking at like the Spurs, right?
*  What's the platonic ideal of a Spurs team?
*  And they like somebody like Reed Shepard, right?
*  They have a chance to take it for who's an incredible shooter, but he's six, one and a half.
*  Is that somebody that can switch on D?
*  Is that somebody in the last two rounds of the playoffs with teams just hunt him?
*  Or could he stand up for himself a little bit?
*  Those are conversations you have to have now.
*  If you're the Spurs, do you just want switchable athletes who can shoot?
*  Or do you, are you trying to build like an old school basketball team?
*  I don't know. And maybe the answer is, well, if you have Tatum and Brown, this is how you should play.
*  I just feel like we're six weeks removed from being like, it's all about size.
*  It's height. It's like you have to somebody who's going to take Jokic.
*  You have to have somebody who's going to take Janic.
*  That is going to be the question mark that follows this team around a little bit
*  because they wound up playing a Dallas team that even though they had like the vertical threats
*  with Gafford and Lively, it's not Jokic. It wasn't, you know, like a Janic.
*  I feel like they didn't have to.
*  There was not a clash of styles in this in this series.
*  If you want a reason why the Celtics won this series, it's that they were
*  overwhelmingly more talented than the Mavericks.
*  If you want the secondary reason, it's that Jason Tatum can guard players like Daniel Gafford
*  and guard players like Derek Lively for the most part and get away with it.
*  And so like if you have that guy, everything unlocks for you.
*  If you have a small forward or powerful who's not as good at that stuff as Jason Tatum is,
*  not as good a rebounder as Jason Tatum is, I think you lose a lot of those battles.
*  Also, the crazy thing is I was actually thinking about this when he
*  when he made his pretty valiant return to the floor is I was like,
*  if Porzingis had been healthy this entire series, like this might have been like an all time,
*  wipeout.
*  The Souths had played the whole playoffs.
*  I mean, Porzingis had played the whole playoffs.
*  Probably two of those games flip, would be my guess.
*  Could be.
*  Because he would just have moments where he was the best guy on the floor for like four minutes.
*  Yeah, I mean, even early on in game five, there were times where like you would just see
*  Luca or Kyrie get daylight and then they would see Porzingis and they would literally hit the
*  brakes and turn around and look for somebody else to pass to.
*  Unbelievable job by him to play.
*  I mean, he basically admitted after he really could have gotten hurt.
*  And I think they were really scared to put him out there.
*  But once Dallas did what they did in game four,
*  I mean, that actually was like one of the more like old school pure sports.
*  Like this guy really wants to play in the finals like one more time.
*  Like, because I, you have to imagine like the worst case scenario for that would have been pretty,
*  pretty bad.
*  What a personality rehab by him.
*  I know.
*  This was, if you ask somebody even a year ago,
*  what are your thoughts on Kristaps Porzingis?
*  You'd be like, loser.
*  Good stats, bad team guy.
*  Like that would have been, can't stay on the court.
*  Be a hornet or be a wizard for the rest of his life.
*  Yeah, it was hilarious when he got traded the wizards.
