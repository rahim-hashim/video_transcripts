# Celtics Avoid Disaster in Game 1 Win Over Pacers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70exe_RMkp0)
*  I did not think this was going to be a good basketball game.
*  KOC.
*  I thought this would be the game that Celtics won by 20 points.
*  And then game two would be a game like we got tonight.
*  Instead, we get an awesome game tonight.
*  Is that the Jalen Brown game or is that the, oh my God, I can't believe the Pacers
*  choked that away game, which is it for you?
*  It's the, oh my God, the Pacers choked that away game.
*  I mean, I think for Indiana, this is the game that you had to win.
*  Because I do think Boston's going to have that 20 point victory, probably in game two.
*  I kind of felt the same as you that that would come in game one after
*  rest Pacers just coming out from a hard fought Nick series.
*  And instead we get the game that we did tonight.
*  And I think 157 to go Indiana's up five points.
*  And then you see Tyrese Halliburton, he blocked Star White from behind in that moment.
*  And then he took a hero shot, double step back, hard and style, three pointer,
*  momentum taking him out of bounds, Horford on a switch against him.
*  A really, I thought, you know, careless hero shot.
*  Felt like he wanted the moment instead of making the right play.
*  And that was with 15 seconds left on the shot clock after blocking White.
*  Then he had the turnover after that, dribbling the ball off his knee.
*  And that just kind of, I thought, summarized the blown lead for Indiana down the stretch,
*  the sloppy decisions that carried over into overtime.
*  They should have won this game.
*  The Pacers should have won tonight.
*  So the Halliburton play 58 seconds left after he blocks it, they're up three misses.
*  And still there was two other times they should have won.
*  I mean, first of all, you got to be able to inbound the ball up three.
*  Oh my God.
*  Almost the exact same spot of the Henderson steals the ball in the old garden.
*  Except in this case, it was Siakam tips it out of bounds.
*  Rick Carlisle has no challenges left.
*  But, you know, times have changed, huh?
*  I went to some dark places in that fourth quarter, Cassie.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  There was a weird Tatum sequence and a lot of stuff to talk about with him tonight.
*  But there was a weird Tatum sequence where he just was 40 feet away from the basket for
*  a chunk of the fourth quarter.
*  He had a wide open three in the final minute that was going to give them the lead that
*  I thought was going in.
*  He missed it.
*  And then it was, and you're just sitting there going.
*  Then the rebound at the jumper as well.
*  Yeah. And he misses the, he gets the rebound.
*  He misses a little follow-away and you're watching it going, oh, here we go.
*  Tomorrow is going to be Tatum's not as good as these other great young players.
*  And we're going to have to do this whole thing.
*  Meanwhile, Tatum was really good in overtime and he finally hit a three that I got to admit,
*  I didn't 100% think was going in and that basically put the Celtics up by four and
*  kind of is the game.
*  Was that the three went for whatever reason, the Pacers just left him completely wide open
*  because Andrew Nemhard didn't just switch.
*  Also the, the, and one kind of layup that he hit when he was on, Nemhard was on him.
*  Why did the Pacers have Andrew Nemhard on Jason Tatum with the size strength disparity?
*  I know Niece Smith has followed out of the game at that point, but to me, you got to
*  put C. Ockham on Tatum in that situation down the stretch of that game.
*  Horford.
*  Yeah. I just don't understand it.
*  Tatum finishes with 36, 12 rebounds, four says 12 for 26, 10 for 12 from the free throw line.
*  And really good defense.
*  I thought, and there was some weird strategic stuff with Joe Maz, which I know we'll go
*  into later.
*  But it felt like Tatum should have just been defending C. Ockham at every possible opportunity.
*  And that didn't always seem the case.
*  We spent this long without talking about the Jalen Brown three.
*  My apologies listeners.
*  Sorry, we're, we're a little rattled after, after crazy game, but so they, they, uh, in
*  bounds goes out of bounds, Boston ball Brown on the right corner, double pump, no C. Ockham foul.
*  And by the way, if you're Indiana, it's a miracle that Jalen Brown has the ball with under five
*  seconds left because the odds of him making three straight free throws.
*  If you watch the Celtics for the last seven years, he made two in the fourth quarter, but
*  what would you, what were the odds of him making three free throws to tie the game with the
*  garden crowd completely tense, having a heart attack?
*  I'm going to say like 10%, but C. Ockham for whatever it is, they don't foul and he makes
*  a crazy shot.
*  And the thing is in the fourth quarter, at least Jalen was the one who kind of seemed,
*  if you, if you didn't know anything about the Celtics, you would have thought he was
*  the best player.
*  Right.
*  But that's the great thing about the Jays is it can kind of pass back and forth to then
*  it was Jalen.
*  But biggest shot at Jalen's career.
*  I'm trying to think of a bigger one.
*  I'd say so.
*  I'd say so.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't remember him having a lot of like buzzer beaters or.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, especially when you consider the stakes for this team, 60 plus win team favorites in
*  the East, like they should be in the finals.
*  They've had a fairly easy path so far.
*  They should be there.
*  So I think for, for Jalen Brown, yeah, that was the biggest shot of his career that I
*  can remember off the top of my head.
*  Lifted up, Tate him a little bit and then Tate him.
*  And then Tate him.
*  You know, he finished late because you're right.
*  Like if, if that didn't happen, the conversation would be, would right now be about, well,
*  Tate him struggled throughout the fourth quarter.
*  He really only hit one shot in the fourth.
*  Why aren't they using him better?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, like what can they do differently?
*  And then there would have been another conversation about, are we sure Tyrese Halbert is the
*  best part of the series?
*  You can almost imagine the first take sequence as they have the subjects on the bottom.
*  It would have been like, does Jason Tate need to do more next segment?
*  Is Tyrese Halbert the best part of the series?
*  And we just, we'd hit all the beats.
*  I thought Tate him once again, had an incredible all around game, but the three point shooting,
*  this has been the story now for two years.
*  He's not always lights out from three.
*  It's been the one flaw in his game.
*  And when he missed that three at the top of the chaos, like, oh my God.
*  I mean, we've also watched way too much of this team.
*  And I think for the fans from the outside, probably listening to people who follow this
*  Boston team talking about them, we have to sound like the most entitled fucking assholes
*  in the planet.
*  Right.
*  But we've been watching these guys for seven straight years.
*  And the more you watch anything, the more you see the flaws and the more you see the
*  thing, the glass half empty stuff.
*  They did a lot of good stuff in the OT.
*  I mean, how many points did they end up?
*  They had 16 points in the OT, right?
*  16 to 11.
*  Got a lot of good, and there was, they hadn't scored in the first, first minute.
*  So basically on the last four minutes.
*  But considering they don't have poor Zingas and Al Horford was a guy who was playing what?
*  15, 16, 19 minutes a game for the first five months of the season.
*  And now they're leaning on him to the point that he played 40 tonight, 40 minutes.
*  You know, it's not the whole Celtics team.
*  So if anything goes off, it feels like it's realistic for anybody to come in and beat
*  them.
*  Right.
*  Did you feel like, I didn't feel like this was going to be a sweep.
*  I mean, I thought it was going to go at least six.
*  There was a bet on Fandl.
*  The series will go six or more was plus 120.
*  And I was like, this series would be shocked if it didn't go six.
*  Did you feel like this was going to be a blowout?
*  What did you, what was your like semi prediction for it?
*  I had Pacers losing in five games.
*  So South is winning this one in five.
*  That's why I said Averno won the mismatch on Monday night.
*  And I mean, I started to wonder if that would end up going six or even seven in the middle
*  of tonight's game, but Indiana had to have this one.
*  So I'm not going to move from Indiana losing in five.
*  Well, this happens sometimes with game ones.
*  It's the, we didn't win.
*  And now we basically have to win five of the seven games.
*  Right.
*  This is the sons versus the Spurs in 2008 where that, that crazy get Duncan hits the
*  three and goes into double overtime and the sons, it gets snatched away from them.
*  And then it's just like, not only was that a horrible loss, but now we basically have
*  to win four of the next six when we just won a game.
*  So now it's, it's basically a five, two series, uh, bright side for Indiana though.
*  The pace was really good for them.
*  I thought they, they, especially they were hunting Horford in the fourth quarter and
*  just like whoever just trying to go at him with whoever.
*  And everybody seemed really comfortable.
*  And I think that Nick series toughen them up because there were some moments,
*  especially in the second half, when it felt like, all right, time for you to lose your
*  composure young team that hasn't been in the Eastern finals.
*  And they just kept making plays.
*  I thought see Ockham, uh, there's in the fourth quarter, like, uh, the experience that he
*  has plus Halibur and just being unafraid to the point of a fault, but those two guys
*  seem to lift the team up.
*  And then it just kind of went sideways the last two minutes, unfortunately for them.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, like the C Ockham, Hallibur and two man game, they've been super productive
*  together in the post season together.
*  Like if, if C Ockham screening for Hallibur and they score 1.1, eight points per pick
*  and roll together, according to synergy, they're putting up big numbers.
*  They obviously exploited Boston tonight.
*  See, I can hit in that little shot around the free throw line, attacking mismatches
*  using his size, like the C Ockham versatility.
*  That's why I felt, you know, teams like the Kings, some of these teams out there
*  should have been going at him.
*  Granted, he kind of steered his way to the Pacers.
*  That's where he wanted to go.
*  Oh, you talk about acquiring him in February.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I just think C Ockham was kind of one of those swing players because of how he
*  works next to some of these perimeter creators like Nemhard, like Halliburton.
*  He's just so versatile because he can handle himself and he can screen for you.
*  He can spot up.
*  He had a play, I think like end of the third quarter where he'll kind of strip
*  Jaylen Brown and Brown didn't get back on defense and C Ockham just sprinted past
*  them.
*  He just does all the little things C Ockham does.
*  And I thought that was on display tonight, but ultimately it's like you said, it
*  worked until it didn't.
*  When Indiana turnovers were an issue for them in those runs in the first quarter
*  when Boston went up 12, it was an issue at the middle of the third quarter when
*  Boston built the 13 point lead before they blew that after taking Tatum out of the
*  game.
*  And then it became an issue late fourth quarter and into overtime.
*  So there was really three stretches where the Pacers just got incredibly sloppy.
*  And it was those stretches that I thought completely lost them the game.
*  And Halliburton ultimately, though, I mean, he had a good overall game.
*  I don't want to knock him too much, but like I thought he really choked it away.
*  Last two minutes of regulation and then he wasn't that good with the ball.
*  And yeah, it was so sloppy.
*  Just look at the box score, knowing nothing.
*  And I told you the Pacers had 21 turnovers and then the Pacers were at a 30 to 10
*  free throw attempt disadvantage.
*  You'd be like, oh my God, they lost by 38.
*  Yes, they did.
*  You would have thought it'd be the 20 point blowout in favor of Boston like you
*  thought it would be tonight.
*  Well, part of the problem was they shot the fucking lights out in the first half.
*  What did it?
*  What were they in the first half?
*  I had this written down somewhere.
*  I think they were over 60%.
*  Yeah.
*  And they were just on a heater.
*  Halliburton made two end of the quarter shots.
*  The second one was just absurd, but I was on a Celtics text right.
*  And one of my friends was like, we should be up seven.
*  We're up one.
*  Like this is they just got six free points there.
*  And then they took the lead near the end.
*  And it felt like they were one Halliburton dagger three away from the game being over.
*  The crowd was super tense.
*  I can't wait to, I hope maybe my dad got carried out.
*  I don't know.
*  I didn't know that was a heart attack special.
*  Can you hear from him yet?
*  Got to check in and make sure he texted me.
*  Jesus.
*  The crowd has a weird relationship with this team because when things go a little sideways,
*  there's you feel the tension, not only when you're sitting there,
*  but even you could feel it on the TV.
*  And there's been different kinds of Celtic teams over the years.
*  There's it kind of depends on who your best player is where you can be super confident
*  or you're kind of like walking on eggshells because you know, you don't have as much talent.
*  This team, when things start going sideways, there's just a feeling of like, oh no,
*  oh God, oh, it's going to be one of these games where
*  people can recognize the signs even when there's like seven minutes left in the fourth quarter.
*  Do I sound like an insane person or do you understand what I'm saying?
*  No, because you've seen this story time and time again,
*  whether whatever the iteration of the team was over the years, whether it was the IT Celtics
*  with super young, you know, supporting cast or the Kyrie Celtics, it hasn't made a difference.
*  The Gordon Hayward Celtics hasn't made any difference over the years.
*  It's been a lot of the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think part of it is not having that one guy when everything gets super stagnant
*  that you're just like, I know that guy can get a bucket.
*  Tatum's the closest to it, but you know, if we were, if we were doing playoff,
*  like who do you trust when you're down three with a minute left?
*  You know, it was interesting.
*  Joe Mas went with the white Tatum pick and roll a few times when they really needed a basket,
*  which was the play a lot of people have been crying for basically the whole season.
*  All right, Joe Mas.
*  So Indiana is delighted that the Celtics are not using Tatum as a small ball five, I'm guessing.
*  Like they were leaving game one going, man, they didn't do it yet.
*  Thank God.
*  No percent in this series.
*  And basically just Horford and Cornett as one of those two is the center at all times.
*  The Celtics bench, especially in the second half when they had Hauser out there,
*  looked really flimsy and it's easy to forget.
*  Like, yeah, this Porzingis when he was out there, those are 32 minutes a game that they have to
*  kind of sprinkle elsewhere.
*  So I'll Horford gets some, Cornett gets more.
*  I said this Sunday night, so I don't feel like this is me revising history after game one.
*  I don't understand why they didn't use the Cleveland game to experiment with some small
*  ball lineups and just some stuff, knowing that whether it was Indiana or New York,
*  once Mitchell Robinson went out, there was going to be a small ball lineup.
*  It was either going to be topping at the five or it was going to pressure pressure,
*  should chew at the five.
*  So they didn't use the Cleveland series for that at all.
*  They played out 39 minutes a game, basically down the stretch there.
*  And you get to this Indiana series.
*  Guess what?
*  They kind of need to figure out a small ball lineup.
*  Now we're headed to game two.
*  Is Joe Masjid just this stubborn?
*  What is he doing?
*  So you want to see Tatum on Turner at some point.
*  Right.
*  Or where is, so Berset is just unplayable.
*  Like that one's it.
*  There's no, there's no three guards with the Jays.
*  We can't see that lineup for four minutes.
*  I don't get it, KSC, because I think Indiana felt like there were specific moments that
*  Boston lineups were out there where they were like, here's our chance to make a run right here.
*  Oh, Tatum's out of the game.
*  They're going to play the Cornett Hauser together.
*  And I don't know how they fixed that without kind of dipping into the deeper part of the bench,
*  even if it's Tillman.
*  I don't know if Tillman would have made a bunch of a difference defensively,
*  but the Berset thing, I just don't get, I don't understand why it doesn't play.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is why, like you said, you would have liked to have seen that,
*  you know, in the prior two rounds to see some of that experimentation.
*  Get him some legs.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, the way in which Horford's been attacked over and over and over
*  throughout these playoffs and then in game one against the Pacers, the Celtics have the worst,
*  you know, pick and roll efficiency on defense in the entire league so far in the playoffs.
*  Obviously, much different story in the regular season, but in the postseason, they're 16th
*  in pick and roll efficiency on defense.
*  So I think for Missoula moving forward in the series, I do think it's valuable to have Tatum
*  play the five for short stretch.
*  If Indiana finds other ways to exploit that with Turner,
*  I think personally, if you have Turner posting up instead of pick and pop in
*  at over 40% from three in the playoffs right now, he's been knocked down for two years straight now.
*  I think it's advantageous for Boston if you're kind of force feeding post ups to Miles Turner
*  rather than the pick and pop.
*  So I think it's worth trying.
*  And Horford also could become more effective if he's not asked to play 40 minutes in a game.
*  He's almost 40 years old at this point.
*  If you're playing Horford for 25 minutes instead of, you know, 35 every night,
*  he could be better in those minutes instead of being stretched so thin over the course of time.
*  But ultimately, doesn't it come down to more than anything else?
*  Just the return of Christaps Porzingis.
*  He's the X factor for this team.
*  He's the guy that they need to have any chance in the finals against Minnesota or Dallas.
*  They need Christaps Porzingis because of the offense that he provides with the ability to
*  beat switches, the spacing that he provides as a shooter, the screen and rolling.
*  He's such a versatile offensive threat.
*  And then defensively, all this talk about Horford getting attacked.
*  Well, Porzingis is a very good rim protector, whether he's involved in the action directly
*  or he's the guy helping off ball and causing havoc around the rim.
*  So I think for like, he is the key to everything here.
*  He was ever since he was acquired last summer.
*  And that's still true now.
*  I don't think they need him to get through the Pacers.
*  I think they can win this series keeping him on ice, but they do need him against the Timberwolves
*  or the Mavericks in the finals.
*  If that Jalen Brown shot didn't go in, would you say they need him against the Pacers?
*  I think I might have felt differently about it.
*  I don't know.
*  I still would have picked Boston in the series.
*  I gotta say the teams seem pretty close.
*  Like Jalen got interviewed after the game and he's like,
*  is it he had an interesting quote about Tatum where he talked about the overtime.
*  He said, yeah, Tatum finally got it going.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think he meant it as a dig.
*  It was just, I think he was like saying what we all saw.
*  But then he basically was like, I'm not happy with how we played.
*  I didn't think we played that well, but I test watching the game,
*  but the Pacers from a talent standpoint seemed pretty comfortable against them.
*  I didn't feel like there was a talent to spare at all.
*  I didn't understand the line for the series at all.
*  It was Celtics were nine to one favorites on FanDuel.
*  Even the series going six games was plus money.
*  You look at the line tonight was double digits.
*  And I just didn't really totally understand it because of what you said.
*  There's the KP Celtics, then there's the no KP Celtics and the no KP Celtics have a lot more
*  variance game to game.
*  I talked about Horford before about how he was a 15 to 20 minute game guy.
*  I mean, technically he's not because if you look at his game log, he's in like the 26 range,
*  but that was because they would rest him and play him basically twice a week.
*  Right.
*  And when he played and a lot of times it was when Porzingis wasn't playing.
*  But ultimately, like when they're a playoff team, when KP is back,
*  Horford's probably paying 20 minutes a game max.
*  The fact that they're putting the miles on him that they're putting on him
*  and his shot looks he's three for 12 from three tonight, five for 15.
*  Never good when your big guy is five for 15 field goals.
*  But I wonder as part of Indiana's gameplay and not just tonight, but for the whole series being like,
*  yeah, fucking let out Horford, beat us, knock yourself out out.
*  Because that's what it seemed like tonight.
*  Yeah, I mean, I do think so.
*  I mean, Horford on both ends of the floor seems to be the guy that they're choosing
*  to not worry about as much on offense and then choosing to attack him relentlessly when he's
*  on defense.
*  And it's a pretty good strategy for Indiana, obviously.
*  I mean, like it's he's the guy who's been attacked throughout the postseason
*  throughout for Boston's defense.
*  They have the right kind of team to.
*  For sure.
*  A bunch of different guards that can drive to the rim.
*  Yeah, Halliburton, Nemhard, McConnell.
*  It doesn't really make a difference.
*  All three of those guys have different styles to to attack it in different types of ways
*  and even see Akim for that matter with his versatility as well involved in those actions,
*  whether it says the handler or is the screener.
*  So, I mean, I think ultimately, I mean, your point about it brings it back to your point
*  about using Tatum at the five sometimes.
*  I think it's a tool worth experimenting with for Boston because even if you like he talked
*  about, they should have used it against Cleveland to prep for this series potentially,
*  or if it were against the Knicks, but they also could use it as prep for potentially
*  against, let's say it's Dallas next round.
*  Right.
*  Dallas should get Maxie Kleba back.
*  They do like to go small at times.
*  Boston might want to have that tool at some point, depending on how a certain game is
*  going.
*  I don't think it's something that they should be going to often, but it's a tool you want
*  to have for in the moment that you feel like you need it or if you want to dictate.
*  So I think for the Celtics, it's worth going to at some point in the series.
*  And plus, like you said, Horford playing every other night at this point, giving him a little
*  bit of a breather in these moments, too.
*  Well, he's going to get worse as the playoffs go along.
*  It's just if they're going to because now we're every other night.
*  They put 40 on him tonight.
*  They got to play again on Thursday.
*  Indiana is younger.
*  They're fresher.
*  They're fast.
*  Turner's Turner's playing about as confidently as I can remember from him.
*  I remember it felt like last year for four months, it felt like anybody could go grab
*  him.
*  He was in that Clint Capella gaffer in that range of just centers you could go get if
*  you wanted to take somebody on your cat.
*  But I don't know.
*  I just.
*  I'm still kind of in a dark place, even after a great win.
*  I just don't know if I trust the coach.
*  I'm just going to be honest.
*  I don't I don't know if I trust his ability to read a series or a game ahead of time.
*  And it feels like by game four, they'll be making some of these adjustments.
*  That's the part that really just Carlisle just had this team so figured out
*  hitting the game one.
*  He knew like the three things.
*  I'm going to put Siakam at the foul line when they put their bench out.
*  I'm going to attack this.
*  I'm going to unleash Toppin when he goes in.
*  I'm going to keep trying to hunt Horford, especially in the fourth quarter.
*  He was saving that a little bit, you know, because it was like they're hunting
*  Horford the whole game.
*  They're picking their spots in the fourth quarter.
*  They really started going after him.
*  That's a little data to prepare.
*  Yeah, right.
*  This is the game they should.
*  This is the throwaway game where you just had this crazy seven game series
*  and this emotional win on a Sunday.
*  But yeah, I don't I didn't like at the end of the Celtics were up 92 79
*  middle of the third quarter, like two minutes left in the third quarter,
*  something like that after their big 18 to four run to take a lead.
*  And Tatum was awesome in that stretch, you know, picking on them,
*  great using his size like he was excellent.
*  Like Missoula, even during that stretch at one point, you zone for single possession
*  and just completely mucked up the Pacers offense on that play.
*  But then he pulled Tatum with, you know, 220 or something like that left in the third quarter.
*  And I felt like in that moment, maybe you try to stomp on their throat
*  and extend that lead even more and keep playing through Tatum and slightly move away from your
*  preferred rotations in that stretch.
*  And then Indiana ends up being down only one at the end of the third quarter.
*  It's little stuff like that's annoying with Missoula.
*  Forty six minutes tonight for Tatum.
*  The backcourt on the Celtics drew holiday played 48 minutes was 10 for 16
*  and put up a 28 seven and eight.
*  And I thought it's rare you see at the pro level with a really good point guard,
*  somebody getting harassed into a turnover at midcourt.
*  I think it happened twice in this game.
*  And then, and then that was a really good, really good Jaylen Brown game to 10 for 20.
*  I mean, he had his typical three terrible turnovers that he just can't have a normal turnover.
*  It has to be like one of the five worst turnovers you've ever seen in your life.
*  That's every turnover for him.
*  But I thought he was really good.
*  And if you haven't watched the Celtics a lot this year, people listening,
*  the there's what he did tonight.
*  He was doing all year, like sensing like, oh, Tatum doesn't have it for this quarter.
*  Oh, we're in a little bit of a funk.
*  I think I can take this over.
*  And sometimes, you know, he tries to outkick his own coverage, but a lot of times he makes
*  big plays, gets big rebounds.
*  So is around the basket.
*  I thought the Celtics seemed a little more physical down the stretch around the rim.
*  I didn't, I don't really have an explanation for why the,
*  the free throws were like 24 to three at one point.
*  Pacers had three free throw attempts in the fourth quarter.
*  Just watching it, not caring, you know, whatever.
*  Like, did you feel like it was slanted or why weren't the Pacers getting calls?
*  Well, tonight in the game, just to throw the stats out there behind it,
*  the Celtics attempted 28% of their shots at the rim.
*  The Pacers attempted 27% of their shots at the rim.
*  So it's not as if Indiana wasn't getting an equal amount of shots at the rim as Boston.
*  I did feel like the officiating was slanted in Boston's way, but Indiana also in the half
*  court doesn't get to the rim as much as Boston does.
*  You know, Boston still isn't a lot either, but a lot of those at-rim chances for the
*  Pacers were in transition after getting stops on defense.
*  And so I think that's part of it.
*  We'll play it into it.
*  I have to rewatch all the plays, all the finishes at the rim and all the drawn files.
*  But I think it was slightly favored in Boston's way, but not like anything super significant
*  that I'd be, you know, furious right now if I were a Pacers fan.
*  Rick Harrelyer said after the game, this loss is totally on me.
*  With 10 seconds left, we should have called time out and advanced the ball.
*  Wow.
*  I guess he has to say that.
*  He wasn't going to be like, this loss is on Tyrese Howe Burton.
*  I don't know why he lost the ball.
*  Why'd you dribble the ball off your knee?
*  To give them three.
*  I will say though, I know that wasn't an awesome, Albert and like crunch time,
*  but the fearlessness he has and the joy that he plays with is really fun to watch.
*  And I'm glad that, you know, there was a moment during that Knicks series in game five where
*  it was like, man, what is this?
*  Like what?
*  Eight shots, nine shots or something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just like you're doing like the poor man's car on my own routine, but I thought he rallied
*  back. He was awesome against a depleted Knicks team game seven.
*  And then he had some good, I mean, the thing about if you're going to beat a team that's
*  better than you, we think Boston's better.
*  You got to be unafraid.
*  You got to be unafraid to game like this.
*  This team was unafraid.
*  I didn't, knee Smith was another one.
*  I thought knee Smith was excellent and really was unafraid of either Brown or Tatum.
*  It just was like trying, you know, you knew he was going to foul out if the game went
*  in overtime.
*  Former teammates for him as well.
*  Oh, a little revenge game.
*  Yeah. I mean, I think Zach low email, he texted me today actually, we're about, we were just
*  bragging about our knee Smith Island, like those, those little shacks we bought on new
*  Smith Island four years ago.
*  Now it's like, you know, the islands up way.
*  Yeah.
*  We listen, there's been some losing Romeo Langford Island.
*  I finally had to just kind of throw that in the garbage.
*  But, but he spent, did you like these smithers on the Celtics?
*  I liked them more in the draft than when he was actually on the Celtics.
*  He was just okay with Boston.
*  He didn't come along.
*  I just threw him in the corner and told him not to do anything.
*  Basically Indiana, you know, he's still a three indie guy.
*  It's just, he's figured it out.
*  He's figured out the shot.
*  He's got a role on defense and you're right.
*  Like he plays with no fear.
*  And I think that's kind of true for this entire Indiana team.
*  The one thing I will say about Halliburton, I know he had a good game overall, 25 points,
*  eight of 18.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes I just feel like he hunts threes too much.
*  Like, I, like he is such a good mid range shooter.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a knockdown mid range shooter.
*  There's just certain times I, in that overtime and the end three pointers,
*  I've mentioned a couple of times at the end of regulation where I'm like,
*  you don't need to rush it all the time.
*  You don't need to always hunt that three pointer.
*  You don't need to be James Harden.
*  Learn from his mistakes in the past and sometimes look for the easy mid range shot.
*  Like Nemhard had that like baseline jumper, right?
*  Like in mid range, like see how to pull up, like
*  Halliburton's over 50% guy for mid range.
*  He just doesn't take it that often.
*  And I wish there's times where you take 14 out of your 18 shots from beyond the arc.
*  I'd like to see him use the mid range more often.
*  I think he'd be able to get more shots per game as well.
*  If he looked for the mid range, instead of just being all threes,
*  all layups all the time and then playmaking, he's tremendous.
*  But I think the madding, the mid range is the next element for him to really become a,
*  you know, top 10 level player and not just one of the 20, 25 best guys.
*  Was very similar to the Tatum conversation, right?
*  When that we were having like a year or two years ago about
*  was she, why won't he shoot foul line jumpers?
*  Why won't he dip into his bag a little bit more?
*  Why is he so happy doing these step back threes?
*  Drake May was at the game tonight, I guess.
*  Yeah, looks sharp.
*  Great to see him.
*  David Ortiz, Big Poppy was at the game.
*  I do feel like when Big Poppy's at the game, I feel like good things are going to happen.
*  I mean, that guy literally changed the course of Red Sox history
*  and maybe even my life to some small degree.
*  And you just feel like, oh, Ortiz is here.
*  Like he's single handedly won the 2013 World Series.
*  I feel good about this.
*  He just puts a big smile on my face anytime I see him.
*  It's crazy.
*  It'll never go away.
*  He'd be 80.
*  I'm like, oh, Ortiz is here.
*  So you thought Celtics in five.
*  What do you think now?
*  Celtics in five.
*  I'll stick to it.
*  You're still sticking to Celtics in six?
*  This was, I thought the Pacers were going to win game two and game four,
*  and it was going to be two, two after four games.
*  And then the Celtics were just going to blow them out and game.
*  We'd be one of those series, but we had to get super tense about it in game four.
*  Oh my God, Celtics is going to blow this.
*  For them to lose this, for the Celtics to even have this go to seven now after,
*  uh, after stealing this, right.
*  And then game twos, two nights from now, I do have that thing that worries me is
*  the miles on Horford and the fact that there's really no alternative because the
*  Cornet, you know, he's up and down to McGuinneth.
*  Tillman, that's what they got him for.
*  He's up and down to McGuinneth.
*  He's that versatile switchable guy.
*  They just don't use him.
*  Joe, you know, this is like a Celtics coach.
*  I'm going way back, but the 88 Celtics, were you born in 88 yet?
*  I was born in 90.
*  Casey Jones just let Reggie Lewis just rot on the bench for the entire playoffs.
*  And there was no internet for me to complain about this.
*  I had no outlets really at all, except for my dad and for a couple of people at like
*  Dunkin Donuts and, uh, he just wouldn't play them.
*  And I really think, I really think if he had played them, I think they could have
*  potentially beaten the Pistons.
*  Um, I don't know if we'll feel this way about the Celtics this round, but it is
*  frustrating to be like, dude, you had the whole season, you won 64 games.
*  You won the conference by 12 games.
*  Like, why didn't you see a little bit more of what you have with some of these guys?
*  So you're prepared for every situation.
*  Once we get to the playoffs.
