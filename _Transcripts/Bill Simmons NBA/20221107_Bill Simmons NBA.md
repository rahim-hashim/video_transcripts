# Should the Lakers Move on from Anthony Davis? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meU8KxVGV1o)
*  Do you feel like Davis is actually on the table is my first question.
*  And if he is, is he worth less than maybe people realize?
*  I think he should be on the table, whether he is or not.
*  I think that would largely be dependent on your second question.
*  What's the return here?
*  We saw Rudy go bear go for four first round draft picks, a swap, and then
*  Walker Kessler, who was just drafted in the first round.
*  So effectively five first rounders in a swap.
*  If that's Vanderbilt Vanderbilt to another young, you know, high quality player.
*  So if that's the return for the Lakers, if they're willing to go a picks
*  based package with a little bit of talent and return, which clearly Utah's
*  gotten, they just keep winning again today against the Clippers in that case.
*  Then maybe it does make some sense to reset around LeBron James, head into
*  the off season with potentially a bunch of cap space and more than just the
*  three first round draft picks.
*  Cause if they go into the summer as is, they'd have their 23, the swap from the
*  Pelicans, 27 and 29 with the cap space to make some moves, some signings and what's
*  a, you know, average, you know, below average free agent class that is probably
*  not going to be enough for them even to get on par with the rest of the West.
*  So that comes back to Davis where like, you're right, Bill, he's not the same guy
*  we saw in the bubble, but I do think it's worth giving him credit for the defense.
*  He's played this year.
*  He's still been a great defensive player, so they're still valuable for some other
*  teams that I want to get.
*  I'd say great.
*  He's had some great stretches.
*  He had a moment.
*  Do you think he's all defense?
*  Great.
*  Potentially.
*  Yes.
*  He had a moment against the Pelicans the other night where he switched on a
*  CJ McCollum on the left wing, corralled him, and then he switched down back
*  inside block Jonas Valentine Tunis from behind, then he sprinted up the floor
*  for a transition lob dunk from Russ.
*  So, I mean, like he's defending CJ, I won't play Jonas on the next play.
*  He's playing at a high level on defense.
*  It's just the offense has declined so much for him, not shooting the ball well,
*  as we know, and out of isolation's a question for you, Bill, over the past four
*  seasons, his four years with the Lakers of the 50 players that have isolated the
*  most, where do you think 80 ranks and scoring efficiency of those 50 players?
*  The 50 players with the most isolation.
*  Yes.
*  I definitely think it's low because it's noticeable when you watch them
*  that it's not a good play.
*  So I would say he'd be in the bottom 20% would be my prediction.
*  48 out of 50 in isolation scoring efficiency, according to the second
*  spectrum, Julius Randall's 49th and Russell Westbrook has 50th.
*  That's over the last four seasons on post-ups Davis is 16th out of the
*  top 25 and post-scoring efficiency.
*  So out of these self-creation plays, ISOs, post-ups, he's not getting it done.
*  And because they don't have a lot of spacing, they're not able to
*  effectively run, pick and roll.
*  Everything he does comes off cuts when he can roll floaters, you know, at
*  rim finishes off a cuts offensive boards.
*  So there's definitely a logic to trading them.
*  It's just a matter of what are your priorities?
*  If you're the Lakers or your intentions to trade him and then try to recalibrate
*  around LeBron James over the next two to three years, are you willing to risk him
*  saying, you know what, screw this trade me?
*  Are you willing to risk that just coming off season by trading Anthony Davis?
*  His fellow club clients.
*  So that, so next year it'll be like the last one where they have him under
*  control with the contract, right?
*  And if he's unhappy heading into the summer, that could happen.
*  I go, go to this Cleveland game today and look at the actual numbers half by half.
*  Do you know how many shots he took in the second half?
*  This was a close game.
*  No, we only had two points to two games in a row.
*  He was one for two field goals in the second half, and he took no field
*  goal attempts in the fourth quarter.
*  The reason this is interesting to me is they're playing Cleveland who I think is
*  going to be one of the tougher matchups in the league for him, right?
*  Cause they have Moby and Allen, that they have size.
*  Um, and it's just going to be tough for him to create his own stuff.
*  And the Lakers didn't even go to him.
*  And I wonder like, you know, I I've seen all the offensive stats and how, how
*  kind of dangerous they are with them.
*  I do think he's point guard dependent a little bit more than maybe we realized.
*  You know, like you think back to that, like the best he looked at New Orleans,
*  right?
*  It was that one year with Rondo and he was above the rim and, and just playing
*  off Rondo and all these different ways.
*  Who is he playing off now with this, with this Lakers team, even, even when, uh,
*  during the bubble season, like Rondo was on that team, they had Caruso, they
*  have guys who knew how to move the ball from the right kind of pass.
*  I just think this is the wrong team for him.
*  And I think there's a lot of different things going on with this Lakers season.
*  None of them are good, but this isn't a good team for him playing with Lonnie
*  Walker and you know, whatever Westbrook minutes overlap with him, who is the
*  guy in this team who's going to make him better?
*  And it is it supposed to be LeBron?
*  That's LeBron's role.
*  Is it Schroeder?
*  Is that what they're reliant on here?
*  Once he returns?
*  Schroeder is another like shoot first point guard though.
*  Right.
*  He's not like a distributor necessarily.
*  I just, it's a combo of Davis never seems like he's in the most incredible shape.
*  I think that's been an issue the last couple of years all over the map.
*  Asked him to add weight too.
*  I wonder if that's part of some of that.
*  He just doesn't have the, you watched his old video of him with the Pelicans.
*  He was so fluid.
*  People called him a wing or a guard with big size.
*  So I mean, he did have a lot of skill and fluidity then that's kind of been
*  lost with all the weight he's added in order to play the five more often.
*  Right.
*  And you think like four or five years ago, he wasn't like freak level.
*  He wasn't like Yanis level, but definitely was in that unicorn.
*  Oh my God.
*  This guy in person is crazy.
*  How athletic he is, the long arms, all that stuff.
*  Doesn't seem as special to me anymore.
*  Athletically.
*  And he's going to be 30 in March.
*  Scott's a miles.
*  He's had a lot of injuries.
*  The most interesting thing to me is I went through this exercise because you
*  mentioned that go bear trade and I think you're, you're the highest on go bear.
*  Probably.
*  I don't know if you're starting to cool off on that a tiny bit.
*  Little cool off.
*  Tiny bit.
*  No, not, not, not on our Rudy, but I think the situation I've definitely
*  cooled over all the mix with.
*  You don't like the town.
*  Edwards, go there with his hands on his side at a play call.
*  And just kind of only there.
*  I think they probably paid 170 to 200 cents on the dollar for go bear.
*  I don't think that's a realistic starting point for Davis.
*  And I went through the teams trying to figure out like, who would be like, Oh,
*  cool, Anthony Davis might be available.
*  I think there's some real red flags now.
*  I don't think this is a situation like it was in 2019 when it's like Davis is
*  available, Oh my God, got to get Davis.
*  Like throwing every asset.
*  This guy could be, you know, Kareem Shaq Davis.
*  Those days might've sailed, but he's still a really good player.
*  And I think he could be impactful defensively.
*  And if you put him on the right team, I think some of this stuff that
*  made him great could come back.
