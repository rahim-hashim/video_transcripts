# Why Evan Mobley Deserves the DPOY | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHDTM0zkFg4)
*  defensive player of the year.
*  I think the hardest ever.
*  Impossible.
*  Jaren Jackson is favored
*  and just completely violates
*  I don't know a rule that I
*  value like did you play enough?
*  He didn't even get to
*  1800 minutes.
*  And I get that he was super impactful
*  in those 1800 minutes but
*  man I think
*  we're really cutting it close and there was
*  two examples in the past.
*  One was like within the last five years of
*  Go Bear. One I think in
*  2018 and had to around the same games
*  at minutes.
*  I remember specifically not voting for Go Bear that year
*  but
*  I can't get there
*  with Triple J. I'm not going to vote for him.
*  So I'll start
*  there. Are you voting for Triple J
*  as your defensive player of the year?
*  The block rate is
*  so insane
*  that I was like wait
*  is this what I'm doing? Defensive player
*  of the year in the defensive first and second teams
*  other than MVP were the
*  hardest things and in a way it was
*  even harder. Yeah.
*  And that's the thing with the ballots you kind of have to just
*  finally get to a point with it where you go
*  hey it's not perfect man
*  it's not perfect. There's not going to be a perfect
*  ballot this year. So
*  I went with Mobley.
*  Wow.
*  I can't tell you how excited I am
*  because I also
*  went with Mobley. No you didn't.
*  I had him and Dreymond Green.
*  I swear to God
*  I had him and Dreymond
*  as my final two. I ruled out
*  Brooke Lopez because
*  I get it. The stats are amazing.
*  The eye test he was awesome.
*  But he's the third best defensive player
*  in his team. I can't get past that.
*  He is not a better defensive player than Drew Halliday
*  and Giannis and part of what made him so great
*  and I'm admitting that he was great
*  for what he was supposed to do.
*  He got to play with Drew Halliday
*  and Giannis and that allows you to just
*  worry about certain things and be really
*  good at them.
*  I couldn't get there with him and the triple J
*  thing just for people listening.
*  63 games. 28.4
*  minutes a game.
*  Did not get to 1800 minutes.
*  Mobley played 930
*  more minutes than him.
*  Eye test. Well you make the case and I'll
*  see if you missed anything. I'll chime in.
*  Alright so I kind of went into every award with
*  my eye test position and then
*  I would check the numbers and I would either have
*  the numbers go like wait a minute you might be doing
*  this wrong or the eye test would fight
*  back and be like what's the fucking point of sitting in your
*  couch for the last six months
*  if you're just going to start sorting all this stuff out.
*  There were moments with Mobley where I felt
*  like he could do anything he wanted to
*  defensively. The only time that it looked bad
*  was against Embiid because physically it just wasn't
*  going to happen. You could also if you're a Bucs fan
*  encounter with like well wait a minute
*  he's also got Jared Allen back there.
*  But what I love about Mobley
*  and this is kind of back to your Garnett thing
*  is that it looks like when he switches
*  onto smaller players he's
*  not giving anything up.
*  And as great as Lopez's
*  stats were there's a rim differential
*  where Giannis like the
*  the field goal percentage went down by like
*  17 percentage points.
*  I don't know if I have that exactly right but I
*  just know where he was. It was beyond everybody else.
*  So I'm like yeah you have Giannis as the low man
*  helper on anything that Brook is doing
*  while he's also in drop coverage while
*  Drew is also ruining pick and rolls
*  if he wants to or shutting down a guy
*  off the ball if it's a wing.
*  And so it may seem unfair
*  to Brook when you look at the full contest
*  numbers like the full contested shot
*  numbers for Brook Lopez are fucking crazy.
*  Like he's 17 and a half
*  contests a game.
*  I saw that.
*  It's like five more
*  than everybody else. But it's 16
*  as two pointers.
*  So if you're going to
*  argue hey
*  Brook is this and Brook is all these different things
*  I'm not actually going to tell you they're wrong.
*  I think it kind of circled back to like the moments
*  where I felt like Mobley
*  blocked the big guy that was driving
*  at him. Mobley switched onto
*  a smaller guard and shut him off.
*  Mobley came over to help at the rim
*  leaving his guy with these amazing instincts
*  in blocking the basketball.
*  I know there's some metrics that favor Mobley too.
*  That wasn't it. It was just all the nights
*  of watching this guy going like holy shit
*  and rewinding it going did he just do that?
*  And yeah I feel like with
*  the defensive stuff I kind of went back to eye test
*  a little bit more because a lot of the defensive numbers
*  although like a good foundation for it
*  I wouldn't want that making my decision
*  because I know that can be a little fucked up too.
*  Cleveland had the best
*  defense in the league.
*  That matters. The counter
*  argument for Jared Jackson is when he came
*  back from his injury they became the best defense
*  in the league but well he missed those games.
*  We wrote a big feature
*  about Mobley. Jared
*  Allen said to
*  the ringer quote
*  his help side defense it's not said
*  enough how much that helps our well it really
*  is our defense.
*  And I think that's the key point because
*  they have Mitchell and Garland as their guards
*  and Allen
*  as the rim protector but what they really need
*  in any switch or whatever they somebody
*  who can just guard anybody right and any sort
*  of switch pick and roll and that was the thing
*  that over and over again like there's some good stats
*  with Mobley. He was first in
*  contested three pointers per game 3.6
*  He was
*  third in most contested shots
*  11.5 trail just Lopez
*  and Nick Claxton. He was first
*  in defensive wood shares. He was
*  fifth in switching when defending screens
*  and pick and rolls. He was ninth in guarding
*  isolations. He was top 20
*  field goal percentage at the rim.
*  He played big minutes.
*  He played 35 minutes a game. He played
*  2700 like
*  15 minutes for the season. He didn't
*  he was in the lineup all year.
*  And I just thought he was the most important
*  defensive player. Jared Jackson had played
*  10 more games fine.
*  The way to pick apart the Mobley case is
*  the per possession
*  on off there's some on off stuff and you can
*  get you can
*  nick them for
*  but he kind of had to play backup center for them
*  which I don't think he's big enough to do. And if you
*  look at the lineups where he
*  got to play with Allen
*  the stats are
*  really good. And yeah they dropped
*  when he had to be the center on these smaller
*  lineups but they probably should have
*  kind of held the fort. I don't know I thought
*  I thought he was the most important guy
*  that I saw this year and that was the top five
*  team. My other guy was
*  Draymond and I looked at it.
*  I looked at it because Draymond is the other
*  eye test one especially when you look at who's on that
*  Golden State team.
*  The fact that they finished what
*  five six games over 500
*  and he's really the only
*  elite you know
*  defensive guy they had other than Wiggins who only
*  played 37 games.
*  So that was the other one I was thinking and I really
*  battled back and forth but I
*  just feel like the Warriors like they just weren't good
*  enough defensively to be like oh they had the defensive
*  player of the year and I just couldn't get there.
*  He's won before so
*  Moby I don't feel great about it but I think
*  it's the right pick.
*  It seems like you do too.
*  Yeah wouldn't scream about it.
*  No I could be wrong.
*  But I went with Jackson
*  second not just
*  because the block rate but
*  you know some of these awards where you
*  got to go head to head with the other guy
*  that could be when
*  you know the minutes can be a tiebreaker
*  but you know I don't know who could ever
*  do this where you're like hey this is consistently
*  my standard every single time.
*  I think when it's MVP the
*  minutes thing should matter when it's all NBA
*  you got to get a little looser with your rules
*  for it and for a defensive player of the year
*  and the times where I'd watch Moby
*  going and not like I'm not watching Jared Jackson
*  do stuff where I'm like what the fuck did he just do
*  that's crazy.
*  And then maybe I don't know I mean maybe it's a throwaway
*  here but I put Drew third just because
*  I felt like when Drew had to kind of ruin
*  what you were doing at the point of attack he did it
*  better than anybody else in the NBA this year even though
*  Caruso deserves to be mentioned.
*  He'll be all NBA
*  defensive I think maybe first team for
*  me. I know OG and an OB
*  you know we start talking about some
*  of the other wings but I had a really hard time
*  whittling this there were so many awesome candidates
*  for it but I was kind of surprised
*  towards
*  the end I was like you know I don't
*  I don't know I don't know if I'm getting
*  it right with the brook pick because of
*  the other two teammates and the system.
*  So that's what I did.
*  Cleveland gave up 106.9
*  points a game which was three points
*  better than everybody else in the league.
*  Golden State gave up 117.3
*  points a game which was
*  22nd out of 30.
*  And that was ultimately why I went with Mowby.
*  I had Drew third as well but I
*  didn't have I had
*  Draymond second. I didn't have
*  I didn't have Jaren Jackson in my top three.
*  As good as he was
*  I just think
*  the minutes thing matters.
*  You know it's not just that he
*  missed a bunch of games but that he
*  doesn't play a ton of minutes when he
*  plays and I think that
*  when you know you're only going to play 28 minutes
*  I think you can play a little bit
*  differently. Like now that Adams is
*  out now that you see him with a bigger
*  minute load I think it's hard to challenge
*  every single shot to be
*  like oh you know
*  it doesn't matter if I get five fouls
*  we're deep. They're not deep anymore and
*  I don't think he's going to be able to play the same way.
*  I thought he was awesome though. I mean he definitely
*  he's way up there. I don't think there was
*  a completely right choice.
*  So I'm with you.
