# Is Shai the Best Bet for MVP Right Now? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-85l1Mr6UJQ)
*  As you know, I'm not allowed to bet MVP.
*  I did notice. I'm gonna predict in my head who I liked. Don't say Tatum 18-1. Stop with that.
*  Celtics look great. Celtics 14-0 at home.
*  That's what it is, right? Yeah. Yeah, pretty good. All right. I gotta say I was impressed. They had the back-to-back against Cleveland,
*  and then the back-to-back against Orlando at home all in the same week.
*  And it's like, all right, which one are they gonna play the shit game in and lose, right?
*  There's no way they're gonna play well in all four of these.
*  Didn't happen. They won all four of them. It was impressive. They wouldn't have done that. Last year they were with the Bullman.
*  So Halliburton 20-1. That's what you're saying.
*  Ooh.
*  Well, you told me Devin Booker a couple weeks ago. You still like that? I just like the odds.
*  It was 26-1, but no, the Suns look like... I'm a little worried about them. All right. I give up.
*  SGA 10-1.
*  Ooh.
*  So here's the case.
*  Well, he did it again last night. He had the...
*  I don't know if you saw it, but Denver's up one.
*  They run the worst play ever for, you know, this trend where these teams try to kill the clock.
*  Like 35 seconds left. That's like, let's burn as much clock as possible and then get a terrible three with two seconds left.
*  And SGA, they don't call timeout.
*  And he comes down and just nails a shot. But so OKC right now, they're 16 and 8.
*  They're second in the West.
*  They're plus 6.8 in a point differential.
*  And I think they're going to be a top three team if they don't do anything.
*  But they have all the shit to trade.
*  And the combo of like, I think you have to be a top two seed to be an MVP.
*  I think you have to be one of the best five players in the league and one of the most valuable guys in your league.
*  And you also have to be having a really good season. He's averaging almost 31 points a game.
*  Like he's a first team all-in-B.A. guy by any calculation.
*  And if they make a trade and end up being like a 55 or 53 win team, something like that,
*  I just think his odds should be better. So I was surprised because right now it's Jokic's plus 210,
*  Luka's plus 430. And by the way, you compare Shea to Luka,
*  Okay, so his team is doing better and his stats are just as good and his end of the game stats.
*  He's probably one of the best end of the game guys in the league. And Bita's plus 430.
*  Janos is plus 850. Shea is 10 to 1. Tatum's 18 to 1.
*  But to me Shea should be second in odds right now. I think it should be Jokic and Shea.
*  All right, let me tell you why I like this and why I hate it.
*  Okay. I like it because I think it's important in these things for a guy
*  you're suggesting to get votes. I feel like votes are important in these things.
*  So like people scream about McCaffrey. I'm like, that's not a good bet. Running backs don't get votes ever.
*  Right.
*  Stop it. I don't care what you're seeing on your TV.
*  SGA was fifth in votes last year.
*  Right.
*  So he gets, you know, he's got some, I don't think you voted for him and that's what I hate about him.
*  I voted for him fourth, I think for MVP last year.
*  All right. So he gets votes. So he's in that group, the select few that get votes. What I hate is
*  you typically give me like four guys to bet on for MVP and I just think it's like you and Dr. J.
*  It's a practical joke on me. You're just laughing. You're just laughing. Or you in house or something.
*  Every time I do this, it's always about the value of the odds in the moment.
*  And like when Booker was 26 to 1, it was just, those are pretty good odds because it seemed like
*  Phoenix had a chance to be really good. And the more we watch them, I think Phoenix has a lot of
*  flaws. I don't think they have any chance to be in the top three team.
*  So he averaged 31 last year though. You know that, right? I mean, I know you know that.
*  Yeah, but their team is way better. And I think if the team, they're 40 and 42 last year and he was
*  number five MVP this year, 16 and eight. And I think the thing, they're also, I think the highest
*  scoring team in the league or their highest scoring team in the West. But what I like is the trade
*  possibility because they have expiring contracts. They have all these picks. Like they might go get
*  lower marketing. Right. You know, they could get, I don't know, like pick anybody to put in there.
*  And you know, what if they got, even if they got like Terry Roger from OKC, they're going to get
*  one more guy and they're going to get one more big guy. So, and then, so what seed will they end up
*  with for him to, how high, where do they have to get? So this was my big prediction this year was I
*  thought they were a 50 win team because of their youth and because they had a good guy and they had
*  stuff to trade. I think they are unquestionably a top three seed because the thing with young teams
*  is they're, they're just healthier and there's less variance with them. They're just good every game
*  because they're not, it's not like the Clippers where you're like, I don't know if James Harden
*  is going to show up tonight because he's 34 years old. So with them, like 16 and eight is the right
*  record. You could argue they actually blew a couple of games they should have won, but that
*  means they're on pace for 48 and 24. So they're, they're on pace for like 54, 55 wins and that's
*  before the trade. So they're going to add one more piece to this. The other thing is they hit with
*  Kason Wallace, the guard they took, like that guy's good. He's playing for them. He hits threes. So,
*  All right, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to bet it and I'm not telling you to bet it.
*  I'm just saying I like the value. It doesn't even have to win, but if he doesn't get 50 votes,
*  which he had, you know, 46 last year, if he doesn't get 50, you have to ask Murph what his
*  deal is and what he believes in what he has until he answers. You have to repeatedly ask,
*  ask him until he answers. That's your punishment. I thought Yokage was going to cruise, but Denver's
*  down to 17 and 10. Yeah. And I don't know, are they going to get to 50 wins and, you know,
*  in beat versus Yokage has at least been an argument for the first third of the season. But
*  I think Shea, when you look at how young that team is, right? This is Chet's first year,
*  Jalen Williams' second year. They had that whole Josh Giddy situation, which nobody knows how
*  that's going to play out. They don't really have a deep bench. I think the fact that they're
*  a top two seed is pretty great. So that's the case. All right. I already bet you on this. I have to,
*  at the end of the year, I do have like four guys to look at. So you might as well have SGA in there.
*  I like the Yanis bet too. Yanis for the year is 31.6, 10.7 rebounds and five assists already. So
*  yeah, you know, but I just don't like the odds as much.
