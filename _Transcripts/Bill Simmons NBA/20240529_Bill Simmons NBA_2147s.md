# Wolves Extend the Series. Should the Mavs be a Little Nervous? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas)
*  Dallas had a chance to sweep Minnesota. They did not the timber wolves. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a classic timber wolves game. Jay Kyle man is here. Uh, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=4.44s)]
*  we got the full fledged timber wolves experience. We had some knucklehead fouls. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=7.8s)]
*  We had some dumb turnovers. We had an awful challenge. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=12.8s)]
*  We had some really stilted shot selection late and yet none of it mattered. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=16.48s)]
*  They played good defense. They made a couple stops. They made a couple shots. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=20.68s)]
*  They win the game. Now it is three one heading back to Minnesota. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=24.88s)]
*  Kyle considering they could have won all four of these games and they're down [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  three one. Like this feels like a closer three one than I think the usual three [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=33.68s)]
*  one, right? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=38.04s)]
*  Yeah, I feel a little, a little queasy about it because I'm like, you know, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=39.64s)]
*  you didn't really get great games from ant and cat in the first three. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=43.56s)]
*  And we kept just kind of waiting around like Rob and I were talking, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=47.52s)]
*  texting about, I was like, the ant game is surely coming. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Like we're going to get some semblance of a good game. You know, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=53.92s)]
*  tonight he was 11 for 25, two for five from three, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=56.44s)]
*  picked his spots pretty 10 rebounds and nine assists. I mean, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  he had a lot of the pass before the pass kind of plays. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=64.6s)]
*  He didn't necessarily make, you know, the pass, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=68.12s)]
*  like the home run pass basically the way Luca frequently does. But yeah, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=71.2s)]
*  overall I thought, I mean, we'll talk about cat. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=75.92s)]
*  It seemed like their athleticism was a little bit more impactful in some key [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=79.12s)]
*  spots. There's some other stuff at Dallas, but you know, it, yeah, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=83.2s)]
*  I mean it was, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=86.28s)]
*  it seemed like they were spinning plates throughout this game to keep the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=87.36s)]
*  offense going. You never really felt like, well, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=90.36s)]
*  that's just something they're going to over and over again every single time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=92.48s)]
*  But they managed to get a big enough game out of cat to kind of, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=95.88s)]
*  not as much nauseous game, but a big enough game out of cat to, to seal the deal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=98.88s)]
*  Yeah. So timely town shots. Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=103.16s)]
*  I was trying to figure out what they were doing because they were playing a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=105.44s)]
*  little freer and a little looser. They spread the floor better for ant. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=108.28s)]
*  They're doing a little three, one action with them. And, uh, he took, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=112.36s)]
*  he had 25 shots, eight free throws, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=115.64s)]
*  and just in general felt more involved. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=119.08s)]
*  They have some of the same trouble the Celtics do when, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=121.72s)]
*  when the Celtics go into fun, although in the Indiana series, they didn't do this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=124.56s)]
*  Um, when it's late, they just go slow. They like, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=128.48s)]
*  the ball goes over mid court. They're 17 seconds on the shot clock. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=132.84s)]
*  They're dribbling 40 feet for the basket. There's like eight seconds left. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=136.44s)]
*  And you're like, go faster, faster, move, move, move. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=139.56s)]
*  But it worked out for them a couple of times. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=142.32s)]
*  The big sequence was they're down one and it felt like Dallas was going to do [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=143.96s)]
*  the Marion Rivera closer on them again. And, uh, town sets two threes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=147.72s)]
*  The first one was like a no, no, yes. Three. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=153.08s)]
*  The second one Edwards found them in the corner and that one, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=155.56s)]
*  you felt like that one was going in, but they were up five. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  And once they got that little cushion, that was it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  We got to talk about towns because this was when we send the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=164.4s)]
*  towns, whatever hall of fame he ends up going to, that's probably, maybe, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  maybe it's the basketball hall of fame, but it's some other hall of fame too. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=173.24s)]
*  It's like the frustrating hall of fame, the, the, uh, my God, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=176.08s)]
*  what a roller coaster ride hall of fame, whatever it is, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=180.36s)]
*  you would send this game tape. He gets six fouls. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  All six were terrible fouls. There wasn't one like, uh, wow, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=186.36s)]
*  he can't blame him on that one. These were fouls. There was fouls at mid court. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  There was, he's fouling Luca on threes from 28 feet. Uh, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=194.56s)]
*  each time he didn't think it was a foul. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  There was an over the back. There was a back. He played the hits. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=200.8s)]
*  It really was like I was saying, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=205.4s)]
*  it really was arguably his magnum opus in terms of dumb fouls. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=207.32s)]
*  And then he caps it off with a foul and a closeout game. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=211.04s)]
*  It like really like just what are you doing? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=215.24s)]
*  And then the way he was pleading about it and arguing about it, you were like, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=217.0s)]
*  what are you doing? Like, you know, you fouled him. Like, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=221.16s)]
*  I don't even know what he was arguing about. Like it was a clear foul. Uh, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=223.32s)]
*  and Luca baited him right into it, man. And he took the bait. Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=226.68s)]
*  Townes is the Michael Jordan of complaining in disbelief on a foul that then [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=229.72s)]
*  they show the replay and it's like, oh yeah, that's clearly a foul. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=234.72s)]
*  He gets his sixth foul. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Luca does the little baits him into the double pump and then leans into him on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  the three at the top of the key and Townes crashes into him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  Then he's just in disbelief. They called it, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  but I got to say he had some big rebounds in the second half in traffic. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=249.04s)]
*  There was a point where I felt like maybe Finch just leaves them in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  and just has them fall out naturally to get them out of the game versus [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=259.0s)]
*  like having to bench him. It's like, Oh, well, you know, you got six fouls. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=264.32s)]
*  You can't play anymore. But, um, you know, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=267.96s)]
*  there was a moment during the second quarter I was making up town's trades [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=270.88s)]
*  cause I knew I was going to ask you about this. I was like, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=275.2s)]
*  does the Nas like ascendance affect the way we feel about this? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, cause it was just like, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=282.8s)]
*  it did seem like there was a little correlation between, um, between, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=284.0s)]
*  when, when Nas would get out there, when they would play with that, that quote, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  unquote, heavy quote, unquote, smaller lineup. But I was wondering that too. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  I was going to ask you about that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=294.84s)]
*  Townes it feels like should have more advantages in this series than he does. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=296.44s)]
*  Right. He's, he's basically bigger than everyone on, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=300.44s)]
*  on the Timberwolves is not a center. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=304.0s)]
*  He does. He can't really post up with his back to the basket. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=306.67999999999995s)]
*  When he tries to post up somebody like PJ Washington doesn't really work out [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=310.24s)]
*  well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=313.4s)]
*  So it's a lot of like on the perimeter stuff and they know that's coming and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=313.96s)]
*  they're just kind of sticking with them. Um, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=317.44s)]
*  it feels like there should be more advantages for him in this series than [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=320.64s)]
*  there is, but I think this speaks to why towns is such a strange player. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=323.84s)]
*  Like he's somebody that, you know, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  averaged 25 and 10 during his career. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=329.44s)]
*  And yet a lot of it is like this perimeter based or put back shots, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=332.56s)]
*  but doesn't he never really developed that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=335.96s)]
*  Let me at least get on the right block and I can spin into the lane and do my [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  little jump hook. Like he just doesn't seem to have that arsenal in games like [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=342.92s)]
*  this, which is 28 years old. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=346.48s)]
*  Early in his career, he had a little bit of that, like either shoulder kind of, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=349.12s)]
*  you know, jump hook thing going on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=352.88s)]
*  Yeah. Like a Duncan ish thing, right? Like just a little bit, but it's gone. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=354.8s)]
*  It was pretty simple. You know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=359.64s)]
*  you'd see him get a little of that like back to the basket sort of fade thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=361.0s)]
*  But I mean playing with go bear, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  I think makes some of that a little bit tougher because you're always going to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=366.32s)]
*  have somebody kind of sagging into the gap to bother those types of shots. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  And then the big thing I think for him is just that since he hadn't been shooting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=373.84s)]
*  the ball super well, you know, he'd been sort of attacking from so far. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  Dallas had done such a good job of making him start further from the basket. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  And Kat is like a one or two dribble repertoire type guy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=385.84s)]
*  He's not like a put together two or three, four dribble type things. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  When you get him in, I mean, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=394.28s)]
*  he had some amazing plays against Denver too down the stretch where he was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=395.28s)]
*  attacking off of like two dribbles and getting to, and he's so big. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=398.8s)]
*  And he does finish with some, you know, angularity fairly well. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=402.08s)]
*  But I think when you push him out there and you make him dance a little bit, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=405.88s)]
*  he just becomes a little more clumsy and indecisive and picks up stupid fouls. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=408.6s)]
*  But when he started shooting the ball, well, you saw PJ go like, shit, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=413.32s)]
*  I'm going to have to close on this guy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=416.92s)]
*  And then that's when he kind of has a little more leverage and is a little bit [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=418.2s)]
*  more effective. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=421.44s)]
*  I can't say I've been knocked out by Minnesota strategizing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  General kind of the mental stuff that goes into playoff games and like kind of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=429.6s)]
*  shooting yourself in the foot. Some of the coaching stuff, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=434.92s)]
*  some of the lineups they've had, even the stuff they figured out in this game. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure why they didn't figure out that stuff. Like after game one, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  some of the stuff they tried to do with Luca, putting ant on Luca, which. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, a little less Jayden on it was like, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  there was just like a real stinky vibe of frustration when Jayden was on Luca [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  because Luca just had his number. Like he could, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=457.0s)]
*  he negated all of his strengths and with ant, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=459.24s)]
*  ant had a couple of gambles at times like that are, that are tough with, with, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=461.44s)]
*  with Luca. But overall you just didn't see as much of that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=465.6s)]
*  I thought Luca was like insanely aggressive in that first quarter, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=469.04s)]
*  like offensively like with his dribble pull-up game. But yeah, yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=472.6s)]
*  The ant thing was, was working a little bit better, but yeah, they went, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=476.68s)]
*  they went to that maybe a little too late, honestly. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=479.96s)]
*  Luca was seven for 21. He still ended up with a 28, 15, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=482.04s)]
*  and 10 and I didn't even feel like he played that well. He made a crazy, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=487.04s)]
*  what seemed to be a four point play when they're down a 103 97 with like less [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=491.68s)]
*  than 20 seconds left and gets fouled on a three, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=498.24s)]
*  which somehow goes in and then missed the free, missed the free throw. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=501.76s)]
*  And that was kind of. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=506.92s)]
*  I don't know why I just had a feeling. It just felt, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=508.04s)]
*  but you could just sense it that it was going to happen. I don't know. Yeah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=510.6s)]
*  And then Kyrie sucked tonight too. He was six for 18, four turnovers. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  And you know, this is, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=518.4s)]
*  this is pretty easy to reduce this series to the Kyrie and Luca points versus [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=520.4s)]
*  the town's ant points. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=524.6s)]
*  But this was the first time they won the battle and not coincidentally they [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  won the game. Can we talk a little Luca here? Absolutely. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=529.24s)]
*  Did anything that happened in the last four weeks changed how you felt about him [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=533.32s)]
*  as a star and what his ceiling was, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=539.12s)]
*  or do you feel like this is stuff he's just been doing all along? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=542.4s)]
*  It's just finally on a bigger stage. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=545.36s)]
*  Well, I had him number four in the young player rankings and I just wanted to get [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=547.44s)]
*  that. That's a joke. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=552.08s)]
*  What were those young player rankings? I was getting texts. I'm like, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=554.68s)]
*  I didn't even know what that was. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=558.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was just to stay off the internet day. Anyway, I don't know. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=561.08s)]
*  I don't really feel like I need to defend my stance on Luca. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=565.08s)]
*  I've been pretty, pretty, go watch my first Luca video on my own channel. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=567.72s)]
*  If anybody wants to litigate my feelings on him, I'm sometimes too far on Luca. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  Like I think he's incredible. Wait, what, what, what about Luca specifically? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=577.2s)]
*  I mean like, Oh, did my feelings change? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=581.84s)]
*  The last four weeks, did anything change about what you had already thought? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=583.96s)]
*  I mean, I thought he was like in the top three in the world for sure. And you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=588.44s)]
*  know, he's kind of hovered in that top three to five range, but like, you know, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=592.9200000000001s)]
*  the movement of some of these guys not being able to, you know, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=596.96s)]
*  out of sight of the mind with Steph a little bit, LeBron's aged out. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  Durant has kind of moved out of that and you've seen Jokic and Donchit kind of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=602.32s)]
*  move forward. I still had Jokic as the best player in the world. But I mean, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=606.88s)]
*  Luca's right there. So honestly, no, not really. I mean, he's, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=611.76s)]
*  I've had a lot of respect for his game and that hasn't really changed much at [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  all in the past four weeks. He's just, I mean, what, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=619.12s)]
*  what more do we need to see from him? I mean, he's already, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=621.24s)]
*  he's already done it in big playoff stages to this point. So, you know, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=624.12s)]
*  the finals will be nice, but no, I haven't had a huge shift. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=627.2800000000001s)]
*  He's going to be an unbelievable, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=629.88s)]
*  I assuming it's going to be Mav Celtics unless we have the biggest comeback in [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=631.4s)]
*  the history of basketball. He's going to be an unbelievable villain. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=635.32s)]
*  I was on some text threads with some Celtic fan friends and we're, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=639.44s)]
*  we're just all ready. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=642.76s)]
*  We're just ready to be annoyed by this guy for two weeks. Even today, he's, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  I would say the Mavs actually got a more favorable whistle than, than, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=649.44s)]
*  Dallas in this game. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=653.88s)]
*  Everybody in Minnesota felt like they were in foul trouble at one point and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=655.12s)]
*  Lucas still, every time they go to timeout, he's going under the red. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=658.2s)]
*  And it looks like he's like pleading with a meter made not to, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=661.72s)]
*  not to put the ticket on the car. It's just his demeanor. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=665.32s)]
*  I think it's going to go over great in Boston. He is, he is, uh, oh no, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=668.76s)]
*  it's going to go terribly. He's going to get razzed, yelled, heckled. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  People are going to hate him. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  How many, how many shut the fuck ups per game do you think you're going to get [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=678.0s)]
*  in that Boston accent for, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=681.36s)]
*  Luca does the, Luca does the ultimate, uh, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=687.2s)]
*  he does the ultimate masterful thing where when he gets calls, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=690.0s)]
*  he complains and pouts. He does the thing like, he's just like, Oh, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=693.12s)]
*  like finally it's like really man come on. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=696.6s)]
*  And I think a funny thing about this series is just the, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  the sort of hand fighting that has been allowed to go on that has been to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=702.52s)]
*  Minnesota's advantage to this point, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=705.84s)]
*  like that colliding with the way that Luca plays, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=708.16s)]
*  I think has just created so many more of these moments. And it, yeah, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=711.4s)]
*  I agree with you. It has at times felt like Minnesota's gotten a tough whistle, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=714.4s)]
*  but that's just the, Luca drags you into the mud and like, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  that's the way he plays. And he knows that when guys get out of position, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=722.24s)]
*  he knows how to create the contact, how to make it look a certain way. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=725.8s)]
*  He finishes through contact. Um, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=729.4s)]
*  he just doesn't let you off the hook ever basically with that stuff. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=731.64s)]
*  Yeah. And everything is so purposeful. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=735.12s)]
*  Whereas you're watching Edwards at age 22 and it's such a work in progress. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  Like today he's like, I have to get to the room or my team's going to lose. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=740.64s)]
*  And he's like, I'm going to try to get to the room. Oh, they blocked me. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=744.96s)]
*  I'm going to dribble it back out. I'm going to wait five seconds. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=747.0s)]
*  I'm going to try to get to the room again. That's not the area there. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=749.12s)]
*  I'm going to spin back. I'm going to try to get to the room again. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=752.28s)]
*  And it was like watching the super early Jordan tapes from like [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=754.52s)]
*  87, 88 or like watching Kobe in the first few years where they, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=759.08s)]
*  they knew what they had to do, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=764.08s)]
*  but they didn't have the whole toolbox yet to do what they needed to do. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=765.28s)]
*  So it was just like, I am going to use my athletic ability and I'm going to get [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=769.52s)]
*  to the room and good things will happen. And then occasionally, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=772.84s)]
*  I think one of the things that makes him special is he'll just randomly pull out [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=776.44s)]
*  like just the gorgeous Tim Duncan 15 foot bank shot, you know, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=779.76s)]
*  and he'll just soar above. And it's just, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=784.08s)]
*  so you can see like two, three years from now when he can combine like the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=786.2s)]
*  pace with the acceleration and then he'll have the turnaround jumper in two [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=790.92s)]
*  years, that'll be in his bag. He'll have that bank shot. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  He'll probably have some sort of on the corner thing that, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=799.04s)]
*  that he'll be able to do. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  He'll be able to shoot threes off picks better and it'll just be like five [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=803.16s)]
*  little small things and he'll be at 30 points a game. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=806.9599999999999s)]
*  Like he'll be a 30 points a game guy within two years, right? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=809.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think that, I mean, you could, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=813.24s)]
*  you could kind of quibble about like how efficient he'll be doing that, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=814.64s)]
*  but I think that he's done a lot better job. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=817.64s)]
*  I think he's done a lot better job picking his spots. I mean, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=820.9200000000001s)]
*  that was the main thing that really, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=823.48s)]
*  really worried me coming into the league and in his first season in the league. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=824.72s)]
*  But you kind of see, I was talking with Kevin about this on the, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=828.52s)]
*  on the draft show that like, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=831.24s)]
*  you see scores like Ant come into the league and they have almost like I always, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=834.0s)]
*  the comparison I make is they have like four by three aspect ratio with the way [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=838.24s)]
*  they see the court. They're like, I'm either going to score, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=841.96s)]
*  I'm going to make this simple kind of pass to my guy. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=844.4s)]
*  And you kind of see them as they get older, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=847.0799999999999s)]
*  expand out to 16 nine where it's like they can see the sort of width of the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=849.64s)]
*  floor a lot better. And you're seeing Ant do that stuff. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=854.84s)]
*  But I do think it's interesting to kind of like compare them developmentally [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=857.72s)]
*  where it's like, I've been reflecting, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=860.88s)]
*  you were talking about has it shifted with Luca? Like it's like, do it, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  do we fully appreciate him? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  And I was just thinking back about when he came into the league and it's like, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=868.4s)]
*  it is kind of absurd, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=871.76s)]
*  especially looking at the lack of talent in this class and you look at the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=873.28s)]
*  international guys, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=875.84s)]
*  it is kind of absurd how much some people disrespected the quality of the Euro [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=876.48s)]
*  league when like you consider like an 18 year old winning the MVP, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=881.96s)]
*  like how insane that is. And just watching their processing speed, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=885.48s)]
*  Ant's athleticism gives him such a huge advantage to even get into the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=889.88s)]
*  conversation. But it's like Luca, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=893.52s)]
*  it just kind of shows you how far ahead Luca is. Grannie is a little older, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=895.72s)]
*  but like he was doing that stuff at, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=900.16s)]
*  he was doing a lot of those really, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  really advanced reads at this age that Ant is at now. And I, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=904.64s)]
*  I just think he's, I think he's the best pick and roll player in the world. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=909.16s)]
*  I think he's, I was telling you, I think he's arguably the best ever. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=911.8s)]
*  You could kind of quibble about Nash, but I just think he's a phenomenal, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=914.64s)]
*  phenomenal talent. Yeah. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=919.16s)]
*  Yeah. It's tough cause in the seventies and eighties, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=921.4s)]
*  they weren't thinking about setting screens that far away from the basket. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=923.52s)]
*  Right. A lot of it, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=926.92s)]
*  the big thing was like either the two man game or setting somebody a pick at [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=927.96s)]
*  like the foul line. Cause everything was so compacted, you know, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=933.76s)]
*  and the three point shots spread it out. So sometimes I think, you know, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=937.88s)]
*  there's so many guys from that era who would have been so interesting with the [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=941.44s)]
*  way basketball is played now. But he's, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=944.5600000000001s)]
*  he seems like the most unstoppable version of sent me a pick 30 feet from the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=947.96s)]
*  basket and the other team doesn't really know what to do. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=953.0400000000001s)]
*  They were talking today a lot on the telecast about go bear kept like sagging [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=956.28s)]
*  off and Reggie and staying in Van Gundy didn't understand why he kept sagging [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=960.84s)]
*  off. But I think it was because they just decided they didn't want to give up [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=965.4s)]
*  that, uh, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=970.92s)]
*  that little like lob for the little eight foot or the roll or the dunk or [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=971.84s)]
*  whatever. And they were just basically like, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=975.52s)]
*  let's just try to play good defense on Luca and stay near him and hope he misses [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  some shots. I liked the shots he took today. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=982.0s)]
*  A lot of them just weren't going in. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=984.08s)]
*  I'm not sure that strategy is going to work again in game five. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  It's almost like in football where each series you gotta switch the defense that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=988.2s)]
*  you're throwing at them. So in game five, they're going to have to, you know, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=992.9200000000001s)]
*  they can't run back the exact same thing. Cause he's too good. He'll figure it [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=996.44s)]
*  out. Um, the one thing I felt like from a Dallas standpoint, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=999.6800000000001s)]
*  they got like, they got this crazy Jayden hearted Hardy stretch. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  I think they were about to lose by like double figures and then Jayden Hardy had [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1009.0400000000001s)]
*  this really crazy, awesome stretch that kind of pulled them, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1012.68s)]
*  kept them kind of lingering around in the game cause they weren't playing that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  well. Uh, on the road, you're not getting those, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1019.0799999999999s)]
*  you're not getting the Jayden Hardy taking over the game for four minutes. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1025.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The young guys gets, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1026.2s)]
*  gets a beer muscles and feels a little bit bigger, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1027.9199999999998s)]
*  but Hardy's a guy who's just like historically always had crazy, crazy confidence. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1030.24s)]
*  He like, he did a good job. I will say on court, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1033.9199999999998s)]
*  he did a good job of like not overdoing it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1039.2s)]
*  I felt like he maybe had one spot, maybe another where he did that. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1041.52s)]
*  But like, I will say like, I know you're confident, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1044.84s)]
*  but like I don't know about barking at Anthony Edwards. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1048.16s)]
*  Like I don't know if that's the move. Um, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1051.4s)]
*  I would maybe just kind of stay in my lane a little bit. Like don't, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1053.68s)]
*  even if you think you're better than him, just like, don't tempt faith there. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1056.88s)]
*  That was, that was a questionable move to me. I was like, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1059.96s)]
*  I know he speaks how confident he is that he would go and do that, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1062.44s)]
*  but I don't know that I would have. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1065.16s)]
*  Yeah. They probably told him after the game, listen, if you're going to talk shit, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1067.2s)]
*  just talk shit to Rudy go bear. That's what we're all doing. Just say stuff to him. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1069.88s)]
*  Nobody likes Rudy go bear. It'll be, it'll be all fine. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1074.4s)]
*  He's the pin cushion where we put all. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1077.2s)]
*  So when you watch Rudy in a series like this and you know, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1080.5600000000002s)]
*  they're, they're almost definitely going to lose because again, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1085.0800000000002s)]
*  the only way for them to win this series is to do something nobody's done in 150 [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1088.0800000000002s)]
*  plus series. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1092.2s)]
*  Is Rudy somebody that you can win four straight playoff series with just in [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1094.24s)]
*  general, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1098.92s)]
*  with all the different styles of teams you have to play over the course of four [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1099.96s)]
*  rounds. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1103.5600000000002s)]
*  Is it just conceivable that he's a guy who could be on a title team? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1104.92s)]
*  Cause I've changed my mind 20 times on this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1112.0s)]
*  I don't know that I would blame him for this in particular because you know, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1113.0s)]
*  they have other problems that you were talking about. I, I honestly feel like you, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1117.8000000000002s)]
*  you made a really good comparison, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1121.76s)]
*  I think with the Boston and Minnesota thing offensively, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1123.0800000000002s)]
*  because when the core of your team is our guys that are sort of guys with [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1125.3999999999999s)]
*  scoring tilt who are learning to play, make you kind of run into these, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1129.8s)]
*  these guys like Tatum and Brown, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1134.04s)]
*  both are like they've been learning on the job since they've been playing [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1135.4399999999998s)]
*  together to sort of learn to play that way. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't always come instinctively. Whereas you watch, uh, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1140.76s)]
*  I was like prodding you the other night with the Halliburton text about, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1144.0s)]
*  is he the best in the series? And then you mentioned that I laughed at that, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1147.56s)]
*  but, uh, no, I mean like, like a Halliburton or somebody, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1150.84s)]
*  when you have a guy like that at the core of your team, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1154.32s)]
*  you're not going to run into those problems as much. So, but, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  so just to speak to Rudy though, like I think that it can happen. It's just, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  maybe he's just somebody that you have to be smart about when he's on and off [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1162.9199999999998s)]
*  the floor because that, you know, Minnesota has kind of done that in spots. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1166.52s)]
*  And you've seen that like tonight, his impact defensively was there. Like, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1170.24s)]
*  I think the fact that they didn't have lively there as a lob threat when, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1174.24s)]
*  when Gafford wasn't in there, uh, Kyrie, you could see, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1178.28s)]
*  Kyrie was affected by Rudy, I think in some pretty key moments. Um, and, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1181.8799999999999s)]
*  and this is, you know, this is a, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1186.2s)]
*  whether or not it's this round or it's the finals or the first round, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1187.68s)]
*  this is a high, high level matchup. And, uh, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1190.56s)]
*  he affected the game in a positive way. I thought in the short roll, he actually, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1193.0s)]
*  you know, he actually had some pretty good moments. I thought he wasn't required [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1197.8s)]
*  to like do anything like heavy improv, but he finished pretty well. I thought. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1200.96s)]
*  And, uh, yeah, it did play within himself in that sense offensively. I thought. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1205.68s)]
*  Well, he had been dirt had been poured on his entire career over the last two [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1209.88s)]
*  days. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  I was thinking about like the take seesaw on certain guys where if the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1214.44s)]
*  seesaw normally you want to see saw that's a little balanced and it goes a [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1219.0400000000002s)]
*  little up a little down. And with Rudy, it's like one side of the see-haw is, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  seesaw is always in the ground. And then if it flips to the other side, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1228.0s)]
*  it's back on the ground. Like he's either the defensive player of the year, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1231.64s)]
*  or he's the biggest liability in the league. And there's just no, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1234.76s)]
*  no balancing the both. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1238.3600000000001s)]
*  I actually thought some of the stuff towns did with him today towns had a couple [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1239.5200000000002s)]
*  of nice little dishes to him on drives and, uh, you know, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1243.0s)]
*  felt like they complimented each other. But, um, there's other times. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1246.5200000000002s)]
*  To me it's on Minnesota. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1250.72s)]
*  Like when he's 35 feet from the basket trying to guard Luca, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1252.0s)]
*  it's just not going to go well. And you know, if you see the reverse, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1255.5600000000002s)]
*  like Dallas is really smart. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1259.0800000000002s)]
*  Anytime they had somebody in a position that far away from the basket, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1260.6000000000001s)]
*  they weren't happy with, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1263.5200000000002s)]
*  they would just send a second guy out and then try to recover fast. And, uh, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1264.56s)]
*  it felt like Minnesota really wasn't doing that that much until today. So who [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1269.4399999999998s)]
*  knows? They might, it feels like they're getting a little better. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1274.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you'd think on the other side of Dallas, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1277.56s)]
*  it might they were getting a little worse. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1279.36s)]
*  And some of the stuff that was working for them, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1280.76s)]
*  the other games wasn't working as well. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1282.84s)]
*  The big catch is that they didn't have lively. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1284.12s)]
*  And I never thought we would be saying like last fall, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1287.08s)]
*  I never ever thought that we would be having this conversation in a conference [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  finals. Like I liked lively, but like, I'm shocked by this. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1294.08s)]
*  Well, he was a really polarizing, we were doing the draft pods and you know, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1298.84s)]
*  I didn't follow college hoops. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1302.9199999999998s)]
*  So I'm leaning on you guys and studying YouTube clips, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1304.6s)]
*  but lively was the most polarizing guy in that top, top 12, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1308.48s)]
*  because especially when he went to Dallas, I remember, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1312.76s)]
*  was it you or was it KLC where somebody was like, Oh, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1316.36s)]
*  that's actually like, that's a team that plays to his strengths. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1319.3999999999999s)]
*  That's a pretty good fit for him. But I mean, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1323.2s)]
*  to think that he would be playing and somebody that could pass out of like [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1325.24s)]
*  those little lobs and just the creativity that he's had at that position for his [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1329.76s)]
*  age, I think has been unusual. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1333.84s)]
*  So somehow they get rewarded for throwing away the season last year, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1336.36s)]
*  which I still can't figure out. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1339.56s)]
*  Yeah. When he was in high school, he got rated, I think, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1341.04s)]
*  like people were projecting what he could be actually like the shooting was [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1344.12s)]
*  something that was a piece of the puzzle for him that people thought he would [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1347.2s)]
*  shoot it eventually. And I'm not ruling that out, but I mean, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1349.72s)]
*  it seems fairly unlikely, but like he, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1352.3200000000002s)]
*  he just kind of defensively looked lost at times, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1355.28s)]
*  but the more that you leaned in and watched it, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1358.3200000000002s)]
*  the kind of conclusion I came to was just that he was thinking so much that his [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1360.24s)]
*  reaction time was getting kind of negated and you saw him sort of like learn. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1364.0400000000002s)]
*  And if you listen to the guy talk, he's a bright kid, like, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1368.2s)]
*  and I think that he just sort of had to learn to play high level coverages and [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1370.64s)]
*  stuff. And, um, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1374.84s)]
*  is it possible though that some guys are just better with better teammates? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1376.6s)]
*  Cause I've always felt that way with basketball that we always forget that part [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1380.36s)]
*  that maybe like he was that Duke team was a mess a year ago, right? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1384.84s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't, they didn't really Duke has had a few teams like this, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1388.68s)]
*  where they didn't have a ton of great creators, like, uh, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1391.9199999999998s)]
*  in terms of like guys who could score and get off the ball, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1395.6399999999999s)]
*  they had like a guy named Jeremy Roach who was like a score to get off the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1398.68s)]
*  ball. And then they had a guy named Tyrese Proctor who could pass, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1401.28s)]
*  but he couldn't really score. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1403.84s)]
*  So you just had these weird spacing issues on those teams that did penalize, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1405.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, somebody like him where he's not a table setter. He, he's a, he's, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1409.4399999999998s)]
*  somebody, he's a patron. He dines and Luca obviously is the ultimate, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, three Michelin star chef. And he's, it couldn't have been, uh, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1417.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm, and I'm probably, I'm sure I probably did say it on draft night, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1421.36s)]
*  but a lot of people did that. Like he, he's a guy who can catch lobs. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1424.12s)]
*  He's very fast. He's very, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1427.6s)]
*  he has really great hip mobility for a guy his size. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1429.6s)]
*  And I wrote about this in the rookie guide over and over again, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1432.56s)]
*  that like you just absolutely could not have picked a better partner for him [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1435.44s)]
*  coming into the league. But I think in this game, um, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1439.48s)]
*  they did miss his short roll decision making in a way that I think like, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1442.24s)]
*  you know, Minnesota was like, okay, we're, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1446.4s)]
*  we will give you a little bit of drop coverage here, uh, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1448.92s)]
*  because we're not as worried about these lobs and we're not as worried about [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  maybe Derek Jones, junior shooting threes or PJ shooting threes. Uh, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1454.76s)]
*  and I think that affected them because you had to respect lively in the middle [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1458.36s)]
*  of the floor. And I think that kind of took away from some of their easy [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1461.8s)]
*  buckets, honestly. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1464.52s)]
*  So our friend Chris Lewinsky, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1466.56s)]
*  who has done incredible stuff with concussions really since the late [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1468.52s)]
*  2000s and every once in a while I mentioned him, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1472.72s)]
*  he had a tweet a couple of hours ago about lively in this next brain [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1475.68s)]
*  thing in the game three, because I watched it and I was like, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1480.72s)]
*  it was clear it was concussion. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1483.52s)]
*  He was groggy after and looked like, like his brains had been scrambled. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1485.6399999999999s)]
*  They had all the makings. Like if it happened in football, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1489.64s)]
*  we were just like, that's concussion. And they said next brain. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1491.88s)]
*  And Chris Lewinsky tweeted just two hours ago, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1495.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't believe the Derek lively next brain story in the NFL. That's concussion. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1498.88s)]
*  He couldn't stand for minutes. He's showing the clip that he has under the tweet. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1502.92s)]
*  You can see he can't balance and would fall walking without help. NBA, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1506.92s)]
*  please don't undo years of concussion education meant to protect kids. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1511.16s)]
*  I, uh, I thought from the evidence, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1516.48s)]
*  it was really hard for me to believe that was a sprained neck. And you know, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1519.72s)]
*  I think, I think maybe they were assuming that the, uh, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1523.48s)]
*  series would be over, but usually like a concussion, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1526.68s)]
*  like Jaylen Brown had one for the Celtics and he, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1528.72s)]
*  he wasn't right for over a week. Um, so we'll see. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1531.16s)]
*  Like people seem to think he's come back game five. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1535.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't know why they wouldn't tell us exactly what happened, but, um, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1538.0800000000002s)]
*  I think you and I both had the same reaction. That's pretty, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1541.72s)]
*  that's clearly seem like, I don't know how that wasn't a concussion. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1544.36s)]
*  That was hard to watch, man. I can't, I can't imagine like getting hit. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1547.6s)]
*  I mean, that's one, like you, I just don't, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1551.48s)]
*  I don't know how he got up from that at all. Like I thought for sure concussion, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1554.32s)]
*  maybe they just, uh, they said it's also an X frame. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1558.04s)]
*  Maybe he really does have an X frame, but he also has, I just, uh, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1560.84s)]
*  well he was on the bench today with it and it's bright in those arenas and he [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1565.12s)]
*  didn't have sunglasses on and was fine. So who knows? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1567.92s)]
*  I don't really know the answer, but I thought that was, uh, that was a weird one. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1571.04s)]
*  They're going to need him for a game five, Minnesota, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1574.76s)]
*  who has no home court advantage at all. And you would think like, well, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1577.44s)]
*  if anybody's going to come back from three, oh, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1581.2s)]
*  it's a team that has five and seven at home because you send it back. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1583.56s)]
*  You win five. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1588.4s)]
*  Then if you can somehow win six or put the other team in position to be on their [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1589.36s)]
*  heels in a game six at home, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1594.16s)]
*  knowing that have to go back to your place in a game seven, that's the, that, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1595.6s)]
*  that would be the sequence you'd want. And yet Minnesota sucks at home. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1599.04s)]
*  And everybody sucks at home. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1603.8799999999999s)]
*  We talked about this on the Mahoney Chris Ryan pod that we did on Thursday. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1605.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you have a theory on why home court has gone out the window? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1608.76s)]
*  No, honestly, I don't, I don't understand what it's, what it's about. Um, it's, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1612.76s)]
*  maybe, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1618.32s)]
*  maybe it's just that like a lot of these arenas sound the same or that like, I, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1618.72s)]
*  I honestly don't have any kind of idea that that maybe it's not as unique, uh, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1622.3999999999999s)]
*  the way, I mean, you're a historian on this. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1627.16s)]
*  Is there anything that's changed about the way they set up the seats or, you know, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1629.08s)]
*  I, I didn't, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1632.84s)]
*  and I feel like there aren't in as many like unique kind of quirks. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1633.32s)]
*  Like I feel like that stuff's all like audited really well. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1636.08s)]
*  Like the, the weird Milwaukee bucks court, like in the late seventies, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1638.48s)]
*  like you don't see anything like that really anymore. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1641.8s)]
*  People would always complain about like the, the Omni. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1643.72s)]
*  Then people used to say that the Omni was like kind of drafty in there that like, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1646.6s)]
*  I just feel like, I feel like everything is kind of, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1650.8s)]
*  that's true in a lot of different ways. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1654.16s)]
*  I just think things have just kind of become homogenized maybe. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1656.24s)]
*  And that's why it just doesn't feel as, uh, I don't know. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1658.96s)]
*  I'm grasping for straws for why, why it's happening. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1662.2s)]
*  No, I think that's a, that's a decent reason. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1664.4s)]
*  Like they say about the old Boston garden, like there was dead spots on the [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1666.56s)]
*  parquet, you know, people would smoke at halftime. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1669.8s)]
*  The whole place is filled with smoke. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1673.28s)]
*  You had cheaper seats. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1675.1200000000001s)]
*  You had the crowd was pretty close to the court and you know, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1676.36s)]
*  people that were really into the games, the locker rooms were terrible. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1680.04s)]
*  The Celtics would shut off the air conditioning or the heat, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1684.0s)]
*  depending on what time of season to fuck with the other team. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1686.36s)]
*  And like all that stuff's out the window. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1689.32s)]
*  I think the, what you said about everything being homogenous, like I do, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1690.8799999999999s)]
*  you feel that when you're watching four games at once on a Wednesday night, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1695.4399999999998s)]
*  it, you have no idea which arena is which. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1698.9199999999998s)]
*  They all seem the same. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1700.9599999999998s)]
*  The seats seem the same. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1702.32s)]
*  That's why what the Coopers are trying to do with this new arena is so [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1703.8s)]
*  interesting to me because they're going to have this wall of fans and they're [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1706.48s)]
*  going to have, uh, you know, they built it like the Indiana arena where the, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1712.04s)]
*  everybody's really close to the court. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  And if that doesn't make a difference, then maybe, maybe the ship has [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1718.68s)]
*  sailed on home court. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1724.0s)]
*  It's it happened in hockey. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1725.3999999999999s)]
*  Like we watched it happen over the last 20 years where all of a sudden it just [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1727.6s)]
*  didn't matter where you played in hockey. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1730.68s)]
*  You could win anywhere. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1732.08s)]
*  So, you know, so anyway, Minnesota is going back home and I don't know [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  if it makes a difference. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I, I don't know. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1739.08s)]
*  I think it kind of feels like, doesn't it really kind of feel like Dallas really [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  needs to win this next game? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  Because I feel like based on the way that last series went, I just, especially if [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1746.2s)]
*  you're not going to have lively. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1750.6799999999998s)]
*  And I was also thinking about the fact that lively kind of plays like in scrum [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1751.9199999999998s)]
*  all the time, he's always flying around. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1756.3999999999999s)]
*  He's always in traffic. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  He also has, he also is like a wide receiver running over the middle with like, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1759.72s)]
*  you know, these big bodies kind of looming. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1764.36s)]
*  I'm just kind of like, makes me wonder if he'll maybe be thinking about it a [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1766.72s)]
*  little bit, if that, if that's going to have an effect on him, but it does just [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1770.2s)]
*  kind of feel like the, the old shit meter is going to kind of start to go up a [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1774.3600000000001s)]
*  little bit if they can't, but I don't think that you're going to get the same, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1779.0s)]
*  like the shot making thing was just not there tonight, like in the way that it [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1781.68s)]
*  had been in the past three games. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1785.48s)]
*  And I just don't know per like the variance, if you're going to be able to [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1787.32s)]
*  bank on that happening again, if you're, if you're Minnesota 14 for 30 on threes [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1791.0s)]
*  tonight, towns who averaged 22 and eight during the season and was almost a 50, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1795.52s)]
*  45, 90 guys, 52, 47, 87, his seven games before tonight, he was 16 and 10, 37% [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1802.56s)]
*  shooting 17% from three. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1810.2s)]
*  And then tonight he was four for five from three, 25 and five, six fouls. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  It was the town's easiest game possible for better and worse. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1818.12s)]
*  Just out of curiosity, I did make up a couple of towns trades thinking that they [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1822.04s)]
*  might lose tonight. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1825.24s)]
*  We had, he's got four years, 221 million after the season, but he's 36 million. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1826.48s)]
*  Basically through June. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1833.92s)]
*  So his cat figure is actually pretty tradable for trades. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1835.28s)]
*  I'm just going to throw these at you. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1840.4s)]
*  By the way, he's still in the playoffs. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1843.28s)]
*  I feel bad, but this is good content. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1844.76s)]
*  I'm just doing it. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1846.72s)]
*  This is going to be a door. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1847.6s)]
*  It's like assuming, assuming Minnesota is out, which is going to end. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1849.44s)]
*  And it's like, ah, wow. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1853.68s)]
*  Towns didn't play that well. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1854.88s)]
*  Towns to Washington for Kuzma in the second pick too much or too little. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1856.92s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1862.5600000000002s)]
*  You wouldn't do that. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1864.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1866.0400000000002s)]
*  Cause remember they have, they're going to be like 70 over, they're going to be [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1866.76s)]
*  like second apron, the whole thing with the con with the salaries they have now. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1869.72s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's true. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1874.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm just not a big Kuzma guy. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1876.4s)]
*  And I'm trying to think about it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1877.8400000000001s)]
*  If you ever were ever not going to do it in a draft, I feel like it would be this [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1878.92s)]
*  one because you know, they're not going to be in the SAR business. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1882.6s)]
*  I wouldn't think what the types of defenders they have. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1885.08s)]
*  And I'm trying to think of who else would even, they're not going to get [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1887.76s)]
*  clinging, maybe Rob Dillingham or somebody really talented. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1890.04s)]
*  You take a chance on that. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1893.52s)]
*  I don't, I don't know that I go, what's it, what's it? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1895.0s)]
*  Conley replacement? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1896.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1897.6s)]
*  Dillingham and Conley. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1898.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1899.6399999999999s)]
*  I'll be curious to get your opinion on that one in a month if we revisit this, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1901.1999999999998s)]
*  but what's, what's the next one? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1904.3999999999999s)]
*  Just towns in Ingram, some sort. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1907.12s)]
*  I don't know who throws in what, but, uh, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1910.1999999999998s)]
*  a little flipper with those two guys. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1912.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a little intriguing. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1916.28s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1919.04s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it kind of makes you wonder what they would be doing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1920.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1923.28s)]
*  And then you'd have towns with the Pelicans is interesting. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1923.7199999999998s)]
*  It is give them a little bit more spacing with some of those creators. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1928.36s)]
*  Give them towns, towns with Zion. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1931.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, there's a big bet that he's even healthy, but towns with Zion [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1934.08s)]
*  would be pretty interesting. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1937.28s)]
*  Well, that's what I was thinking for New Orleans. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1938.1999999999998s)]
*  I think you do it in five seconds. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1940.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1941.9599999999998s)]
*  For Minnesota with Ingram, he's got an extension coming. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1942.28s)]
*  I think I need more than Ingram, especially like Ingram come off. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1945.16s)]
*  He was bad in team USA. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1949.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't think he had a great season. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1950.64s)]
*  Uh, I don't think he's a distressed asset, but, um, but I think it would [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1952.96s)]
*  have, you'd have to get some picks in that one too. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1957.3600000000001s)]
*  There's towns for Murray and Capella is expiring. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1959.88s)]
*  It's expired next year, but could you turn towns into Dejante Murray? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1964.28s)]
*  Does that make sense for either team? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1968.8s)]
*  We'd get towns and Trey Young together. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1970.52s)]
*  That's there's something there. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1973.08s)]
*  And then, uh, could he be in a three team or a four teamer with my ring around the [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1974.84s)]
*  Rosie, as you know, my, one of my summer missions is to get McHale bridges to the [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1980.76s)]
*  Knicks because I think that's what the Knicks want, but could towns go to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1985.44s)]
*  Brooklyn Randall and a first goes to Minnesota or Randall and a first goes to [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1988.96s)]
*  Atlanta and Trey Young goes somewhere and Bridges goes to the next, maybe [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1994.48s)]
*  there's some sort of, there's like an asset merry-go-round that towns could be [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=1999.4s)]
*  a part of, I gotta say, I, I probably, if those were my four trades, I think I'm [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2003.96s)]
*  keeping towns for another year. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2010.52s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2012.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2013.76s)]
*  Cause I think all of that stuff either sends me backwards or sideways. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2014.48s)]
*  And I already know what I have. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2021.8s)]
*  I have a team that made the conference finals and towns, the really two bad [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2023.04s)]
*  years of his deal doesn't kick in for two more years. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2027.28s)]
*  So I think not to do the thing where I started an argument with myself and [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2030.2s)]
*  then talk myself out of it, but I think those are the type of trades on the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2034.08s)]
*  table. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2037.8s)]
*  I don't think they're doing better than that kind of neighborhood. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2038.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2041.6s)]
*  I'm trying to think of offensively who could use him. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2042.48s)]
*  I like towns and Trey together. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2044.84s)]
*  Uh, God, I just think that that would be a reality TV show waiting to happen. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2046.88s)]
*  Um, you, you think about towns in Brooklyn and you're just like, well, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2051.92s)]
*  Brooklyn's just kind of void of form in general. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2055.12s)]
*  So it's like, sure. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2057.68s)]
*  Why not? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2058.44s)]
*  We'll take towns. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2058.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, yeah, I don't know. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  Murr, Murray with the, with the wolves, I think you, you ideally would want to [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2062.48s)]
*  get somebody with some like connective kind of playmaking in there. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2068.12s)]
*  Is that where, where do the wolves, let's say hypothetically, they lose the [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2071.08s)]
*  series and don't come back. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2074.7599999999998s)]
*  Where do you look for maybe an upgrade? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2076.72s)]
*  Conley has been such a steadying force, but you know, long-term, do you want to [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2079.2s)]
*  bet on him, right? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2082.6s)]
*  Like, do you want to bet on, uh, cause I mean, he looked down a couple of years [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2083.88s)]
*  ago when Brunson lit his ass up in the, in the, in the playoffs. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2087.56s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of like, how can they upgrade that because they don't [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2091.52s)]
*  really get as much of that playmaking out of Anderson all the time. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2095.08s)]
*  I'm just like, that's, that's where I see them needing an upgrade. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2097.96s)]
*  Uh, so turning towns into some sort of guard. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2101.32s)]
*  I think I agree because Conley to me, it's so funny cause you [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2103.6400000000003s)]
*  played with Horford forever. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2106.84s)]
*  He's very similar to Horford, right? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2108.8s)]
*  As a stop gap, big minutes guy. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2110.44s)]
*  Great. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2112.6s)]
*  But ultimately I'm not sure that's his destiny on a team that needs to win four [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2113.96s)]
*  straight rounds because he's old. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2118.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2119.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2120.04s)]
*  So you would want, you'd want him in that Horford role where he could play big [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2120.44s)]
*  minutes, but ultimately it would be, maybe you're better off if it's 20 to 25 [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2124.6s)]
*  minutes a game, picking spots when guys are resting, maybe he plays a big thing. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2128.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2133.8s)]
*  I don't know what the ideal town straight is. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6U4uAJhjas&t=2133.96s)]
