# Are the Celtics In Trouble With Porzingis Hurt? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWXALnp0rjA)
*  This is a guy that I should have on a lot more than I do, but I'm as always
*  awful at booking my own podcast.
*  You've seen him in Abu Dhabu.
*  You've seen him in Saudi Arabia.
*  You've seen him in basically every continent in the world.
*  And now it's in the U S covered in the NBA finals, Chris Bannix.
*  It's good to have you on, uh, on domestic soil.
*  You're one of my favorite guys, Bill, who comes out of the
*  woodwork for every big fight.
*  It's like you, it's Damien Lillard.
*  It's a handful of NBA coaches that when there's a big fight, they don't
*  quite know enough about, you know, my phone starts blowing up.
*  That's, that's me.
*  I am big fight bill.
*  I'm also a medium sized bill, a medium sized bill too for fights.
*  Yes.
*  But I helped you make a little bit of money.
*  I don't know if you doubled down on Usyk after you texted me, but you
*  texted me a little bit before the fight.
*  I said, you're going to make a good amount of money on Usyk.
*  I told you I bet on Usyk because that's my guy.
*  I love it.
*  I love him.
*  But, uh, in general, there's been a lot of good pay-per-view fights that are just
*  interesting enough to justify paying for them, but you wouldn't be telling
*  your grandkids about any of them.
*  That's where we've landed, uh, with boxing, at least until tank
*  gets the, uh, the right challenger.
*  But we're not here to talk about boxing.
*  We're here to talk about a Boston Celtics team that came out of two
*  O in Boston on Sunday night.
*  And it felt like they had solved Dallas.
*  I was trying to restrain myself on the pod with Rossello, but everything I had
*  seen, we've seen so many times in the finals or in really major series, there
*  hits a point with a series where you feel like one team has figured out the other
*  team and I felt that way in game two.
*  It's like they just figured out Dallas.
*  You remember this happened with Golden state in 2002 and game four, some point
*  in game four, Golden state just figured out Boston and it was a wrap after that.
*  I felt that way with Mavs Clippers round one.
*  I went to game five.
*  I was like, shit really seems like Dallas has just figured the Clippers out.
*  And it felt like Boston and figured them out.
*  Now we're pulling Porzingis possibly.
*  Out of this.
*  So now what happens, man, when it comes to Porzingis and his availability, uh,
*  my panic level is an 11.
*  If I, if I was as a Celtic supporter, I would make my panic level an 11 because.
*  Look, his value is, is incalculable to me.
*  Like I know they're 30 and five during this season without Porzingis nine and
*  one in the playoffs without Porzingis, but all you have to do is watch the first
*  two games of the series to see just how valuable he is.
*  I mean, he won game one for them, right?
*  Like it was 37 to 20 at the end of the first quarter.
*  Porzingis had 11 points in that game.
*  Yeah, the Mavs made it close in the third, but that game for all intents
*  and purposes was one in the first half.
*  And that was all, uh, Porzingis a little bit less effective, a little bit less
*  effective in game two, but he still got his points, still has a rebound, still
*  was a menace, you know, defending shots at the rim without him.
*  I think this becomes a loseable series for the Celtics.
*  I do believe that I, I have faith in Al Horford to step up, but I don't
*  have the numbers in front of me, but Al Horford, when he plays 30 minutes or less,
*  he's a lot better than Al Horford who plays 30 minutes or more.
*  He's just not a 30 plus per minute game, uh, per game player.
*  And that means we might see some Luke Cornett in this game three,
*  if Porzingis doesn't play.
*  And how about some Sam Hauser who was just ripping off bricks in game two
*  and looked like he lost his confidence.
*  I think how's he's going to play either way though, right?
*  Like I thought he was really good in game one.
*  He was two for three from the floor, two for two from three and he defended.
*  I mean, there were some Sam Hauser days where he was just, you know,
*  anti-defended.
*  I mean, there were some Sam Hauser defensive moments in game one.
*  He was awful in game two.
*  Uh, but he's going to play no matter what.
*  If Porzingis is healthy, Luke Cornett's not seeing the floor,
*  not until garbage time anyway.
*  And look, I think Luke Cornett is fine during the regular season, but the
*  minutes I've seen him play in the playoffs have been very shaky.
*  And if you're needing him to play 10 to 15 real minutes with Porzingis
*  out of the lineup, that would worry me if I was the Celtics.
*  This is the brisette spot that I've been crying for for two months.
*  Cause I actually think this is somebody that you can at least switch on
*  defense with them.
*  The KP thing, you mentioned the panic level being at 11.
*  You meant 11 for the entire season, day after day after day.
*  You didn't just mean this week.
*  This is a constant thing of every game you get through where Porzingis is healthy.
*  You feel great if you're a Celtic fan.
*  And the irony of that game on Sunday night was the game probably should have
*  been over five different times.
*  And each time Boston just couldn't land the knockout blow.
*  That was why I was such, it was weird doing the podcast that night with
*  Porzingis cause I was like trying to not be negative.
*  The Celts are up two nothing.
*  They're 78 20, you know, and we're nitpicking on, ah, Tate them.
*  I didn't love a shot selection, but there was a lack of just finish them off in
*  that game where they just, Dallas was dying to roll over and be done with it.
*  And they did, the Celtics just couldn't do it.
*  Now it's close in the last six, seven minutes and that's when Porzingis gets hurt.
*  So it was almost like them not being able to finish them off in the third quarter
*  when Dallas looked like they were ready to go home and kid put out Luca and
*  Kyrie together when normally rest of them.
*  Cause he knew like this, if I don't, if I don't save these two minutes here,
*  we're done anyway.
*  And then the Celtics can't finish them off.
*  So I'm with you.
*  They bring them in.
*  He changes, he changes the game.
*  He just makes it weird.
*  He changes what Dallas wants to do offensively.
*  He takes away their lobs.
*  Uh, he creates these mismatches on the other end.
*  And even in the six plays when he was hurt before they took them out,
*  Kyrie had that layup.
*  Rosselle and I talked about it Sunday that KP was coming behind and just
*  blocking against the backboard in game one and in game two, he didn't want to
*  jump and Kyrie got the layup.
*  And it's those little moments like that, that if I'm Dallas, I'm like, all right,
*  that guy's now gone either way, if he plays or if he's not, doesn't play that
*  guy's gone for the rest of the series.
*  I guess my question is, have you seen enough from Dallas to think that it's even
*  going to matter because this looks like a bad matchup for, for Dallas anyway.
*  So what do they, let's poke poor Zingas out.
*  What does Dallas need to do now?
*  What needs to happen?
*  Well, I think for starters, and it's, it's kind of cliche.
*  I think some of their role players will make shots at home, right?
*  Like I think PJ Washington will be better.
*  I think Derek Jones Jr.
*  Will be better.
*  Josh Green will be better.
*  These guys couldn't buy a bucket in that last game.
*  And I think.
*  How much does that have to do with the corner threes though?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's a big part of it, but they took them away, but they did miss some
*  open looks like they, they missed some open threes in that game.
*  And I think if you're Dallas, you can count on them being a little bit better at home.
*  I just got to believe there's at least one Kyrie game out there.
*  And look, I'm with the people that say it's a bad matchup for Kyrie.
*  Not only does he have, you know, three elite defenders coming at him in waves,
*  all game and Brown, Holliday and Derek White.
*  They're also making him defend on the other end of the floor.
*  They're putting him in action.
*  Sometimes he's on a switch against poor Zingas.
*  Sometimes he's faced with Jalen Brown.
*  They're forcing him to expend energy on that end of the floor, but he's too good
*  a player to be 0 for 8 in the next two games from three, like he's got to have.
*  At least one breakout game.
*  And that game too, was just close enough to make me believe if Kyrie has a breakout
*  game and if some of these role players start making some shots that they can take one
*  of them, probably game three.
*  And then all of a sudden you're looking at game four and you're saying is poor Zingas
*  going to play in that one?
*  What's he going to look like?
*  Then all of a sudden the pressure kind of shifts back to Boston for, for that one.
*  And you know, that's why I think that this, this is still very much a series, maybe
*  more so if poor Zingas is out.
*  I don't agree with you on the Kyrie thing, but I see the point.
*  No, no, I see the point.
*  You're right.
*  Cause he missed how many open threes in the first two games and maybe five of them were
*  wide open.
*  Yeah.
*  On the other hand, I thought what they were making Dallas do, and this was whether poor
*  Zingas was in the game or not, was just a lot of one-on-one stuff and a lot of, Hey
*  Luca and Kyrie, why don't you pretend you're in a sports movie and dribble through your
*  legs a few times and try to beat whoever's guarding you.
*  Which I don't really think is how Dallas advanced through the first three rounds.
*  I don't see that changing as much.
*  I'm with you on the role players.
*  The role players that to me are going to be helped the most without poor Zingas are the
*  two centers.
*  Cause now, now maybe the lab threat comes back in a little more great point on Horford.
*  The other thing is it's Wednesday, Friday.
*  This was the worst possible time for the century to happen.
*  Right.
*  Cause fitted first game Sunday after nine days off and then Thursday and then Sunday
*  was second game had some time off.
*  Then Wednesday, this game three, but then playing Friday, all of a sudden the series
*  could be two, two and 50 hours.
*  You know?
*  So if you're putting huge miles on Horford in game three, you also have to know we're
*  playing in two days.
*  Yeah.
*  Which Dallas has to know the same with Luca to be fair.
*  I mean, Luca, that one picture of him was wearing the full body wrap on the chest ribs
*  and the full like bag.
*  I mean, he looked like he looked like he was preparing to film like a Sarah life
*  sketch or something.
*  So I'm not sure that's going to help him that much either, but I obviously hurts
*  Horford the most because he's old.
*  Now, do you, do you walk away from game two thinking Luca figured some things out,
*  you know, because you have the one assistant game one, you had 10 more in, in game
*  two, I thought the Celtics were sending more doubles in game two than they did in
*  game one.
*  Is that kind of forecast game three, look ahead to game three.
*  Like if Porzingis is limited or not able to play, it becomes even more important
*  not to send doubles because we know if you send doubles at Luca, he's going to
*  carve you up.
*  He's going to find lobs.
*  He's going to find corner threes.
*  And without that rim protector in Porzingis, like the last thing you want for the
*  Celtics is for Derek Lively to get any confidence.
*  Like you don't want Daniel Gafford to start feeling himself, you know, during
*  these games.
*  You want these guys, you want these guys shooting like two time, like how many
*  shots is Derek Lively taken and made in this series?
*  Like three, like it's, you know, same thing with Gafford.
*  He's been kind of out of control.
*  I mean, he's had all kinds of dumb fouls and he just is kind of running around
*  like a chicken with his head cut out.
*  But the last thing a young guy, you want to give a young guy like that is any
*  confidence.
*  Like you should want him to, to feel out of his element.
*  You don't want him involved in the game.
*  So if I'm the Celtics, like I'm looking at Jaylen Brown, I'm looking at Drew
*  Holliday, I'm saying, we're gonna leave you guys alone on an Island for the most
*  part.
*  Like if Luca gets 50 on you, okay.
*  You know, that's the way it's got to be, but we can't afford now more than ever
*  to send extra bodies because we, we don't want to make Al Horford defend the rim,
*  you know, all that often.
*  And I don't believe that Luke Cornett can do it.
*  So I think defending Luca one-on-one in this game three is going to be huge.
*  I noticed two things just from going to both games.
*  One is that I thought he got noticeably tired in the second halves of both games,
*  like really just kind of peeked for the first hour of the game and then held on
*  after that.
*  Cause there was a moment in game two and it seemed like he was going to go for 60
*  points.
*  Um, and the Celtics were really concerned with not letting him just get that open
*  28 footer and anytime, you know, cause you don't, you don't think he's in three
*  point range, but he always is.
*  And it's just this thing.
*  It used to be the biggest flaw with Robert Williams.
*  Remember how many times were Robert Williams?
*  He was always two feet further back than where the guy was.
*  And you knew it in real time, like, Oh, that guy's going to shoot a three over
*  Rob. He's not going to see it in time.
*  And noticing the Celtics bench a couple of times when people would forget that
*  Luke had the 28 foot range and the porzingis fell asleep on one and all the
*  coaches get mad.
*  It's like, you can tell they've just been like the whole, you know, lead up to
*  the series.
*  Don't when that guy is in this territory, 28 feet away from shooting.
*  So I thought they took those away and I thought he got tired as the game went on.
*  The bigger thing that I noticed in person, and then there was a great YouTube
*  clip today of all the times people blew by Luca in game two.
*  It's like 20 times and they're blowing by him and he kept doing the matador.
*  Like he should change his name to Luca, Luis Castillo, Dodge it.
*  Cause he was doing the matador wave by, but then trying to pick the guy from
*  behind and that just became his move.
*  But every Celtic was just going by him.
*  There were times when he was lost and wandering around.
*  I don't know how much of that had to do with him being tired, hurt, whatever.
*  But I think the Celtics are going to look at that.
*  Everyone's talking about what's going to happen on the defensive without porzingis.
*  I think there's so much meat on the bone with attacking Luca and they really were
*  figuring that out in game two.
*  They got, what'd you think of my theory?
*  I just don't understand why Tatum doesn't take 12 to 15 foot shots over and over
*  and he's just going by Luca and just not rising up the rant style.
*  He feels like he just has to keep going and get to the rim somehow and either
*  kick out or shoot a layup.
*  What's happened in his 12 foot shot?
*  Why is it gone?
*  I mean, don't you feel like that's been kind of drilled out of his game in
*  recent years in the last two years?
*  Right.
*  This is the Rossello theory about the, the Hanlonitis basically, where you
*  practice three, you practice step back threes and drives, but nothing in between.
*  I think the bigger problem with Tatum in these first two games is that he's not
*  finishing with any kind of force, right?
*  Like he looks more like the rookie and second year version of Tatum who was
*  trying to kind of artfully finish around the rim.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to see the Tatum we've seen the last couple of years, just put on 20,
*  25 pounds of muscle and try to dunk over guys, go through guys.
*  Jalen Brown does that exceptionally well.
*  Like how many times do you see Jalen Brown kind of dip around and look for layups?
*  He's going to the rim hard.
*  Like he's trying to get followed.
*  He's trying to get to the free throw line.
*  I want to see more of that from Tatum.
*  That's, that's a bigger concern for me on the subject of Donchich though.
*  Um, I, I was at all the, the Timberwolves Mavericks games.
*  I thought one of their, their fatal mistakes was that Minnesota didn't do
*  enough to put Donchich in action.
*  Right.
*  Like, I mean, they were so isolation heavy and it was like Anthony Edwards
*  going up against, you know, Derek Jones, Jr.
*  Or PJ Washington.
*  They just let Donchich hang out, defending the guy standing at the dunker spot.
*  And this is when Donchich, I got to know how severe his knee injury is, but he was
*  complaining about it at the time.
*  Like, why are you not putting him in as many actions as you possibly can?
*  And just like with Kyrie, I think Boston's done a decent job of that in this series.
*  And Donchich, look, I don't know whether it's, he doesn't care.
*  I don't know if it's because he's hurt, but he's not a good defender.
*  Like I've heard some things, you know, this year about how he's, he's playing better.
*  He's gotten like the average level.
*  I don't see it when, when he's got a guy in front of you that tries to go around.
*  Um, he's either getting beat or he's trying to do that thing.
*  Like you talked about kind of reach around and stuff you did in high school, where
*  you're trying to poke the ball away and get a steal on that end.
*  So I'd put him in as many actions as I can.
*  If for no other reason, that's going to wear him down.
*  Oh, Luke, door.
*  I got to come up with a good name for the Matador.
*  D.
*  But the thing is though, the thing is in the last couple of minutes of that game,
*  and they showed this in the other series too, he can dial it up defensively for
*  like two and a half minutes because Dallas, I thought played really, really
*  good defense down the stretch.
*  Part of that was cause the Celtics fell into that walk it up mode.
*  And, uh, you know, once things slow down, they become a lot easier to stop,
*  but they do have it in them.
*  The crowd's going to help the crowds going to give him some energy.
*  I thought, I don't know how many Luca games I've seen in person this year, but
*  I thought it was interesting.
*  He wasn't talking that much to the refs and to the crowd.
*  And I don't know whether that was because he's not feeling good.
*  I thought he was talking to the refs as much as he always does.
*  Like he talks to the refs.
*  I didn't feel like it was as much as in the, the Clippers was almost like they
*  had to have an intervention with them in that Clipper series, cause he was, it
*  was too an abstract, he was doing a one man show.
*  I submit that joke.
*  He's made a one man show on the court with the three refs.
*  Just babble, babble, babble.
*  But every time he thinks he gets fouled, he gives up on the play,
*  like completely gives up on it.
*  Like he spends the rest of that play in his, on his side of the court,
*  arguing with the referee that if I was Jason Kidd, that would drive me crazy.
*  I was thinking of Porzingis was healthy going in this game three.
*  Cause I really thought that the Celts had a chance to go up and we'll talk about
*  the reasons after the break, but I was wondering like, would this be the game
*  where Luca just tried to bomb a bunch of threes and really, really, really
*  take over and do that thing now?
*  Without Porzingis, I almost, if I'm, if I'm Dallas, I almost want to wait for that.
*  It's like the Rocky four where you want to wait for, to have the trainer go
*  no and do like the, all right, now you got to do it.
*  I want to see like who the Celtics play and what my matchups are and try
*  to save him for the second half.
*  All right.
*  So here you have the Celtics.
*  This has been an eight year odyssey, six conference finals and.
*  A really fascinating run.
*  They're the second most successful team of the last eight years, but of course
*  they didn't win a finals and coming out of the garden on Sunday, it's like,
*  that was the game played like crap.
*  25% from three.
*  We played all the hits from the typical game that they would blow even dating
*  back to the last couple of years, you know, shades of like game five, 2002
*  Milwaukee shades of some of those Miami losses shades of game four, Golden State.
*  Like we're playing the hits game two Golden State in 2022.
*  And they got through it.
*  They got over this invisible hump and now they're going to go to Dallas and
*  game three, where for whatever reason, they're more comfortable on the road.
*  I don't really fully understand it, but they play more freely, especially Tatum.
*  And I have some theories on that and they're just going to bomb threes and
*  they're actually going to blow them out in game three cause they've solved Dallas.
*  Now removing poor Zingas.
*  Are we sure we're not now under rating the fact that they still might do that?
*  That we haven't had a good Tatum yet that Tatum for whatever reason is better
*  on the road and I don't get it, but it's true.
*  And that he seems to be.
*  A mismatch for Dallas.
*  Cause he's going by everybody and they're throwing three guys at him and
*  he's still creating all these shots, but his shots not going in yet.
*  But if his shot starts going in, I don't know what their answers are.
*  Anyway, talk it out with me.
*  Is there a chance they come in and shoot the lights out?
*  You've watched them all year.
*  They've done this on the road over and over and over again.
*  I think there's a chance because like every six weeks or so they have a game
*  like they had in game two where they shoot sub 30%.
*  It looks like they're taking too many threes more often than not.
*  They lose those games and it leads to like these clouds of
*  Gary Washburn versus Joe Missoula moments at the press conference.
*  Where Gary local theater, Gary wonders why the Celtics don't drive more.
*  Joe kind of fires back at him and says that they're all good shots, but
*  oftentimes they lose those games and generally speaking, they respond
*  with more great ones, right?
*  Because they are a great three point shooting team.
*  Like what a point, one percentage point for being the number one
*  percentage team in the NBA last year.
*  So I think that's a good thing.
*  In game three, the Tatum question though is interesting because everything
*  Dallas has done, regardless of what Jason Kidd says, everything Dallas has done
*  in this series is geared towards making Tatum inefficient.
*  You know, game one, they're throwing multiple bodies at him.
*  They're tilting the floor towards him.
*  They're trying to get the ball out of his hands.
*  Then you have the whole Tatum Brown comment, which is, you know,
*  the way that they're trying to get the ball out of his hands.
*  Then you have the whole Tatum Brown comment, which is, you know, designed
*  to get into Tatum's head and look, there are people in Dallas, there are
*  people that will tell you they think it worked, right?
*  Tatum did take 22 shots in, in game two.
*  Like he did have the 12 assists and that's what everybody's talking about,
*  but he was six for 22 from the floor.
*  So people in Dallas might tell you that maybe he was overaggressive
*  like they wanted him to be.
*  But have you ever seen Bill?
*  More times where Jason Tatum was hunted defensively than game two.
*  I've never seen it before.
*  Like he was put in every action and they were trying to go one-on-one with him
*  with Luca and Kyrie every single time.
*  I'd never seen that before.
*  Now, I don't think that's a reflection on Tatum as a defensive player.
*  I think that's Dallas trying to wear down the best player on Boston and make him
*  inefficient or more inefficient on the, on the offensive end.
*  So given that, like, I don't know, it's all about how Tatum adjusts in this
*  game three to what they throw up because they're going to have something new.
*  It will be something that he hasn't seen before or something they haven't done yet.
*  That's going to try to throw him off the mark.
*  If he adjusts well and shoots like six for 10 from three, which is very possible.
*  There's your Jason Tatum breakout game.
*  There's your game six against Milwaukee from 2022 game seven against Philadelphia.
*  But everything Dallas is doing in this series is, is, is geared towards making
*  Tatum inefficient so far, at least shooting wise, they have been successful.
*  Well, I agree.
*  I agree with everything you just said.
*  I also think Boston can learn from some of those stuff that didn't work too.
*  Cause even just sitting there in game too, one of the things my dad and I noticed
*  was when Tatum was on the left side, about 30 feet back with, with facing the dude,
*  a lot of times the Celts make the mistake of they have them facing the guy either
*  straight ahead.
*  So the rim straight ahead of him or he's on the right.
*  And if he's on the right, he's not as good going to his left.
*  He wants to go to his right.
*  He wants to finish.
*  He has that great Dr.
*  J little swoop layup.
*  And when he's on the left with some speed, he was just going by Luca, getting into
*  the paint on his dominant hand.
*  And then it's either a jump hook or it's like that scoop layup.
*  And I'm wondering if they're going to shift where he has the ball in the spots for
*  game three.
*  And they, and I would encourage people in the first half, like look, look where he's
*  getting the ball at these spots.
*  Cause it was the same kind of looks.
*  Are they going to shift people around so that he's attacking kind of 45 degree
*  diagonal with his right hand?
*  Maybe that'll help them.
*  Cause I thought strategically some of the ways they were using Tatum, I didn't
*  make sense to me, you know, if he doesn't have his three point shot and he's
*  attacking straight ahead, then everybody can come over and help.
*  Right?
*  That's why drew is open on those little, those little passes sometimes, but it
*  wasn't helping him kind of get unlocked.
*  So they got to unlock him.
*  Um, the other thing is the more Horford plays, if Horford's hitting threes, that's
*  eventually going to just open up more space for him in the middle, right?
*  Whereas poor Zingas, he was at the top.
*  So if he's at the top now, Tatum has to be at a little bit of a weird angle.
*  I don't know.
*  I know I'm babbling, but I just feel like they're going to put them in better
*  spots than he was in the last game.
*  Well, two things.
*  One, I mean, I thought holiday bailed Tatum out big time in game two.
*  What was like six of his 12 assists went to holiday and that's because holiday.
*  He's smart cuts.
*  So smart.
*  Like just doing stuff you learn in high school, like follow the basketball,
*  like get, get in the paint, step into open space, make yourself available.
*  This is all basketball one-on-one that, you know, guys learn when they're kids.
*  And I thought, you know, there were a couple of times during that game that
*  Tatum found himself kind of in no man's land and holiday bailed him out.
*  There were a couple of times too.
*  I was sitting next to some of the reporters on press row.
*  Very generous with the assists.
*  I thought some of the, uh, stackkeepers on that one, there were at least, uh,
*  there were at least two, three dribble assists.
*  12 did feel a little high.
*  I will say it.
*  Did that feel like a 12 assist or there are a few of them in that game.
*  My question with where you put Tatum is what happened to the post-ups?
*  Like this is what we saw.
*  Yeah.
*  Like where is that gone?
*  Like that was a big part of Tatum's offensive game all season.
*  Like, is it something they're seeing in Dallas that, that it doesn't make sense?
*  Like, is it cause Washington is a stronger player, but we heard all year long
*  that Tatum had developed into a much better mid to low post player.
*  And especially as a passer, like he was really good at passing out of those positions.
*  I mean, I think if you're going to make an adjustment with him, you know, give
*  him a little bit of diversity, don't, don't force him to make decisions off the
*  dribble quite as often, let him put his shoulder down, get to the basket, get
*  to the, uh, the foul line.
*  This guy's capable of going to the foul line 10 times a game.
*  We've seen that during the regular season, just give him a chance to get easier
*  looks than just these dribble drives where he's walking into three different
*  defenders, use them as a screener, post them up on the foul line, put him 30
*  feet on the left.
*  So he has a running start going to his hand.
*  It's all stuff.
*  I mean, he had no shots at the foul line in game two.
*  He had no shots basically from eight to 15 feet.
*  We took 22 shots and one foul on jumper.
*  Like that's crazy to me.
*  They're using them wrong.
*  Um, and then the other piece is I do feel like they were attacking Kyrie a lot.
*  I feel like they could do that even more and put some miles on him.
*  They have two guards that are really good at using screens, attacking the
*  basket and kicking out and, um, they can leverage that.
*  And Jalen, I think who he wasn't as good in game two as he was in game one, but
*  has really been, and he had a bunch of turnovers, but has been really smart
*  about I'm going to attack, I'm going to get in the paint, I'm going to attack,
*  I'm going to get in the paint.
*  And, um, so that mentality was there.
*  I just didn't think they shot well.
*  And you know, the Hauser piece of it, just, which is wide open shots that it felt
*  like they could have been up by 18 at any time.
*  So you're sitting with all the seat mates.
*  Who's like, who's like the winning lottery ticket when you're at these big games?
*  Is there anybody that's just like great to sit next to that just is just spouting
*  wisdom the whole time?
*  Is there an MVP?
*  That person doesn't exist.
*  Uh, I don't think that person exists.
*  I get stuck next to Jay King for these games, uh, who is the worst dressed
*  member of media that I've ever seen.
*  Like he rolls in, like he just played 18 minutes at the Y, uh, for every game.
*  So there's that part of it.
*  But, uh, I, sitting next to the, the Boston media cartel is fun sitting right
*  behind Christian Megliola during these games is fun.
*  Telling everybody to calm down about Tatum.
*  Um, that Tatum game is funny because from a national perspective, I think people
*  were surprised that a lot of people, including me, like we're in Rossello,
*  we're talking about like the Tatum.
*  That was weird Tatum game.
*  Why, why are you even talking about that?
*  You're up to nothing.
*  And then on the local level, it's the complete opposite where that's probably all
*  they were talking about for the next 24 hours is poor Zingas really hurt.
*  And what's wrong with Tatum?
*  The, it just never leaves the DNA in, in, in Boston.
*  Just doesn't cause there were other really fun storylines to talk about,
*  like the drew holiday, how magnificent he's been, what an amazing trade that was.
*  Like he could go run the gamut, but I think it's cause Tatum has been in our
*  lives now really since that draft, since the flip back and then just was
*  immediately on a big stage from the get-go and now we have the seven
*  year reservoir of experience.
*  I was telling somebody, I don't remember anything like this with the, with
*  people murmuring when they don't like what they're seeing from Tatum as the
*  place happening with another Boston player.
*  Like you would see it sometimes in baseball with a pitcher.
*  Like if, you know, the pitchers throws two balls and it's certain pitchers and
*  you could kind of hear murmuring in the crowd, like, Oh God, like this would
*  happen with Derek Lowe in the early 2000s.
*  I don't know.
*  Oh God.
*  I used to call it the Derek Lowe face.
*  It was like, Oh God, he's making the Derek Lowe face.
*  So no, but you could feel it in the stands, right?
*  Like that was a real, I wasn't crazy.
*  Like you could, there's like murmuring sometimes where it's like, Oh God,
*  seven seconds left in the shot clock and Tatum's got the ball 35 feet from the
*  basket.
*  This is just such a bizarre relationship because on paper he's everything you
*  would ever want from a star.
*  And I love Tatum by the way, but it's just weird.
*  The push and pull of this whole thing has been nuts to watch.
*  Well, the conversation in Boston about Tatum is it's built around like, is he,
*  you know, he's finished sixth in the MVP voting.
*  Is he a top six player in the NBA?
*  You know, is he capable of doing like what we've seen Jokic do in the playoffs?
*  What we've seen or just recently saw Jalen Brunson do in the playoffs.
*  The problem with Tatum is that, I mean, it's not that Boston has so much talent,
*  but he's not been asked to do the things that some of these other players have
*  been asked to do.
*  So there's the question of like, whether or not he's on that level, regardless of
*  the stats he puts up, which validate that, which prove that out that he is on that
*  level.
*  That's what the conversation is like in Boston when it comes to Jason Tatum.
*  Is he the guy on this team?
*  And look, all the stuff we've talked about, the six conference finals, now two
*  NBA finals, right now, when it comes to Tatum, it's almost being used as a
*  negative.
*  If they win this series, and I think ultimately Tatum's gonna have a big part
*  in it. I mean, he's already played a big role, but if they get to four wins, he's
*  gonna have a massive scoring night in one of them.
*  I'm convinced of that.
*  If that happens, all of a sudden, all the stuff we're criticizing him for becomes
*  part of a more positive narrative.
*  It's like, well, he won one championship and he went to six conference finals and
*  two NBA finals.
*  So once you get that championship, all the times you came up short go from being
*  negatives to part of a positive story, if that makes sense.
*  Yeah, it's also a fundamental misunderstanding of why this team was so
*  special.
*  Like when the 2004 Pistons were ripping off wins and ended up just killing the
*  Lakers in the finals, nobody was like, who's the alpha on this team?
*  Is it Rip Hamilton or Chauncey Billups?
*  It's almost like a fault of how we talk about basketball now.
*  I think one of the great things about this Celtics team, and one of the reasons
*  I thought they're going to win the series is they can win games when Tatum
*  isn't good.
*  They can win games when Brown isn't good.
*  And it's great with Porzingis.
*  They could win games when Tatum and Brown weren't good.
*  You know, as long as those guys were out there and doing a bunch of different
*  stuff, they could still kind of patch wins together.
*  And that was what made them crazy.
*  The Mavericks, especially this series, cannot win if Luca plays badly.
*  And they probably can't win in Boston if Kyrie plays badly and Luca's like, fine,
*  not great, right?
*  There's, there's limits with both those guys.
*  They just can't replace the offense.
*  They scored 89 and 98 in those two games.
*  They just can't put the points together.
*  The Celtics can.
*  And they can have these random games where they'll just hit 22 threes and maybe
*  Tatum has one of them.
*  You know?
*  So I, so when I hear that stuff about, well, can he be the guy in a title team?
*  It's like, well, they built a really good team.
*  Like maybe that should be the topic.
*  Like they, you know, they, they have more depth at a high level than any
*  teams in a while, right?
*  You're probably going back to the mid 2010 Warriors.
*  And if you're making a list of the top 60 players in the league, they have five of
*  them and they might even have five of the top, you know, 45 or 50.
*  So that's why I think the Tatum thing is kind of silly.
*  It's like, yeah, could it be Jokic?
*  Probably not.
*  Jokic is one of the top 20 players of all time already.
*  But I said to Rossello on Sunday night, what's your take on this?
*  I felt like Tatum's not a finished product yet.
*  And I still think there's more work to do, especially with shot selection.
*  And I mentioned that little, that jumper eight to 15 feet.
*  And I think Rossello was more on the side of he's 26.
*  He's played in over a hundred playoff games.
*  This is kind of who he is.
*  Do you think this is who he is or is there another level?
*  I think he's 90% of the way there.
*  Um, you know, I think that's a good percentage.
*  You know, I love percentages.
*  Yeah.
*  You've got a little bit of wiggle room to grow.
*  I mean, we've seen that grow.
*  You want to go 89%?
*  We'll go 89%.
*  What about 90.3%?
*  Oh, 50, 40, 90.
*  One of those.
*  Uh, we've seen growth the last couple of years.
*  We talked about, we talked about the post game like that early on.
*  That was not part of his repertoire.
*  He wasn't a post player.
*  He wasn't a very good passer out of the post.
*  He became both those things this season.
*  So I think there's room to grow the, the mid range stuff though.
*  It goes back to what we were talking about.
*  Like, you know, Tatum is a Kobe acolyte, right?
*  Like Tatum came up loving the mid range game.
*  He loved coming off screens and shooting the, the 18 footer.
*  They, they kind of beat, remember, do you remember they went to the
*  conference finals that first year?
*  And that was the year that, that, that details came out on Tatum.
*  Went the Kobe series on ESPN plus where Tatum watched that like a dozen times.
*  He was just obsessed with Kobe's insight into his game.
*  So he wanted to be like Kobe and Kobe was, you know, for most part
*  a mid range jump shooter.
*  Um, but over time, the Celtics during the season, Drew Hanlon in the off season,
*  they, they drilled that out of them.
*  They made him three pointers or, you know, gave the basket.
*  I think, I don't think you can expect that part of his game to come back
*  because nobody wants it to come back.
*  I mean, we might, but nobody internally in Boston wants it to come back.
*  And certainly in the off season, they're not really working on it.
*  Where I think the next 10% is finishing.
*  You're like, and again, it's what we discussed discussed.
*  When I see Tatum dipsy do around the lane and not using that six foot nine, 240
*  plus pound pound frame, the way he should, it's maddening.
*  And that's, that's the next step when he starts finishing over guys and through
*  guys and not worrying about, you know, using an angle off the backboard.
*  If he starts doing that, he's a going to score more and B going to get
*  to the free throw line a lot more.
*  So that's where the 10% I think comes in with Jason Tatum.
*  You know what?
*  I'm dropping that to 85% because we each had our own things that we
*  thought he could get better at.
*  So maybe that maybe that's our answer.
*  I agree with what you said, but I also think I'm right too, because as you
*  pointed out, he used to be really good from 14, 18 feet and they've thrown this
*  away and yet you watch like some of the baskets Jalen got, especially in the
*  first game where the kind of shots Tatum doesn't take Jalen was getting those
*  like little eight footers, those little push shots are like, okay, I'm fine.
*  I'll take this little 12 footer here.
*  And Tatum just doesn't seem interested in that.
*  So that's how I feel.
*  They can get better.
*  I mean, I look at Jalen Brown, people thought that guy was a finished product.
*  Right.
*  I think we thought maybe he could dribble better, but what did he do?
*  He got stronger.
*  Um, he got way more aggro.
*  He really committed to the defensive end in a totally different way.
*  And I thought he was a good defensive player before, but something is different.
*  Like he, he takes that and he is pissed.
*  He didn't make all defense.
*  I don't know if he was that great, but if we voted for all defense with six
*  guards, six forwards and three centers, he might've had a chance to be one of
*  the six forwards, you know, but I think he's better than he was last year.
*  And he's a year older than Tatum, which makes me think there might be hope for
*  Tatum, uh, one guy who's not going to be.
*  Probably much better, but I think it's getting better from the IQ point.
*  Those drew Drew is like those guys.
*  I remember when I hit this point and pick up basketball before my body parts
*  started to go one at a time when you're just smarter than everyone you're playing.
*  And it's like, all right, all these guys, but I know exactly what I can do and
*  can't do and what spots to go to.
*  And you just, everything kind of slows down a little bit and you've been in so
*  many games and watched so many games.
*  You're just like, Oh, he's going to do that.
*  So the rebound is going to come here and things click in a different way.
*  And that, that was what I thought drew is becoming like the old guy in the pickup
*  game in some spots where, you know, he's like, Oh, Tatum's going to take that shot.
*  The rebound is going to go right here.
*  I'm going to get it.
*  He gets 11 rebounds.
*  He's six, he's six, three.
*  And then the other thing is anytime they wanted somebody to stop scoring,
*  where did they go?
*  It was true.
*  So I think drew has a real chance to be finals MVP.
*  It's weird is plus seven 50 still.
*  That's I don't really understand.
*  Don't you think I'd be, if you had to vote after two games, who would you have voted for?
*  I would have voted for holiday.
*  I think he's had two, two elite defensive games and one great offensive game.
*  Whereas Jalen had one complete game and then one good game in game two.
*  I think I would, I would edge holiday in that one.
*  What thing I love most about Drew's defense is that not only can he anticipate
*  where a guy is going to go, but when he anticipates, he sells out completely.
*  Like, you know, that Nemhar steal he had at the end of game four, he
*  anticipated him going right.
*  And he didn't just hedge over there like, or take a half a step.
*  He went all the way over and forced Nemhar to effectively come into him.
*  And what I watched in this series against Dallas, he knows Kyrie wants to go right.
*  So he is putting his entire body between the right side and Kyrie Irving.
*  And if Kyrie wants to pivot around and go left, yeah, he might have been
*  in an opening there for a minute or two while Boston adjusts, but he's just
*  not going to let him go right.
*  He's going to form that wall right in front of him on that right side.
*  And I love that because sometimes you see guys, you know, gamble a little bit,
*  step out, you know, do a little bit of, of hedging, not Drew Holliday.
*  He is, he is all in on, on, on these, these anticipation moves and like
*  90% of the time they pay off.
*  One of my favorite players, future Hall of Famer.
*  Um, winning player.
*  I love that he's on team USA.
*  It's like the exact type of guy who should be on team USA every four years.
*  Right.
*  Are you ready?
*  I asked my dad on Thursday's pod.
*  I was like, let's retire second row Joe.
*  It's over.
*  He's now first row Joe.
*  He's doing a good job.
*  He's got the winningest record of any coach after two years in the history of
*  the sport.
*  The Celtics are there were seven and 70, 77 and 20, we taped it another 70 and 20.
*  I think it's been night and day him last year versus this year.
*  The S a lot of the stubbornness has gone with him.
*  Um, there's he'll take, he has a sense of the flow of the game now and he'll
*  actually, he'll realize the game's drifting a certain way and he'll actually call
*  timeouts, which he just never did last year.
*  Um, I just think he's way better.
*  He's been better dealing with the media except for his foil, Gary Washburn,
*  which I'm sure will be a seven part 30 for 30, but having assistance, I think
*  has really helped him.
*  I mean, he lucked out with Charles Lee, who everybody loves, but the
*  assistant coaching side's better.
*  What else are you seeing from covering the team with him?
*  What's different?
*  A more relaxed version of him.
*  And that's hard for people to see because publicly he just kind of
*  comes off very different, right?
*  He's a different guy.
*  You know, how many coaches defend three pointers after timeouts?
*  Like, I mean, there's, there's just a general oddness to him.
*  That's, that's not going to change, change, but he's much more comfortable in his
*  own skin this year than he was last year, which is completely understandable.
*  I mean, sometimes we, we don't, we don't give enough credit to what
*  he had to go through last year.
*  He was a back bench guy about to get a promotion.
*  Then three days before his boss leaves in a sex scandal, like, and then
*  he's, you mentioned the assistance.
*  He's got a bunch of assistants around them.
*  Probably half of them thought they deserve the job, right?
*  Like all those guys go at the end of last season, you bring in guys
*  that are comfortable in their roles.
*  You mentioned Charles, he's been great.
*  Uh, I think, I think Jeff Van Gundy is a strong candidate to take that
*  role next year, uh, with the team.
*  Uh, and Sam Cassell, who if Sam Cassell doesn't get a job at some point, I don't,
*  there's something wrong with, with the NBA because that guy's paid his dues.
*  He's a really smart basketball guy.
*  He has a great connection with players.
*  Uh, he has been exactly what this team has needed as that, that
*  second assistant, uh, on the bench.
*  So I think all those, those, those are factors in Joe being better as a coach,
*  a natural evolution, which for 30 something year old is, is
*  inevitably going to come.
*  And then having, you know, guys around you that want to be there, that want to
*  help you succeed as opposed to maybe kind of begrudgingly being there on the bench.
*  Yeah.
*  Which we've seen that a few times with basketball, when somebody takes over
*  mid season, he always gets a little dicey with the assistance.
*  I still wonder if they got swept by Miami last year, if he would have gone fired.
*  Uh, so the only, I don't think that they would have fired him and hired somebody
*  else, I think if they got swept last year, what Grossbeck probably
*  would have looked at Brad Stevens said, you fix this, you know, this
*  didn't cause the email, you don't come mess, but, um, we elevate your guy, Joe
*  Missoula, uh, we failed to live up to expectations if they got swept by Miami.
*  Uh, you've got to go down.
*  Look, I remember asking Brad after the UDOKA stuff went down, like, did
*  he consider taking the job?
*  And he said, no, but then WIC came on and was like, yeah, we had that,
*  we had that conversation.
*  It was a short one, but we had that conversation.
*  My guess is that it would have been a Brad Stevens problem that he would have
*  made Brad take over and, and try to clean up, you know, the mess that was there.
*  That would have been a tough story.
*  I mean, it's weird, but the game for Miami, when it just felt like that
*  entire team was going to roll over, the coach was going to get fired and the
*  team might be blown up.
*  And then what do you do with Jalen Brown?
*  And there were 19 different things that come out of that.
*  And then they just played really well for three games, for two games in a row.
*  Then white hits the miracle put back.
*  Now we're going to a game seven and at least that saved some stuff and gave
*  some levity and perspective to, all right, how should we actually approach this?
*  Okay.
*  Jalen, you're getting paid now.
*  And I just, I really wonder what happens if they just get, if they roll over
*  in game four in Miami, I don't know what happens and I don't even know if J.
*  I honestly don't know if Jalen's on the team.
*  Like, I don't know how much they would have blown it up.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if they would have blown it up.
*  I think a coaching change would have been possible because if you're getting
*  swept by granted Miami is one of the best eight seeds you'll, you'll ever see.
*  But if you get swept, uh, I think a coaching change was certainly, but it
*  would have been off a game three, which was so dispiriting.
*  And then you think game four should have been just as dispiriting if you get
*  swept and then now you got to look at the mirror and go, all right.
*  I mean, my thing never changed.
*  I'm not, I don't want to break up Tatum and Brown.
*  I never want to break those guys up.
*  But when it's bad and you're angry and you're mad and you haven't won in a few
*  years, that's when weird shit starts happening, you know, so maybe the
*  coach would have been, but even trading.
*  I mean, you have funny.
*  Does the Marcus stuff seem now when they traded Marcus, like how many people
*  texted you like, why would they trade that guy?
*  He's the heart and soul of the team.
*  How crazy does that seem now?
*  It seems completely nuts.
*  I think you have to factor in that he was traded before they knew they had holiday.
*  Right?
*  Like he was part of that, that poor Zingas deal.
*  So at the time I was looking around going, well, who's going to be the point
*  guard of this team?
*  Like, do they have, is Derek White going to be able to do it?
*  Do they have enough depth at that spot?
*  Um, so it definitely raised a lot of eyebrows across the league.
*  I mean, not, not that, not that they thought there couldn't be an upgrade for
*  Marcus, but you were doing a deal that didn't net you Tias Jones too, right?
*  He didn't have a built in and replacement there.
*  So I think in that sense, it did raise it.
*  And I would say one thing, the, you mentioned that Derek White shot.
*  I'll always remember it because, you know, we all have stories that wind up in the,
*  the saved folder forever.
*  Like after Derek White made that shot, I managed to get Dave Roberts on the
*  phone, like the next morning, I was going to write a story about like, you know,
*  cause you know, Dave stole second base.
*  He's known for that in Boston forever.
*  Like he is, he could buy, you know, he could do no wrong in Boston, regardless
*  of what happens in LA, like Derek White.
*  Was about to become that guy.
*  If they had one game seven, Derek White would have become that guy and had the
*  whole story written ready to go.
*  If they won game seven and they lay that egg in game seven, that, uh, and
*  that would be a good website.
*  Stories, stories I wrote that I had to just put in the junk mail.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember, I remember writing a couple, like two thirds, three fourths of a
*  column and then a game shifting and just like, okay, toss that, toss that
*  into the woodchopper.
*  Um, so state of panic in Boston with the KP news, with these, these parts of the
*  body that I don't even know how to pronounce.
*  We went from a one out of 10 panic to, I would say probably like an 8.5, but that
*  could ratchet up if they lose game three.
*  Um, Luke Cornett, you're on Luke Cornett watch.
*  I need Luke Cornett to have a positive plus minus in, in game three.
*  If he has a positive plus minus, I think they win.
*  If he's like minus six, I think they lose.
*  So if he's Sheldon Williams in whatever 2010 finals game that was, what was he?
*  Like a minus 11 in three minutes.
*  It's still like the record for worst half I've ever seen in person by anyone in a
*  big game.
*  Um, and then.
*  You know, maybe this'll be, maybe this'll be the Tatum quiet down game.
