# Why Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs Are a Real Threat | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHgiPf29R44)
*  a team that I think we all felt was going to be a playoff team was going to be a fringe contender.
*  I think the Rover under maybe was 46 and a half somewhere in that range.
*  So it was right in the ballpark of Toronto and teams like that.
*  And maybe had the upside if it gelled with the guards.
*  We didn't expect Rob.
*  Mitchell comes in, this is the best he's ever looked.
*  Unreal.
*  This is scratching, not only scratching the ceiling, punching his fist through the ceiling.
*  And then last night in a really, really, really fascinating game against the Celtics,
*  him and Garland just looked really good together.
*  Garland's out 13 minutes into the opening night.
*  This is the first time they got to play together.
*  They get thrown into the fire.
*  Celtics lost them a few nights ago.
*  They want revenge.
*  And it just the way it looked.
*  I'm trying not to overreact, but it's one of the best teams I've watched this year.
*  And I don't think that's an overreaction.
*  I mean, if you're trying not to overreact, I fear you've invited the wrong person on this podcast
*  because they've been such a feel good story.
*  I'm having a hard time talking myself out of the fact that they look like
*  the second best team in the East.
*  Like to me, it's Milwaukee and it's Cleveland.
*  And then everyone else is trying to figure their stuff out.
*  But Cleveland is a young team that, as you mentioned, like so many different guys
*  are kind of still figuring out what they can be.
*  And yet they still look so much better than pretty much everybody else in the conference right now.
*  Boston threw different lineups at them last night.
*  I thought Boston played really hard.
*  I would put, I would slightly disagree.
*  I think it's Milwaukee and then I think it's Cleveland, Boston, Boston, Cleveland, whatever order.
*  I think it's going to be those two.
*  And then I think, I really do think it drops after that.
*  But last night, Boston's like, all right, we'll play Grant Williams with Horford.
*  No, actually we're going to go small.
*  We're being brogged in.
*  Can you handle this?
*  And Cleveland was able to navigate everything.
*  Mitchell's playing with so much confidence.
*  Oh my God.
*  This was the rub of the trade last year, right?
*  It's like, what Mitchell am I getting?
*  Am I getting the guy that I just watched completely milled in on defense in the playoffs
*  and it's been nursing some injuries, didn't seem that happy.
*  Or am I getting the guy who went toe to toe with Denver in those playoffs series?
*  What, what am I getting?
*  I was in the camp.
*  This is somebody who has at least proven if you need to go mano a mano in a playoff game
*  and a game seven and a game four on the road, whatever, he's not going to be afraid.
*  And he can kind of carry you.
*  He's been better than that.
*  He's been an absolute bad-ass and he's given them like a starring presence that
*  I'm not sure the Cavs have ever had outside LeBron, to be honest with you.
*  And certainly not recently.
*  Like they've had guys who are good.
*  They have a good scores, good creators, but the combination of presence and poise
*  and on-court leadership and just like effort making huge plays that very few players can make.
*  And I think what's heartening about that, to your point about the defense and the fact that
*  he did really mail it in at times for Utah, not just last year or the last couple of years,
*  we saw him in these games against the Celtics, tough overtime games,
*  come up with huge rebounds, come up with huge stops, like show some of what made him such
*  an intriguing prospect from the start.
*  They'll like do it all all around game.
*  Not just the guy who can go get you a bucket and who can pull up for threes,
*  but he can do all this stuff.
*  And if that's the player that Cleveland's getting, I mean, it puts them in a totally
*  different class because we're just seeing, as you mentioned with Garland, like their best lineup
*  has barely had a chance to play together and they've already looked this good.
*  What are they going to look like 50 games from now when Garland and Mitchell are fully
*  synergized with everyone knows exactly where to be and how to move because the ball movement
*  is amazing.
*  The effort level is super high with the Cavs right now.
*  They look like a contending team.
*  They look like a team that's going to be able to push pretty much anyone else in the East.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't think it's an overreaction.
*  There's two types of overreactions coming out of the first three weeks, I would say.
*  One is, oh, that team is better than I thought, than we all thought that was going to be.
*  I think like the Bulls last year were a good example where the Bulls came to Rosen look great.
*  And we were like, oh, let's recalibrate our expectations here.
*  Then sometimes you get the team that it's pretty clear this team's going to be a problem.
*  And that's just the way it is.
*  I don't think there's anything fluky about this team.
*  I love all the shots they get and they always have the backbone of Allen and Mobley where
*  they're always going to have rim protection.
*  They're always going to have rebounding and those guys are fun to play with.
*  You don't have to run the ceremonial post-ups for either of them.
*  Mobley's stats are down.
*  Like Mobley's is like 16 and six, two assists.
*  Like for usually second year guys jump, but it's fine when you actually watch him.
*  And I've watched a lot of the Cavs this year and you watch him and it's not like he's getting
*  left out.
*  He's not frozen out.
*  He's involved and he'll make big plays.
*  He'll have follow ups.
*  They'll run some stuff through him occasionally, but really more for his passing.
*  But the Mitchell Garland thing was the, that was the X factor to me.
*  What is this going to look like?
*  Is Garland going to be cool with this?
*  And we did the over under pod and we were talking about Garland for the assist title.
*  Like, cause I think he's, I actually think he's more of a point guard than maybe he got
*  credit for it because he had to do so much last year.
*  And Rosillo said the same thing where he kind of had to score more than maybe you wanted
*  to because they didn't really have in their options.
*  Now, last night you saw him as a real point guard who could then also create his own offense.
*  I think those guys are going to be great together.
*  I really do.
*  Like I, I don't have a lot of doubts.
*  Does it sound like you do either?
*  No.
*  And Garland is a guy who wants to give the ball up.
*  Like he wants to share with Mitchell and get moving off the ball and create shots that
*  way too.
*  And he's really good at it.
*  And we saw in these games against the Celtics in particular, I mean, these are high level
*  defenders.
*  These are guys who just came off a run to the NBA finals and he's toying with them.
*  Like he's setting guys up to get lobs to Jared Allen, to get feeds inside to every
*  mobile, to kick out to shooters.
*  His control and feel for those situations, I think is probably disproportionately high
*  relative to like what the awareness of Darius Garland as a playmaker is league wide.
*  Like he, this is one of the most impressive young point guards in the league right now.
*  One of the like a burgeoning playmaker in every sense.
*  What we don't know is like when it really comes down to it, how are teams going to try
*  to attack him and Mitchell defensively?
*  Like how are they going to try to exploit that lack of size?
*  And we're probably not going to know that until the first round of the playoffs, maybe
*  the second round of the playoffs.
*  Like that's just not the kind of thing that happens in the regular season at that level
*  between then and now.
*  I think there's a lot that the Cavs can still work out and still get better at and still
*  improve at, which is a scary place when you're already starting from a point that's this
*  good.
*  They're sixth in offense and sixth in defense.
*  They're one of three teams with double digit point differential.
*  Listen, if Mitchell's going to play as hard as he's played the first seven games,
*  I'm not as worried about as I was before the season because he really gave a shit.
*  And it was funny.
*  I thought I was talking to my, I was talking to one of my friends about it is Celtics fan.
*  And I was like, the thing that alarmed me about the game yesterday was I really felt
*  like the Celtics tried.
*  Like I actually felt like that was their A game.
*  I thought Tatum, especially in the fourth quarter and OT was like balls to the wall.
*  And he had some brilliant stuff.
*  Slow start, but I thought near the end, same thing for Jalen Brown.
*  And on paper, they have the best back court of defenders and wings to throw at those two
*  guards.
*  And yet those guards were getting where they wanted to get to.
*  And they were getting good shots.
*  And that was like every team has their kryptonite team.
*  I do worry.
*  Like with this matchup, like we saw two close games in a row where Mitchell was able to
*  navigate and get shots and situations that he liked on Friday night and then tonight.
*  And I don't, I don't think that's an awesome sign for the Celtics because this is supposed
*  to be their strength, right?
*  Defending scoring guards.
*  And you look at the other side of it, like this, the Cavs had lots of chances where they
*  were trying to feed Jared Allen inside against like a smaller guard or something.
*  And they couldn't quite get it worked out.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the kind of stuff that looks a lot better in March and April a lot of times when
*  you have, when you have a lot of more experience in terms of what those angles look like.
*  I think to your point about Jalen Brown and Jason Tatum, I thought they both played really
*  effective games overall, really high level stuff from them.
*  And yet Evan Mobley is guarding Jalen Brown for a lot of this game.
*  And I thought he had some unbelievable defensive plays and some defensive plays on the weak side
*  that you look at it and it's like, tell me this is not the shadow of Kevin Garnett
*  straddling two players at once guarding everybody on the weak side, cutting off everything.
*  And I know how ridiculous that sounds, but Evan Mobley is the kind of player who makes
*  you say ridiculous shit.
*  Like he has that kind of defensive potential.
*  And again, that's where you're starting from.
*  That's where we are now on November 3rd.
*  Like there's just so much more room for this team to grow, especially relative to
*  teams like Miami, teams like Philadelphia.
*  We just found out James Harden is going to miss a month of basketball.
*  And so they're not even going to be able to start figuring out their issues until he really gets
*  back. It's starting to feel more and more like this is not an early trend with the Cavs.
*  Like this is just the state of affairs.
*  This is a team that's going to be in that mix in the top tiers of the conference right now.
