# Bill’s Top 25 NBA Players RIGHT NOW  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ_321f3-Ys)
*  Okay, so we have to turn in ringer 100 and I just wanted to go over the top 25
*  with you and then we'll go
*  This is what I have I sent it to you in advance
*  And I like I like this list we take this list seriously. It's not like the ESPN list
*  We actually like put real thought into the rankings
*  So I have yokage one Donchich two and Janice three
*  We're good at this point, right? Yeah. Yes. Yes
*  SGA for
*  Yeah, so good still good Tatum has to be five
*  I don't care what happened in the Olympics the shit that that guy does do night to night as
*  A point forward in that team his defensive stuff is rebounding the fact that he's the anchor of a team that won the title
*  And is a 65
*  66 win team potentially. I don't know how he's not fifth. I
*  Don't I'm not arguing with you. It's fine curry six
*  Sure
*  Durant seventh
*  So here's the thing that I just want to make sure that we we talked through having both those guys ahead of Anthony Edwards
*  Yeah, who is I I think still even with the you know, the slowish start for Minnesota
*  Isn't he still the best two-way player in the game?
*  Yeah, him and the honest right so I have Edwards eighth
*  I have Jalen Branson ninth and I have Anthony Davis tenth and Edwards was the hardest one to figure out
*  But I think to me it comes down to
*  Durant and curry have the resume
*  That Edwards is still building and I just wasn't ready to have him jump those guys yet. You know, what's funny is
*  And I'm not accusing you of this but in my mind's eye having just watched the Olympics and watching
*  Them be the big brothers to him
*  He was the little brother on that team and his his role was vital his contribution was was tremendous
*  But watching those two guys when it was night nighttime
*  It was you know, curry, especially
*  I'm not the legacy of it. I'm not gonna quibble. I'm not gonna quibble
*  Jalen Branson nine Davis ten. I thought what was interesting about this part of the exercise
*  That's clearly the top ten. Yes, and you could quibble about oh should could Tatum be
*  Switch with Durant you could go through and you could fight me on any of that side. Yeah
*  I think that has to be the top ten. I'd like I have Mitchell 11 and Booker 12
*  And I don't think they they're sniffing that top ten
*  Not not on my list. I
*  Like both of them. They're not in the top ten
*  All right, I had Palo 13
*  All right, I had Palo 13 I have Jalen 14 and I have LeBron 15, okay
*  and incredible
*  Jalen versus Palo Palo, I'm not gonna ding him because he's hurt. He got an injury. He'll be back
*  He'll be fine. But I just think for what we were watching him do with Orlando
*  It's a tiny step higher than what Jalen can do
*  But Jalen has to be a top 15 guy for me at this point. He's in finals MVP. I would say so. Yeah
*  Then in LeBron, it's like year 22
*  It's the it's the best. He's the coolest
*  Yeah, I don't you could you could tell me he should be five spots lower. Nah
*  It seems right 15 seems right for him because he could still do what he did last night
*  He put up 39. I want to say it respectfully
*  But the guys like right behind him in this list, I put a bitch ass
*  I'm I won't say any names ahead of LeBron. Come on
*  So I have this is another interesting cluster 16 17 18 Wemba Nyama sub bonus at a bio
*  And one Bini Amo because of the defense and all these on-off stats with just how destructive he is defensively
*  Subbonus I think has to be in the top 20 for what he's doing night tonight
*  I'd a bio is the one where I was like almost ready to shove him out of the top 20
*  I know good this year. I have a try to get our time with the doubt, right?
*  Well cuz he's earned it and because his defensive metrics remain
*  I mean, I don't know what they are through these first seven or eight games
*  but like the underrated quiet part of his game how he
*  Inflicts his will on games. It doesn't show through box score wise
*  It doesn't even really show through when you're sitting and watching except for that. He tilts the floor defensively for them
*  That's how they end up winning mid 40s
*  I don't know man who you like the names you have behind him don't deserve to be ahead of him in my humble opinion
*  I have towns six spots behind him and he kicked his ass last week, you know, okay, I'll keep him at 18
*  Okay, but then I have a bunch of guards Fox 19 John Moran 20
*  Maxi 21 and Kyrie 22
*  I think Kyrie has been a professional now for two years and you know
*  He's 23 to 26 a game and makes 40% of his threes and you could go to it in the games
*  I I got a hand at home
*  The one that I think is going to make a leap and make us really
*  Work hard is Tyrese whenever he comes back from this hamstring injury because he is sick
*  What what I mean speaking of guys with two-way potential
*  Yeah, you put maxi Moran Fox and that's a nice little battle for out of those three guys who would you rather have?
*  Jalen Williams at 23
*  Carl Anthony towns up to 24. I've been really impressed with him on the next
*  On the one hand it shouldn't surprise us that it's working
*  except for on the other hand
*  But you know the revelation has been it's not a revelation because we've seen him do it but
*  He's kind of this is the position
*  He should be is a stretch five on a team like this not playing Rudy go bare even though the Rudy go bare thing
*  worked and they almost made the finals, but
*  I just I love what I've seen with him in Brunson
*  Yeah, well, that's the you got to the Brunson part the Brunson part is the part to say out loud
*  Yeah, cuz he's playing with the top three point guard point guard real point guard
*  I
*  Think he's a top 25 guy though
*  I mean, you're not gonna hear me argue to the contrary
*  He came out on fire with a commitment to the defensive end
*  That was the project for the summer when they when they when they broke, you know
*  It's like shit. Here's what we want you to do this summer a keep eating go to go to Arby's once a week
*  Keep eating go to go to Arby's once a week, but be here's we want to see some rim protect
*  We want to see those rotations. So can you work on that and he showed up? He's like, hey, I'm here
*  I'm doing my rotations. I'm a coach Chet eat this deep-fried turkey from turkey sandwich from Arby's
*  So after that then it's another drop-off and we could argue and I'm not gonna go through everybody but that's you go into this
*  Jimmy Butler Halliburton and bead
*  No idea where to put him anymore
*  James Harden
*  Good job by Harden marketing Zion Paul George like it then it gets complicated
*  But I do think that's the top 25 in some order. I love it. It's great
*  When do we get to you have you have your notes on this?
*  No, because it's so early and we're just sort of like trying to be measured trying to have a little bit of a
*  Proper reaction. I like that you gave some extra credit to the OG
*  because of how they gave gave another gold medal to America like that
*  Aspect of it, but this is you know, it's it's constantly evolving
*  It's constantly a work in progress and it's gonna be fun to like when we do this again in a month
*  What's it gonna look like like who are the most likely to drop out and who's most likely to jump in?
*  So the big storylines coming out of this exercise is that I think the top ten is unassailable now at least for right now
*  That's you have a top ten. Yokich, Don Chichianes, SGA, Tatum, Curry, Durant, Edwards, Brunson, Davis
*  so those are the ten best guys in the league right now and
*  Then I think
*  Townsend Holmgren moving in the top 25 is significant
*  Great. I would have had those guys in the 30s this summer
*  And then Wim Binyama who I had ten heading into the season dropping to 16 not nothing either
*  Jacobi we'll see maybe Jacobi is gonna be a skip Bayless
*  He's gonna start every show with a Luz Binyama attack. Jacobi Bayless
