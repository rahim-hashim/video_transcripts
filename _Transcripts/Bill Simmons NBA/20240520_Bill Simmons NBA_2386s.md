# Winners and Losers From the Wolves Game 7 Win in Denver | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg)
*  At halftime of the Knicks-Pasters game, the Knicks were down, I think 15. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=0.0s)]
*  And there was a stat about the biggest game seven halftime comeback ever. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=5.28s)]
*  And it was 11 points. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=10.82s)]
*  It was the biggest game seven halftime comeback ever. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=12.66s)]
*  It was Golden State in 1975 against Chicago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  And then our guy Steph Curry did it against Houston in 2018. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=18.26s)]
*  11 was the record. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=21.36s)]
*  Until today, Minnesota came back from 15 down. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  I think they had a 54 to 24 run at one point. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=26.34s)]
*  And they took the belt from the champs, at least for this round. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=30.16s)]
*  What was the biggest thing that jumped out of you this game other than [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=34.28s)]
*  a habit about seven heart attacks? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=37.24s)]
*  That I kind of just can't believe it actually happened. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=40.88s)]
*  No. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=43.2s)]
*  Cause if you were going to lay it all out, I picked Minnesota in the series, but it [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=43.36s)]
*  wasn't like I was walking around today being like, yeah, Denver, no problem. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=45.76s)]
*  Like they'll figure it out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=48.66s)]
*  Like when I saw Jokic standing up for the six straight minutes, and everybody was [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=49.86s)]
*  sending out that picture from game six, when Minnesota was up 50, you're like, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=52.56s)]
*  Oh, you know, this, this could be bad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=56.24s)]
*  And the game was kind of playing out a way that a lot of these games play. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=59.76s)]
*  Like I love this series. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=62.88s)]
*  I love this series, but we haven't had these amazing finishes in them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=63.96s)]
*  I just like how different it's been. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  I think these are the two best teams in the NBA. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=69.36s)]
*  And maybe we'll get into that a little bit, but that it actually happened that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=71.64s)]
*  they pulled this off this team. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  That's, you know, just, this is, I guess, year two of this group, but it's not [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=77.04s)]
*  like it was a deep run last year, but they actually did it and that Ant was this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=81.48s)]
*  bad throw of most of the game and they were able to do it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=85.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=89.28s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=89.48s)]
*  He was six for 24, which was a famous stat line, Kobe 2010 finals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=90.24s)]
*  And yet I thought he was a huge part of this game. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=95.84s)]
*  I liked the way he played. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=98.12s)]
*  His shot wasn't going in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=99.16s)]
*  They're throwing two, three people at him and he had to slowly figure [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=100.56s)]
*  out over the course of the game. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=103.76s)]
*  How can I still affect this game with my offense when they're just basically [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=105.6s)]
*  putting this wall in front of me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=109.12s)]
*  And what took it over for him, they put them on Murray at some point in the third [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=110.76s)]
*  quarter and Murray disappeared and he did the best job guarding Jabaal Murray [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=114.6s)]
*  I've ever seen anybody do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=118.76s)]
*  And the defense got the offense going a little bit. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=120.28s)]
*  They got some steals, some turnovers, but it was reminiscent of Kobe in that game [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=122.64s)]
*  seven, where it was, it went from seeming like it was going to be this just [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  historic disaster for him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=131.6s)]
*  And something mentioned the first sentence of his, of his, uh, NBA [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=133.24s)]
*  basketball reference, whenever we talked about him, so he flipped the game [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  and he started pounding the rim. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=140.56s)]
*  He got rebounds and he just figured out how to affect it with his [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=142.24s)]
*  defense all these different ways. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=145.08s)]
*  And I thought it was such a special ant game because sometimes when you're not [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=147.28s)]
*  playing well, that's kind of where you have to show how good of a basketball [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  player you are, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=156.44s)]
*  Like you can have games where they, where the ball goes in and it looks great, but [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  it's games like this, when you just have to figure out, I don't really have it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  How else can I help the team? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=164.72s)]
*  And then towns gets in foul trouble and you could just see Edwards and then [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  Nasridi, they're just trying to lift each other up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=170.28s)]
*  I thought it was really cool. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=172.88s)]
*  I think this team is really in on each other and really sticks up for each other. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=173.88s)]
*  And there's no ego at all with these guys. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  They just want to win. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=180.88s)]
*  And they showed it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=181.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=184.04s)]
*  They were sending doubles of him with like zero caution. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=184.2s)]
*  I mean, if Kat had it at the top of the key and then swung it to ant, Kat's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  guy would just come to double ant. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=191.84s)]
*  Like they just didn't care. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=193.8s)]
*  They're like, go ahead. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=195.04s)]
*  Jokic was coming up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=195.8s)]
*  Jokic was coming up too. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=196.96s)]
*  And sometimes there was like a triangle in front of them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=198.28s)]
*  So one of the things that they lost this series, I think they would have gone back [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  and looked at it and seen if there's any way that you can like dribble away from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  the double or throw it to somebody and then get it right back, because usually [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=208.28s)]
*  the double doesn't stay with you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Like there has to be more at the rim. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=213.28s)]
*  There has to be more there with the drives. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=215.12s)]
*  And then we saw ant try to do it, but like one of the most frustrating plays [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  when I thought at that point, I'm like, all right, where's this game going to go? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=221.44s)]
*  He was on a drive and he like threw it off the Rudy to a side. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=224.92s)]
*  And I'm like, what is going on? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=228.0s)]
*  But you're absolutely right about the defense. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=231.88s)]
*  You're absolutely right about the defense. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  He was incredible. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  This defense that was as impressive as anything I've seen all season in the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  first half of game two, and now I don't know that it was exactly that again [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=238.12s)]
*  throughout it all, but Nas Reed coming in and he decided to attack. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  He had his layup where he didn't want to pass it to Rudy when Rudy was wide open [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=246.6s)]
*  at the baseline, Rudy made a great play on an offensive rebound to even keep one [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  of the other possessions alive. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  And then, you know, cat has that follow dunk where I think it was Pope just fell [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  asleep and let him crash the rim. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=260.96s)]
*  And that was kind of the game. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=263.56s)]
*  So cat had some really good moments offensively and they needed to carry ant [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=264.91999999999996s)]
*  because six of 24 is just like, if you were going to say, Hey, those Timberlake [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  are going to win and ants going to go six to 24, he'd be like, well, what? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  There's no way that happened. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  And it did. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=277.88s)]
*  He had seven assists, two steals, eight rebounds. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=279.32s)]
*  So the other guys in Denver scored 21 points. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=282.4s)]
*  And we can go with all the Minnesota stuff, but Michael Porter, Jr. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  Aaron Gordon wasn't rebounding at all for some reason. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=289.76s)]
*  Caldwell Pope didn't have it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=292.32s)]
*  Nobody on their bench came through and gave them any sort of game seven, a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  rational conference boost. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=297.24s)]
*  And, uh, if you, so you said the six for 24 thing with ant I'd flip it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=299.24s)]
*  If I told you everyone on Denver, not named Yoko Jomura is going to score 21 [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  points in this game, we would have been like, Ooh, that sounds not great. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=309.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=314.12s)]
*  So, you know, I thought this was a pretty good Yoko Jomura game for the most part, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=314.48s)]
*  but the other guys let him down. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=319.32s)]
*  And I don't know the league's better than it was last year. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=320.92s)]
*  I don't, they don't have Bruce Brown. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  They weren't, they weren't the Porter game. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=326.56s)]
*  The last, like, uh, I don't know the, at least three stinkers from [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  him in this series, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=333.88s)]
*  No, the last four games, he scored a total of 25 points. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  He was the third leading score tonight with seven. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=338.24s)]
*  Aaron Gordon played 42 minutes, had four points, four rebounds. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=340.88s)]
*  And maybe the rebounds there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=343.76s)]
*  Cause Yoko was insane with the rebounding, especially in the first half, but still, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=344.96s)]
*  like it's hard to play 42 minutes and have four points and four rebounds. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=348.64s)]
*  So the two guys did it, even if maybe just because of the status that we have [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=352.24s)]
*  Yoko chat, you're like, I actually needed more out of you offensively. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=356.48s)]
*  Like I needed a little bit more. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=360.32s)]
*  He went, Oh, for seven on his, I think first seven, three point attempts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=361.56s)]
*  He had a couple there later in the game, but you know, throughout all of the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=365.2s)]
*  different stuff that's happened in this series, it's funny to think that like the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=369.44s)]
*  guy that probably impeded Yoko to the most was cat. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=372.8s)]
*  You know, I'm glad you brought this up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=377.72s)]
*  There's so many winners and losers from this game in this series. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  And I made a list at halftime and half of the guys who I had as winners [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=383.36s)]
*  of losers that either flipped one way or the other way, or then I added new guys. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=388.12s)]
*  Townes, the guy I wouldn't say is, is either of our favorite player, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=392.2s)]
*  No, he's good. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=399.36s)]
*  He was really good tonight. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  He did pick up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=402.64s)]
*  He did pick up the ridiculous fifth foul. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  We're like, Oh no, you were doing so well. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=406.0s)]
*  It was like watching a little kid in the playground, like, Oh no, you threw sand [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  at somebody, why, why you're, you're having such a fun time with everybody. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=411.64s)]
*  But I thought he kept him in it in the first half when he didn't have anything. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=415.32s)]
*  I thought his defense on Yoko was really good. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=419.24s)]
*  And I really liked how he played. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  I thought that was like a breakthrough game for him. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=423.28s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=426.4s)]
*  No, but I mean, it is funny because what? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=427.68s)]
*  Nas did when he came off, they were going to bring him back in. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=429.36s)]
*  Well, they, I was like, they really did. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=433.76s)]
*  I mean, they didn't have to though, because Nas came in and that, that was like one [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  of three times the game flipped. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=439.76s)]
*  Now I said that huge block on Yoko and the big put back dunk. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=441.8s)]
*  And at that point, then Edwards had the back break three and turns. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden it was 98, 92, 82 out of nowhere and towns. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=450.0s)]
*  Wasn't involved in any of that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=453.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=455.12s)]
*  And then Rudy files out. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=455.36s)]
*  So cat comes back in to close it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=456.48s)]
*  But it, it was just a weird game. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=457.88s)]
*  I mean, game sentences are weird. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=460.76s)]
*  Whatever happened to the home court thing, it's over. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=462.36s)]
*  It's just, if you, if you cut the NBA history by a certain line, you know, it [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=465.4s)]
*  used to be what 80% maybe 82% of the time teams won or maybe it used to be over. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=470.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=475.64s)]
*  It just used to be like, you lose that game. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=475.96s)]
*  And for whatever reason, recent history tells you that that home court [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=478.4s)]
*  hasn't meant as much with this, but I'm just really impressed. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=481.88s)]
*  You know, I'm just incredibly impressed with this group, finding a different way [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=486.64s)]
*  to win, finding a different way to win against a team in Denver, where you're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=490.44s)]
*  like, okay, well what's the score going to be? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=493.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=494.96s)]
*  They're going to be at home. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=495.2s)]
*  You'll get your Murray and all these different things. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=496.35999999999996s)]
*  You just expect it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=497.76s)]
*  Every possession is going by being like, they're screwed up offensively. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  Like this defense has cranked it up a level here and everybody's kind of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=502.2s)]
*  contributing and even McDaniel's too deserves love for having a couple of big [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=506.32s)]
*  offensive games because he's just capable of having like a four or six point dud [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  in there and all these other guys stepped up and, and be, you know, a team [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=514.28s)]
*  that I would have picked against Dallas, a team in Denver that I would have picked [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  against the Boston Indy winner. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=521.96s)]
*  You know, I just would have picked Denver the rest of the way and they found a way [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=524.24s)]
*  to get them at their place. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=528.0s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=528.96s)]
*  Jokic played 23 minutes in the first half, 13, 15, five in the first half. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=531.0s)]
*  They started out altitude. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  I thought he looked tired. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=542.08s)]
*  I, it felt like he just needed a blow at some point. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  And the fact that Minnesota could just bring Nas read off the bench as this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  fresh, you know, like some reliever in the ninth inning coming in and just [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=551.0s)]
*  throwing 103 miles an hour. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=555.52s)]
*  I don't think that was helping matters. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=556.92s)]
*  They played seven guys in that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=558.4s)]
*  I mean, Kyle Anderson only played four minutes. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=559.6s)]
*  Which was, I think the right move, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=562.16s)]
*  Did you feel like at halftime, they were going to dump go bear? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=564.24s)]
*  Uh, well, you know, my biggest issue with this game, and if it had gone the other [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=568.72s)]
*  way, you know, this would have come up, but I still think it's a relevant point [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=572.84s)]
*  is that Rudy was ending up with the ball way too much. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=575.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=578.2800000000001s)]
*  Too many possessions. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  We were like, okay, well, I understand defensively what you think you have, but. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=579.4s)]
*  You know, some of you guys, and that's why I thought that Nas read layup was so [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=583.2s)]
*  interesting because he didn't have great balance, but he's like, you know, if I [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=585.84s)]
*  just sort of lean over this way and Rudy like at his hands up ready for the catch [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=588.48s)]
*  and Nas is like, no, but I just am never going, I don't care, win or lose. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=591.44s)]
*  And even though Rudy threw in that prayer with five seconds left in the shot clock, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=596.88s)]
*  which was ridiculous. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=600.72s)]
*  And at that point, you're like, maybe it's Minnesota's night. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=601.68s)]
*  I just am never going to be a huge fan of when Rudy ends up with a ball in his [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=604.4s)]
*  hands as many times as he did in the first half tonight, but the defense and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=608.8s)]
*  that offensive rebound he had late was such a huge offensive rebound that I just [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=612.2399999999999s)]
*  don't think coaches do the stuff that we always wonder if they'll do. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=620.28s)]
*  Well, they had 11 offensive rebounds. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=621.28s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up that turnaround. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=623.56s)]
*  So Minnesota, I think had five or six shots in the second half. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=626.16s)]
*  Where you go, what the fuck that that went in? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  Like there was one where Nas Reed got like, it looked like he got almost got a [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  hit and he just kind of flung it with his left hand and it just like line [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=637.96s)]
*  drived in from five feet. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=641.32s)]
*  McDaniel's had one go bear had that one when he was going down the middle and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=643.12s)]
*  he just flung it off the backboard and it went in and they started adding up. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=647.12s)]
*  And I always keep track of that because it's, it's basically like this stat that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=650.84s)]
*  they don't keep track of them. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=654.64s)]
*  Basketballreference.com or the, you know, the how the fuck did that go in shots? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  And then when go bear made that crazy turnaround, that was the first time I [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=660.36s)]
*  was like, holy shit, Minnesota might actually win this game. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=665.36s)]
*  But I kept waiting for the late Denver run. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=668.24s)]
*  Like I tweeted at one point, I thought it was going to go in overtime. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=670.96s)]
*  Cause I just thought we've seen it so many times with Denver that as soon as [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=673.36s)]
*  like they came, the game calmed down a little with three, four minutes left. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=677.48s)]
*  They were just going to do their thing. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=681.4s)]
*  And the problem for them was they were just doubling Oakage basically the whole [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=683.28s)]
*  time and really from the first quarter, you know, he only had, I don't even [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=687.92s)]
*  think he got, he got seven assists. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  Um, and they missed some shots from him, but for the most part, they were, uh, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=695.4s)]
*  they're basically imploring him to pass to everybody else and then nobody [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=700.4799999999999s)]
*  else could make a shot. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=703.9599999999999s)]
*  So that, that was smart. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  Um, 34 points for him, 47 minutes, but. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  It just didn't feel, it felt like they were a little discombobulated and the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=710.68s)]
*  defense would by Minnesota in the second half was on par with the game two [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=714.48s)]
*  defense, I thought, right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=717.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know that I'd put it at that just cause it was those first 24 minutes [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=721.08s)]
*  because you know, when I'm looking at how it was, it was like 61, 55 and Denver [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=724.2800000000001s)]
*  still has the lead and cat, you know, at that point at 17 points, he's six for 11. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=729.0s)]
*  No, and it just had a bad turnover, but I was tracking some of the threes [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=733.96s)]
*  like Yokech, KCP Porter, Jr. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  Yokech had a nice step back that usually always hits. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=740.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are four shots in that stretch where I'm like, these are [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  all really good looks, but you know, whether you can combine like, I don't [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  know if it's the exact same thing. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=750.6s)]
*  Cause I do think it's hard for somebody like Ann at this stage of his career to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=752.08s)]
*  be like, okay, I want to make the right play. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=754.6s)]
*  I don't want to force anything. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=756.16s)]
*  So I'm going to actually get rid of the ball. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=757.24s)]
*  And the doubles were so hard. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  It wasn't like, Hey, let's be tricky with these and disguise them. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=760.2s)]
*  It's just, we're, we don't care. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=763.12s)]
*  Like this is what we're going to do. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=765.2s)]
*  And lucky enough, Minnesota had enough balance around it to, to not, you [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=767.04s)]
*  know, end up being something where it's like, okay, we're really stuck. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=772.0s)]
*  Cause nobody else is making any shots. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  So I wonder if that just throws ants rhythm off where it's like, if nothing's [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=776.52s)]
*  ever really felt all that comfortable and then that adds to everything else. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=779.96s)]
*  And that's, you know, that's the task that is attached to the great ones. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=783.12s)]
*  We're like, Hey, you still need to go ahead and figure this out. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  Where with Denver, like there's all these good looks, I thought even during that [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=789.32s)]
*  stretch where yes, some of it's definitely the defense, but there were other times [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=793.08s)]
*  I'm like, how, man, you guys are just. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=796.6s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=798.72s)]
*  I don't know if they started feeling themselves up 20, cause you're not [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=799.76s)]
*  thinking there's no way if you're Denver, you think you're blowing a 20 [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=802.56s)]
*  point lead to Minnesota. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=806.64s)]
*  They were eight for 33 from three. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=808.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=811.3599999999999s)]
*  I took notes as, you know, I always, especially for this game, I wanted to [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  take notes as it went along and the first note I had in the third quarter was [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=815.5999999999999s)]
*  Minnesota gets it to 61 57. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=819.4s)]
*  I don't understand what happened. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=823.64s)]
*  They had a 19 to three run and it didn't feel like anything substantial was [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=824.0s)]
*  happening, but all of a sudden they were just getting stops and scoring on the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=829.04s)]
*  other side. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=832.0s)]
*  And at some point it was like, Oh, this is 10. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, this is eight. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=836.0799999999999s)]
*  And Denver just looked a little flustered and it was the kind of spot, especially [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=837.4s)]
*  last year, where they would get Porter or Bruce Brown or somebody else would start [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=842.16s)]
*  making a couple of plays for them. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=847.52s)]
*  And they just, it just didn't happen for them today. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=848.9599999999999s)]
*  I thought, I just thought it was such a fascinating Edwards game. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=852.0s)]
*  I mean, my memory of this game 20 years from now will be Ant, who is clearly going [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=856.2s)]
*  to be a really special player, barring injury. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=861.0s)]
*  Like he's really the, like the shit that he's done in the playoffs. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=863.24s)]
*  Now this is, we are now on the track for something truly, truly, truly special. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=867.0s)]
*  And it's games like this that form somebody's career. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=872.32s)]
*  It's when you don't have it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=875.32s)]
*  How do you figure out how else to impact the game? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=877.28s)]
*  And he, and he did it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=879.44s)]
*  And I thought, I never felt like, you know, you and I have watched a lot of [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=880.32s)]
*  Edwards. I never felt like he lost his confidence, right? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=883.8s)]
*  They never showed him where I was like, Oh, Ant's rattled. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=887.3599999999999s)]
*  Ooh, Ant doesn't look like, Ant doesn't look like he has it or Ant's got like [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  darty eyes or anything. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=895.0799999999999s)]
*  It's just, it just looked like he was like, I know, I know what's happening. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  I got to figure out how to solve this, but I never felt like he was rattled. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=899.76s)]
*  It's so unusual for a 22 year old. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=902.88s)]
*  It's really, it's really like about as uncommon as it gets for the NBA. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=906.56s)]
*  My point. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=910.6s)]
*  I don't know if I'm all the way there with you, but I think your point is [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=913.5600000000001s)]
*  stronger by when you remind us of the defense that he stayed in it defensively [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=917.28s)]
*  where there's other players that are scorers when they're not scoring. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=923.24s)]
*  Then the two things are connected. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=927.52s)]
*  And the fact that he was like, all right, I got to, I got to figure something out [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=929.48s)]
*  like the steal on Murray and then the dunk, you know, that was just another [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=933.64s)]
*  reminder, a bit like the game two stuff that we were talking about. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  It's like, okay, like you're not going to just be able to bring the ball up. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=939.16s)]
*  You're just not going to be able to. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=942.16s)]
*  I mean, it's, I can't wait to see what they try to throw at Dallas because, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=943.68s)]
*  you know, McDaniels just isn't stout enough. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=950.04s)]
*  I imagine Ann will get a chance as well. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=951.92s)]
*  You know, they'll probably try a bunch of different things, but it's so brutal [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=954.28s)]
*  when you can't get into your offense as quick as you're used to getting into it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=958.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=962.24s)]
*  And, you know, there was a, I think a five and a half minutes stretch during [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=962.48s)]
*  this entire Minnesota run to come back and get this game where Denver doesn't [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=965.76s)]
*  score a point or didn't make a field goal. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=968.8s)]
*  I think there might've been a free throw in there where they didn't score [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  for like five and a half minutes. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=972.9599999999999s)]
*  So, uh, yeah, credit to Ann and the defense stuff, but you just. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=973.9599999999999s)]
*  Wait, one more thing on the ant piece. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=977.7199999999999s)]
*  He didn't do the thing either where, and it's like, it's not going for me. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=980.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to frantically drive to the basket into seven people. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=983.76s)]
*  And like, he was driving in the basket, but he was still like kicking out and [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=986.68s)]
*  he was making the right plays and setting up people. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=990.68s)]
*  And so I, I never felt like he lost control of the game where we've watched [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=993.3199999999999s)]
*  other young players in that situation. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  And sometimes I, especially with younger players, I feel like, oh, they're, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1000.8399999999999s)]
*  now they're pressing too much. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1004.2399999999999s)]
*  Now I can see they're doing this, but he just kind of put all of his energy in [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1005.56s)]
*  a defense and just trying to continue to get into the paint. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1008.64s)]
*  It was weirdly a good six for 24. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1012.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1014.4s)]
*  I don't know how else to put it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1014.68s)]
*  Like, I don't feel that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1015.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't feel that bad about it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1016.88s)]
*  Like he airballed a shot at one point. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1018.1199999999999s)]
*  They, there was like, he, he bricked some threes and I'm like, oh my God, is [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1020.5999999999999s)]
*  this just going to go south? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1024.76s)]
*  And it didn't. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1026.8s)]
*  He fought out of it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1027.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1029.44s)]
*  But I, I feel like, you know, whatever was waiting for him, if they don't pull [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1029.64s)]
*  this off, it's like, oh, you know, yeah, the guys that liked him, liked him. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1033.96s)]
*  And they still like them, you know, like I don't look at Yokech today going, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1038.88s)]
*  okay, we need, there are certain players that I feel a certain way about. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1042.8000000000002s)]
*  And even players who I don't like, I don't expect them to score zero points [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1046.4s)]
*  all the time in the playoffs. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1049.5600000000002s)]
*  And this is kind of what it turns into a little bit. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  So had they lost, you know, and it gets crushed and then it's like, okay, well, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1053.0400000000002s)]
*  he had a, he had a really bad game in a huge spot. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1057.32s)]
*  I would not have questioned him for the bad game. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1060.04s)]
*  I'm thinking more like the fact that they won and pulled it out. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1061.8799999999999s)]
*  What does that mean compared to some of the great players we've seen in the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1064.6s)]
*  past, right? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1067.44s)]
*  Cause like, Kobe had that moment and, and maybe, and this, maybe they lose next [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1068.04s)]
*  round and it's not going to matter as much, but Kobe had that moment in the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1073.04s)]
*  finals in Indiana when Shaq fouled out. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1075.44s)]
*  And he had to like lift the team basically. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1078.0s)]
*  And it was like, oh, can he do this? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1079.96s)]
*  And I was like, oh, okay, he can do this. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1081.16s)]
*  You know, LeBron had that moment against Detroit in 07 when it was like, well, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1083.2s)]
*  if you don't score every time your team's going to lose, he was like, oh, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1090.0400000000002s)]
*  maybe I can score every time. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1092.96s)]
*  And he scored like 25 straight and Edwards in this game. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1094.3600000000001s)]
*  It's like, Hey, unless you become a two-way player in the highest possible level [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1097.76s)]
*  and you start actually making a couple of plays and shots and you shut down [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1102.64s)]
*  Murray on the other end, you guys aren't winning. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1106.24s)]
*  And then he actually did it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1108.0800000000002s)]
*  So I don't know what this means for him going forward, but I thought it was a [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1109.68s)]
*  good checkpoint for him to hit, I guess is my point. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1112.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1115.72s)]
*  I don't know that you said something in the beginning that I don't know. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1115.92s)]
*  Like, I don't, I don't think this game would have been in the first line of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1118.88s)]
*  his, his career obituary. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1122.72s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1127.8s)]
*  I just think there's still so much to do with it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1128.88s)]
*  No, I said that about Kobe. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  I didn't say that about him. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1132.1200000000001s)]
*  I was talking about that Kobe 2010 finals. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1133.92s)]
*  Like if they had lost at home, he'd gone like four for 28. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1136.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1142.12s)]
*  So some winners and losers. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1142.36s)]
*  And we can just talk about this one at a time at halftime. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1143.6s)]
*  It felt like the anti-go bear trade take people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1147.36s)]
*  We were going to be winners. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1151.2s)]
*  They're like, see, told you. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1152.96s)]
*  And then what happens? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1157.36s)]
*  Um, second half, it's Rudy actually did some good stuff in the, in the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1158.6s)]
*  second half, I thought, and, um, was not a detriment. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1162.8s)]
*  I was thinking in the first half to get aunt going, they were going to have to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1167.12s)]
*  take them out so they could spread the floor for them and give them more space. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1170.8s)]
*  Turned out it didn't matter, but he had some good moments. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1174.28s)]
*  He had some good rebounds. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1176.52s)]
*  Seven to nine free throws. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1178.0s)]
*  That was huge. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1179.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1179.96s)]
*  Made a couple of free throws. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1180.28s)]
*  He was ending up with the wall so much. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1183.12s)]
*  And then he got fouled a lot on those catches. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1184.8s)]
*  When you look at his total shot attempts, I mean, he only had seven field [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1187.9199999999998s)]
*  goal attempts that felt like he ended up with a ball a ton in the first half. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1190.84s)]
*  So the guy made his free throws and you know, the Aaron Gordon stuff that was [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1193.3999999999999s)]
*  him bringing the ball up him running under the Tucker spot, you know, having [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  those burst moments for, for four or six minutes where Denver feels like, okay, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1201.8s)]
*  cool Gordon's doing stuff, maybe to open up something for the rest of us here. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1206.3999999999999s)]
*  And then it doesn't happen. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1210.56s)]
*  So yeah, Rudy, I just don't want to update the Rudy trade every 24 hours. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  No, we're going to, that's what we're going to do on Sundays. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1216.32s)]
*  Um, Yokeage, Yokeage in a loss 34, 19 and seven. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1219.56s)]
*  And, uh, this series for him reminded me a little of. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1226.92s)]
*  Yanis and that Milwaukee Boston series the year after they won when [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1231.24s)]
*  Yanis was just awesome. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1235.4s)]
*  And then Boston beat them anyway, and beat them for reasons that really didn't [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1238.04s)]
*  have a lot to do with the honest, right. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1242.28s)]
*  And it was, you still left the series going, wow, Yanis is incredible. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1245.04s)]
*  I'm still going to leave this serious thinking, wow, Yokeage is incredible. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1248.52s)]
*  Uh, they felt third quarter is third quarter game five. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1252.56s)]
*  Is like, I saw something where it was like, arguably one of the two best [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1255.96s)]
*  quarters in playoff history based on his shooting point total and the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1259.0s)]
*  assists and all that kind of stuff. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1262.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1263.92s)]
*  I'll, I'll admit, like, I think I have him just such an absurd standard that [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1264.24s)]
*  maybe I wanted a little bit more from him offensively down the stretch, but. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  He's not just going to take a million bad shots. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1272.04s)]
*  It's just not who he is. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1273.96s)]
*  So if he had taken five more shots and went one to five, will we say he was [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1274.88s)]
*  aggressive, more aggressive, but yeah, I'm basically there with you. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1278.2s)]
*  I think the Yanis comp is perfect. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1281.96s)]
*  Cause you know, sometimes these guys are this good when they lose. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1283.44s)]
*  I'm not going to go like, all right, I got to move them down now. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1285.68s)]
*  Two for 10 from three. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1288.64s)]
*  Um, and didn't protect the boards. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1291.52s)]
*  Minnesota got a couple of offensive boards. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1294.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't see we're taping this. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1296.48s)]
*  I didn't get a chance to watch the second half again and really study it, but, um, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1298.16s)]
*  it felt like all of a sudden they felt a little okay. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1302.52s)]
*  See, yes. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1304.96s)]
*  Trying to pretend to protect the, uh, the boards. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1305.4s)]
*  So Murray had a couple catches though. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1308.5600000000002s)]
*  He had that one three and Reggie did pointed out like on the catch. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1310.44s)]
*  She was hesitant. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1313.92s)]
*  And I feel like I see this a lot from guys where they pass on the better look [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1314.88s)]
*  on the catch and then set themselves into a worst look and he had one of those. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1318.96s)]
*  But you know, I'm nitpicking here. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1323.24s)]
*  Murray finished with 35, he had 24 in the first half and it looked like we were [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1325.4s)]
*  going to have to update the, I, one of the segments, if Denver had won one of [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  the segments I want to do with you were how many guards would you take before we [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1335.72s)]
*  get to Murray and go through that? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1338.92s)]
*  But then then ends up blowing the game. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1340.92s)]
*  So we're not through that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1342.92s)]
*  But the Yokojimari combo, which I still think is really special. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1343.64s)]
*  And you know, Denver won last year, Minnesota hasn't won yet. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1348.3600000000001s)]
*  There's a hunger level that I feel like factors in just a whiff and games like [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1353.0400000000002s)]
*  this, where when you've been there and you've been the hunted one for the entire [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1359.2s)]
*  season, plus the playoffs versus the team, that's like, this would be the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1362.92s)]
*  literally the highlight of my career. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1366.92s)]
*  If we win this game and you could feel it a little bit, Denver just looked a [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1368.48s)]
*  little tired to me and a little static compared to Minnesota, who just, you see [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1372.32s)]
*  their bench, the tire bench is fucking losing their minds on every basket, every [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1377.44s)]
*  block, everything. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1382.08s)]
*  They just, you know, it's the law of the NBA. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1382.92s)]
*  I don't know who has a good time being outscored 54-24, but you're right about [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1387.28s)]
*  Minnesota. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1391.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1395.4s)]
*  Like, Hey, we're getting worked by like 30 since we were up 20, but hey, let's [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1395.68s)]
*  start, let's start high. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1398.88s)]
*  De'Andre, you want to get a cheer going? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1399.96s)]
*  Uh, Hey, you want to start the wave? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1401.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1404.9199999999998s)]
*  So they seem, they seem shell shocked. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1405.24s)]
*  The fact when Minnesota came back, I thought that demeanor changed for Denver [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1407.4399999999998s)]
*  when it was like 61 57 felt different. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  You're not a little shell shocked that this actually happened. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1415.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I am. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1418.76s)]
*  I am. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1421.04s)]
*  It didn't seem real until Ann hit the three. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  Even when they're up seven with the ball, I'm like, nah, I really thought we were [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1425.84s)]
*  headed over time or something and then Ann hit the three, the turnaround and [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1429.68s)]
*  turned around to the court side. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1434.08s)]
*  When Kat couldn't get it inbounded and it was a turnover, I was like, wait, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1435.76s)]
*  I'm like, what's this going to be one of these all time moments of like, remember [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1440.1200000000001s)]
*  when they were up eight and all this bad stuff happened? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1443.24s)]
*  No, there was part of me that was like, Oh no, is this, and here's the great [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1448.44s)]
*  thing about the wind. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1452.0s)]
*  We'll never think about that play. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1452.72s)]
*  Another winner loss. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1454.04s)]
*  A loser I think is, is Denver. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1456.12s)]
*  As we started thinking about what kind of run could this team go on their [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1458.24s)]
*  window was the two years before they won the title and Murray missed last year, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1462.6s)]
*  this year, and probably like two more. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1468.08s)]
*  And there's a bunch of teams coming and now they've won one title and that's it, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1470.1599999999999s)]
*  which makes them no different than Milwaukee, which makes them no different [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1475.3999999999999s)]
*  than Kauai and Toronto. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  I think we'll be hearing from them again. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1480.24s)]
*  I'm sure they'll probably go into the lab. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1481.68s)]
*  Kyle Mann texted this to me. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1485.0s)]
*  Actually, I thought it was an interesting question. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1486.64s)]
*  Does this loss, if you're Denver, make you start to think you need to do [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  something a little more drastic than that? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1493.72s)]
*  Do you start thinking about beyond Yokojimuri and Gordon? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1496.48s)]
*  I think you start looking at that Michael Jordan, the guy that you're [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1501.8s)]
*  looking at in a little more seriously. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1505.8s)]
*  Hey, is this, is this something we should move on? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1507.4s)]
*  Well, the problem, whenever we bring up this stuff is just, okay, but like how [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1513.36s)]
*  bold do you want to get for a team that, you know, was right there and being a [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1518.48s)]
*  one seed until the last weekend, who may have lost to the eventual champs? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1522.28s)]
*  Because this was an absurd situation for a team that was just, you know, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1528.8799999999999s)]
*  the eventual champs, because this was an absurd second round matchup. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1532.72s)]
*  So if there was a player that was really good, that was unhappy, and then it's [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1537.44s)]
*  like, I actually want to play in Denver, which is a great athlete city, but I [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1540.68s)]
*  don't know that people ever think of it as a destination, anybody that's ever [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1544.3600000000001s)]
*  played sports there is like, oh wait, like everybody always seems to keep a house [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1546.96s)]
*  there because Colorado is awesome, but it's never thought of as like an NBA [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1550.16s)]
*  destination. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1554.3600000000001s)]
*  If you were talking about playing style, if you were a star that was like a [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1555.48s)]
*  little bit older and you're like, okay, I want to go play with that guy, Yokoj, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1558.0800000000002s)]
*  because he's going to make my life that much easier. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1561.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of reasons, but to get that bold, something would have to be [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1562.96s)]
*  available. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1565.92s)]
*  Porter Jr. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1566.48s)]
*  It was a bad series. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1567.2s)]
*  It just was, and he's really expensive for kind of a one dimensional guy. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1568.6s)]
*  But during that Lakers series, he was incredible. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1571.84s)]
*  Like he kept them in some of those games where if it were for him, you know, I [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1574.24s)]
*  still don't know that they were going to lose to the Lakers in seven, but Porter [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1578.68s)]
*  Jr. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1583.28s)]
*  kept them in some of those games when nobody else could really get anything [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1583.64s)]
*  going, especially with some of the Murray stuff, even though he hit the game [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1586.12s)]
*  winners. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1588.84s)]
*  It wasn't like he was just dominant all those games. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1589.1999999999998s)]
*  And the great thing about Porter Jr. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1591.6s)]
*  that I love from Bob Myers, who was on one of the calls of the game, like he [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1593.0s)]
*  ended up with 23 and eight and the shooting numbers are absurd, 55 and 49 [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1596.36s)]
*  from three. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1602.08s)]
*  And Bob was like, you know, this is somebody, this is the stuff with Myers [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1603.1999999999998s)]
*  that I like on the broadcast. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1606.6s)]
*  You know, I know it's the first year and everything, but he's sharing with you [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1607.8s)]
*  like what his evaluation was of certain players. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1610.6799999999998s)]
*  And he's like these rebounding numbers. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1613.52s)]
*  And then he had dove for a loose ball. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1615.32s)]
*  He goes, I can't believe Michael Porter Jr.'s diving for a lease. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1616.84s)]
*  He's like, I never had that in his scattering report. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  So I actually think there were some great playoff moments for him where he [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1622.1999999999998s)]
*  was more well-rounded as opposed to, you know, like he's not going to pass the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1626.04s)]
*  ball at time. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1629.28s)]
*  We know kind of what his game is at this point. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1629.84s)]
*  So with his injury history, I'm sure they would like if it was some other player, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1632.04s)]
*  we're like, okay, this completely raises our ceiling, but they're just like, when [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1637.28s)]
*  we pencil in the best three or four teams next year, Denver's on the list, this [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1640.48s)]
*  version of it already. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1644.24s)]
*  So as much as other teams are coming and OKC and whatever happens around here, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1645.8s)]
*  let me, let me put it to you this way. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1650.32s)]
*  I remember in 18 when we were doing the show together and Boston lost to [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1651.96s)]
*  Cleveland in game seven. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1655.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1656.84s)]
*  And you were like, this sucks because the window, you know, this is going to [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1657.84s)]
*  change, this is going to change all these things change, but we always assume that [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1663.8s)]
*  that change is going to be like much more of a positive with all of these teams. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1667.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1672.8s)]
*  And I don't, I think that's a mistake that we make. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1673.0s)]
*  I am in the, I think they keep the nucleus together and add around the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1678.2s)]
*  fringes and try to get a deeper bench. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1682.4s)]
*  You know, the fact that Peyton Watson didn't play, that was somebody that they [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1685.16s)]
*  were really counting on, right. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1687.76s)]
*  During the season in the playoffs. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1689.16s)]
*  And one of their bets was our young guys are going to fill in those Bruce [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1690.6s)]
*  Brown minutes didn't happen. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1693.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1695.48s)]
*  And that's how they drafted too. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1695.68s)]
*  The Porter series, his last four games, three for 12, three for nine, two for [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1697.36s)]
*  10, two for four, did have nine rebounds today, but for the most part was not a. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1702.0s)]
*  It was not an awesome series. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1707.4s)]
*  And I honestly felt like they needed them. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1708.36s)]
*  Um, they needed when he, like in the Laker series, he would have those little [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1712.36s)]
*  stretches where he would just kick ass for three minutes and they just [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1716.84s)]
*  didn't have that today. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1720.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1722.04s)]
*  My guess is what you laid out. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1722.76s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1725.76s)]
*  Is they'll add around the fringes, but it's just questions that I wouldn't have [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1726.88s)]
*  expected to ask because I think the bigger question for me is, was this the finals? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1730.12s)]
*  And if you're thinking like, we just lost the finals, that's a different than we [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1736.0s)]
*  just lost in round two, because I think these are the two best teams. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1739.6399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I, I'm not going to say either of those teams would have [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1742.56s)]
*  beaten Boston, but I think Boston is going to be underdogs against either of [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1746.1999999999998s)]
*  these teams unless poor Zangus is a hundred percent, which I just, you know, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1749.4799999999998s)]
*  he's already missing the first two to three games in round three at this point. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1754.08s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm just not going to look at this as like, Hey, the loser of the [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1758.9599999999998s)]
*  series couldn't get, Hey, I thought they were good. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1762.04s)]
*  They couldn't get out of the second round. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1763.8s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1765.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1765.8799999999999s)]
*  Like when, when this, before it started, as the series was playing out, I was [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  like, I almost feel like this is the finals. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1770.9199999999998s)]
*  Like we're, we're not supposed to get a team or a matchup between two teams [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1772.6s)]
*  like this in the second round. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1776.04s)]
*  With that said, it's a worse loss for Denver than it is for Minnesota. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1777.36s)]
*  Cause Minnesota could have been like, Hey man, now we know what it takes. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1780.6399999999999s)]
*  And sure. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1783.76s)]
*  Whereas Denver's trying to protect the title. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1784.8s)]
*  Um, a winner, co-winners, Devante Graham and Victor Rambanama, who actually [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1787.04s)]
*  affected the title because that Friday night game ends up sending Denver into [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1793.48s)]
*  the two, three round two, and they could have been in the one seed, get no Zion, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1798.32s)]
*  New Orleans. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1802.84s)]
*  They could have gone Dallas and round two and not seen Minnesota maybe at all. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1804.0s)]
*  And instead, um, Devante Graham, who probably, those are probably the last [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1809.84s)]
*  baskets will score in the NBA, I'm guessing. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1816.48s)]
*  I think he could still score. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1820.08s)]
*  I like the fact that Wemby affected the title. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1821.92s)]
*  Um, loser Michael Jordan. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1824.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1828.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1829.16s)]
*  How? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1830.48s)]
*  Cause at halftime it's like, yeah, fucking here was the latest comer and I sucked [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1831.16s)]
*  in game seven, I'm still the goat. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1836.1200000000001s)]
*  Now it's like, Oh, I don't know. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1838.28s)]
*  And I don't know MJ, you never won a title when you were 22. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1844.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1845.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1846.04s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1847.4s)]
*  I'm just, I'm just throwing it out there. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1848.08s)]
*  It's rarely you get to put a winners and losers with Michael Jordan in it. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  But now listen, no 22 year old other than 22 year old and under other than [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1852.92s)]
*  Kobe, I'm pretty sure has won the title. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1859.96s)]
*  Jordan didn't do it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1863.8s)]
*  Coward. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1865.68s)]
*  Ron didn't do it. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1865.96s)]
*  Uh, I think Bill Russell did it. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1868.32s)]
*  I don't know how old he was when they won the first title, but he was around 22, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1869.96s)]
*  but this is a whole other level of, of historical shit. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1872.92s)]
*  If Minnesota can actually win two more rounds, we'll see what happens. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1877.3200000000002s)]
*  We mentioned towns as a winner, Chris Finch, emotional. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1881.16s)]
*  He brought the crutches out. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1885.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you noticed, I felt like he was up off the bench a little bit more, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1887.16s)]
*  but, uh, but him and Mike Norrie figuring out how to coach this team together in a [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1890.2s)]
*  really weird situation and pull off a game seven win in Denver, I think, I think [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1895.76s)]
*  co-winners for me. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1899.68s)]
*  Micah has enough. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1901.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1902.8s)]
*  He's so much credibility built up with this team just because of his personality [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1903.1200000000001s)]
*  and being around, but I still think it's a little overstated. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1906.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, Finch is sitting right there. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1908.96s)]
*  Like you, what do you think Mike is going to do? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1910.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1912.6000000000001s)]
*  But what do you think he's going to do? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1912.8s)]
*  Can't argue with the refs? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1913.56s)]

*  Can't pull Anthony Edwards over to talk to him during time out, tell him to settle [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1915.8s)]
*  down. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1919.0s)]
*  It's not nothing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1920.44s)]
*  It's way less than people made it out to be. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1922.3600000000001s)]
*  He's right there. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1924.28s)]
*  Do you think Micah's turning around going, Hey, sorry, dude, you're sitting down. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1925.56s)]
*  I've got this. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1928.8s)]
*  Hey, could you, could you, could you let it seem like I'm in charge just a little [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1929.32s)]
*  bit more? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1934.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't the Lakers want Mike Norrie as their coach? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1934.96s)]
*  The only thing I can think of with their coaching search is that. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1939.1599999999999s)]
*  It's being run by Kurt Rambis. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1943.36s)]
*  No, that they're going to want, they're just going to want more sex appeal. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1945.32s)]
*  Post-Volgal and ham. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1949.96s)]
*  I mean, I think it should be Borrego, but I don't know if he's going to be sexy [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1952.12s)]
*  enough for them. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1955.9199999999998s)]
*  If Borrego gets the job, are you going to be on the bench? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1956.44s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1959.8s)]
*  I don't, I don't. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1961.2s)]
*  I have a hard second row. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1961.96s)]
*  Rossello. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1963.28s)]
*  I have a hard time getting credentials from the Lakers and the Clippers, so I [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1964.24s)]
*  don't think I would be on the bench. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, look, I'm a huge Borrego fan. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1968.64s)]
*  I've had him on the pot a couple of times, but I just, you know, for anyone that [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1970.24s)]
*  watched some of those Charlotte teams that were terrible. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1974.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1977.2s)]
*  And then every night you'd be like, all right, which fourth quarters do I have to [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1977.28s)]
*  get on? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1980.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1980.3600000000001s)]
*  Cause it's a good way to rotate through league paths. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1980.56s)]
*  And I think that's the only thing that's going to be on the bench. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1982.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1984.6399999999999s)]
*  Cause it's a good way to rotate through league paths. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1985.0s)]
*  You're like, all right, let me watch a full fourth quarter of this game that I [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1987.1599999999999s)]
*  wasn't normally going to watch start to finish. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1989.6399999999999s)]
*  And there's just all these Charlotte games where I'm like, how are they in this [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1990.84s)]
*  game? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1993.6399999999999s)]
*  How are they possibly in this game? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1994.0s)]
*  And he's got the Spurs background. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1996.6399999999999s)]
*  I hope he gets a chance to do it. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=1998.04s)]
*  I just don't know if, um, you know what I kind of would like? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2000.4399999999998s)]
*  I'd like to see JJ get it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2005.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think JJ could get it, but then it would be hilarious if they don't win [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2007.56s)]
*  it off and then he gets fired and LeBron on their podcast together says, you [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2014.56s)]
*  know, I actually never wanted you to be my head coach. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2019.32s)]
*  They're drinking wine. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2023.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2026.04s)]
*  Kurt Rambis did that. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2027.08s)]
*  And by the way, that's not a dig at JJ at all. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2028.08s)]
*  I think you understand what I'm saying. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2029.8s)]
*  Why are you worried about what JJ thinks? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2033.0s)]
*  I think I'm booked to go on next week. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2034.9199999999998s)]
*  Chris Finch mentioned him. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2038.12s)]
*  Do we mention team USA? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2042.04s)]
*  No, no one's more on team. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2044.72s)]
*  You're the most patriotic guy ever. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2046.04s)]
*  You really are a patriot. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2047.8799999999999s)]
*  Team USA standpoint, Steve Kerr is rooting for Denver to probably win. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2049.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2053.44s)]
*  Cause that means you're putting more miles on Murray heading into the [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2053.96s)]
*  Canada side of things. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2057.4s)]
*  And gets, it gets pulled out of the playoffs. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2059.0s)]
*  Now he could just devote himself to getting ready. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2062.12s)]
*  Now this, now this flips the other way. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2064.08s)]
*  Murray has more time. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2065.72s)]
*  Jokic has more time. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2067.52s)]
*  And it's going to be in the grind for at least two more weeks. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2069.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2072.84s)]
*  It could be good for you as team USA too. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2072.96s)]
*  Nas Reed, big winner, vindicated the six man of the year award. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2075.0800000000004s)]
*  He was, he was huge. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2079.92s)]
*  Those are for Monk or Reed. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2081.2400000000002s)]
*  I voted for Monk second. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2083.96s)]
*  I voted Nas first and he had the huge block on Jokic too. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2086.84s)]
*  When it was up around the rim. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2090.84s)]
*  I mean, the Nas minutes were incredible down the stretch. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2092.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's just what a weapon to be able to go, Hey, we need a [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2097.52s)]
*  third guy who can kind of balance out our other two bigs and could also stretch [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2100.92s)]
*  the floor. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2104.64s)]
*  And it's, it's incredible the job that, you know, Conley and this front office [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  did of identifying him. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2109.44s)]
*  So, uh, I have a, I have a winner for you. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2110.52s)]
*  Can I make it Nas Reed point really quick and then give me your winner? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2115.32s)]
*  Please. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2118.6s)]
*  There's certain guys that if you were in a coma for like 10 years and you came [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2119.4s)]
*  out of the coma and you watched a quarter of a basketball game and you saw a guy [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2123.72s)]
*  playing like Nas Reed played today and you would ask like, is that one of the [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2128.0s)]
*  five best players in the league? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2130.7200000000003s)]
*  Which is like its own weird NBA list of guys who for six minutes can seem like [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2133.0800000000004s)]
*  they're a second team on NBA player. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2138.7200000000003s)]
*  Nas Reed is definitely on that list. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2140.44s)]
*  If you catch Nas Reed for the right five minutes, he seems like he's just like, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2142.44s)]
*  I don't know, a five time All-Star. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2148.5600000000004s)]
*  And by the way, correction on me, I knew as soon as I said it, um, he was there [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2151.0800000000004s)]
*  before, so it was Gerson. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2154.44s)]
*  What was your winner? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2155.76s)]
*  Lawyers. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2157.0800000000004s)]
*  How come? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2158.6800000000003s)]
*  Lawyer fees for the Mark Laurie A-Rod Taylor fight. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2160.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, that's now going into round three. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2165.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2167.44s)]
*  They showed a rod a couple of times. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2168.28s)]
*  There's nothing more a rod than I guess it's actually strategically like the [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2171.4s)]
*  right move is if you're in this battle for this team that apparently you couldn't [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2175.0800000000004s)]
*  pay for, although it seems pretty nasty how it all goes, but it's a win. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2180.2000000000003s)]
*  It's pretty nasty how it all went down and it feels a bit like Taylor was like, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2184.72s)]
*  Hey, we're this good. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2188.64s)]
*  Well, I don't sell it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2190.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2191.2s)]
*  How can I get out of this? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2191.72s)]
*  So look, I've read everything on it and it's, it's, it did make me laugh a bit [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2192.48s)]
*  that I was like, there's nothing more a rod than just showing up and sitting [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2196.9199999999996s)]
*  courtside for all this stuff when it's in dispute, but that's actually probably [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2199.24s)]
*  the move that you do it. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2203.12s)]
*  And here we have both teams in the Western conference finals. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2205.44s)]
*  Cause like to think of Cuban of the time he sells it where I still can't quite [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2208.44s)]
*  get it out of my head. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2213.16s)]
*  I'm like, wait, he sold his team. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2213.96s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2215.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, a rod still a pretty big minority owner. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2217.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2221.7999999999997s)]
*  You're right. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2222.04s)]
*  I mean, I'm being unfair. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2222.44s)]
*  I'm being totally unfair. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2223.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think you're being unfair at all. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2225.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause it's still weird to see him there when it's every time you see him, you're [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2227.16s)]
*  like, Oh, lawsuit legal fight. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2230.64s)]
*  It's just like the reaction. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2233.44s)]
*  I think it would be way more fun if he hadn't won the 2000. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2235.52s)]
*  I mean, every part of life would be more fun if he hadn't won the 2009 [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2238.2799999999997s)]
*  world series and the Yankees hadn't won that year because then we would be able [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2242.68s)]
*  to do the whole, the Yankees haven't really won this century unless you count [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2246.24s)]
*  2000 as a year of the century, which is a big point of dispute, right? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFBrzn2CFg&t=2249.2s)]
