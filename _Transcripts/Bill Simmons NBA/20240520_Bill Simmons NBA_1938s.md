# What’s Next for the Knicks? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg)
*  the Pacers just crushed the Knicks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Where do you want to start? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1.6s)]
*  Indy greatest game seven shooting day [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=2.52s)]
*  in the history of basketball or [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=4.9s)]
*  devastated day for the Knicks franchise? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=7.44s)]
*  How about this? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=10.32s)]
*  I was expecting the Knicks to come back. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=11.32s)]
*  So the Celtics face the Knicks without Brunson [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=12.88s)]
*  with a broken hand. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=14.64s)]
*  I did have thought, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=15.76s)]
*  Birx made a shot and it got down to like 12. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=16.6s)]
*  I started getting ideas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=19.0s)]
*  I was like, this is great. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=20.28s)]
*  Imagine that happens. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Rossello, I give up trying to understand game sevens [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=25.0s)]
*  because this was the exact situation with a young team [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=28.14s)]
*  that we already saw look through in the headlights [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=31.38s)]
*  in game five. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=33.1s)]
*  And you figure MSG, crazy crowd, Knicks, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=33.92s)]
*  they're going to get all the calls. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  I thought for sure the Knicks were going to win. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=39.18s)]
*  I also thought OJ to Noby was going to be able to play 25, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=41.34s)]
*  30 minutes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=44.14s)]
*  I thought Hart was healthier than he looked in the game, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=45.56s)]
*  although he was given his best. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=47.82s)]
*  And Hartenstein was kind of a sneaky injury that I felt [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=49.14s)]
*  like the announcers didn't mention as much. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=51.42s)]
*  So it was a compromised Knicks team at the same time, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=54.22s)]
*  the shot making from the Pacers was from the get-go, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=57.02s)]
*  awesome. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  I think that's the best they can play. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=62.74s)]
*  And they did it in game seven in MSG. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=64.02000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they set a record or at least the last 50 years, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  Kirk Gouldsbury had the tweet out, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=69.08s)]
*  101 points through three quarters of a game seven, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=70.42s)]
*  most of the game seven in the last 50 years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  After the first quarter, they were at like 78%. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=75.54s)]
*  It actually went up to 81%. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  So they were 22 or 27. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=79.98s)]
*  Halliburton, who I was a little worried about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=82.06s)]
*  because of how bad he was in game five, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=84.5s)]
*  he took nine total shots and there were still two drives [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=86.18s)]
*  in the first quarter, specifically the second one [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=88.86s)]
*  where he was at the rim and he just pirouetted in the air [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=91.58s)]
*  and threw it out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=94.26s)]
*  So I'm like, whoa, dude, like what is going on with this? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  Because he had a couple of those plays in game five [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=98.1s)]
*  where I'm thinking, but that just means [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=99.84s)]
*  you're just not comfortable once you're inside the paint. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=101.66s)]
*  And if anything, just take it and see if you get fouled. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're their best player, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=106.7s)]
*  like you have to go aggressively there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=108.82s)]
*  And then he finishes the quarter with 15 points, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=110.92s)]
*  the Occam got off to a good start. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=112.98s)]
*  They couldn't miss. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=114.32s)]
*  So a huge credit to a team that I had no idea, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=115.54s)]
*  just like you, what to expect. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  I was probably leaning towards, I don't know, man, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=120.98s)]
*  some game five hangover stuff in there [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=123.54s)]
*  and it wasn't even close. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=125.26s)]
*  They were a completely different team. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I think in season tournament, stupid, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=128.66s)]
*  but big game exposure with a big crowd, big audience, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=132.66s)]
*  some pressure. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=136.1s)]
*  And then I think that game five really helped them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=137.22s)]
*  Watching this game today, how bad they were in game five [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=139.9s)]
*  and they just didn't understand how to play. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=142.54s)]
*  And they just didn't understand the urgency of the game. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=144.5s)]
*  And I thought Hal Burton, we talked about on this podcast, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=146.62s)]
*  was a little deer in the headlights. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=149.54s)]
*  Reading the stories about Carlisle coming out of that game, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=151.3s)]
*  how he hammered them, made them watch the tape, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  all the loose balls they didn't go after. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=157.58s)]
*  And I thought this was a great coaching job by him [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=160.06s)]
*  because they came out with a pace. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  He was clearly like, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=165.06s)]
*  you know if he's going to play, he's not going to be 100%. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=165.9s)]
*  Heart's not 100%, Brunson's banged up. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  Like, let's just go, press the pedal, go, go, go. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=170.82s)]
*  We're going to go out. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=173.58s)]
*  Let's go out like how we've played all year, which they did. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=174.5s)]
*  And then they started making shots. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned some of the, some of the, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  they'd scored 39 in the first quarter, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  which was the highest in a game seven since 1998. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=184.46s)]
*  At various points in the second quarter, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=187.78s)]
*  they were 22 for 27 and 29 for 38. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=189.46s)]
*  They finished halftime 21 for 26 from two [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=193.02s)]
*  and eight for 12 from three, 76% total. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=195.78s)]
*  It was the best playoff shooting half in 25 years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=198.78s)]
*  And then even end of the game, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  they finished at 67% Rassila. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=202.74s)]
*  I went back and I looked up the best game seven [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=205.78s)]
*  shooting percentages ever. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  The number one was Phoenix in, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=213.46s)]
*  doesn't say what year that is, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=217.5s)]
*  but it was 61% against the Lakers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=219.46s)]
*  OKC was at 60.9 and Boston against Atlanta in 88 at 60.8. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=223.02s)]
*  So nobody had even done 62% [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  and they did 67%. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=231.62s)]
*  Now some of that has to be the Knicks [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  where Precious and Chua playing a ton of minutes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=235.34s)]
*  Berks is out there a ton of minutes, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=239.86s)]
*  Hartenstein's compromised. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=241.62s)]
*  Like you could tell the Knicks weren't flying around, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=242.82000000000002s)]
*  but still like just from pure shot making, pretty crazy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=244.38000000000002s)]
*  Yeah and then TJ comes off the bench and makes everything [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=249.82000000000002s)]
*  and you can sit there and talk about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  like the offensive part of it for the Knicks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't bad. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=257.58000000000004s)]
*  It's not like their totals were necessarily bad [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=258.62s)]
*  at the halfway mark and Brunson was still around, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=260.5s)]
*  but we touched on it last week. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=262.34s)]
*  You're not usually gonna be successful [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=264.94s)]
*  as great as Brunson is and this is an incredible run [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=266.82s)]
*  and it's almost like in a storytelling version of it [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=269.73999999999995s)]
*  fitting that his hand broke [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=273.06s)]
*  because you couldn't keep asking this person [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=274.7s)]
*  to physically do this and carry this team. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=277.85999999999996s)]
*  His shooting hand broke too, even better [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  for the narrative, just for the narrative. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  It's important it was the left hand. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=284.7s)]
*  And just to understand too, like obviously I don't, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=286.17999999999995s)]
*  but if you were writing out some story [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=288.46s)]
*  and it's like, okay, he's gonna play so hard [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  that he actually breaks his shooting hand. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=292.78s)]
*  You're not really built, teams are not built to do this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=295.61999999999995s)]
*  and be successful in the playoffs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=300.73999999999995s)]
*  And that's what makes it this miraculous [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=302.78s)]
*  that we're even talking about a game seven [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=304.58s)]
*  and who knows if he's still out there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=306.02s)]
*  You know, a couple calls go their way. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=307.78s)]
*  They got two quick fouls. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=309.58s)]
*  The Pacers did at the beginning of the fourth quarter [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=310.9s)]
*  and I was like, oh, I actually meant to ask you, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  can we at like conspiracy bill, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  if we're going game seven, Nick Celtics love that market. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=317.58s)]
*  What happens, does this one not exist [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  as evidence that it doesn't happen? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=322.7s)]
*  I was banking on it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=326.02s)]
*  I thought for sure. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=327.74s)]
*  It's tough though, because when the Pacers [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=329.32s)]
*  are just making every shot they take, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=331.46s)]
*  I think it's tough to give some 50-50 calls [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=333.38s)]
*  to the other team. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=335.62s)]
*  It never really came into doubt [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=336.53999999999996s)]
*  because it was so clear so early on. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=338.26s)]
*  But yeah, conspiracy bill was very focused on that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=341.08s)]
*  I just like to keep track of the ones [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  where everybody will be like game seven, MSG, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=345.78000000000003s)]
*  Sunday afternoon, Boston, two markets. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=348.46s)]
*  And then it's like, oh yeah, the Pacers are now [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=351.74s)]
*  in the Eastern Conference Finals. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=354.98s)]
*  It's just weird too, because making the Brunson point [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=356.5s)]
*  of if they had come back and then the Celtics [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=360.06s)]
*  get the Knicks without Brunson, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=361.9s)]
*  it's like, okay, but on the other side too, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=363.5s)]
*  look what the Pacers have done. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=364.86s)]
*  They faced Milwaukee with no Yanis [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=366.52s)]
*  and Dame who missed two games. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=368.74s)]
*  OG who was a non-factor. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=370.66s)]
*  And you're right, when you saw him [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=373.14s)]
*  in the beginning of this game, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=375.5s)]
*  and I know OG takes, there's some stuff that came out [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=376.7s)]
*  when he had missed a bunch of games. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=379.58s)]
*  It's like he's in no hurry when he's like 50-50 [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  to come back and play. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=383.5s)]
*  So you're like, is he really gonna do that? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=385.02s)]
*  When he came out, you're like, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=387.14s)]
*  okay, this guy is really hurt. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=387.97999999999996s)]
*  He made a couple shots and then they showed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=390.74s)]
*  that wide shot from behind the basket [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=392.74s)]
*  of him being unable to shoot over on an open three [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  when the Pacers had transition and it made it 16-10. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  I wrote it down because I was like, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=402.06s)]
*  oh, he can't even jog to the right spot. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=403.78s)]
*  He was just incapable of quick burst for eight feet. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  And that was when he knew he wasn't coming back. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=410.94s)]
*  Yeah, him making the second shot was all I needed to see. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=413.14s)]
*  Because he took this Hail Mary shot [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=417.61999999999995s)]
*  because he actually couldn't get into his shooting pocket [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  or whatever he wanted to do from that spot. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=423.34s)]
*  It's like, I might as well just go straight up [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  and turn around and see if this goes in. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=426.82s)]
*  And then you watch him off the ball [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=428.78s)]
*  and then they subbed him out right there at six minutes [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=430.05999999999995s)]
*  to never see him again. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=432.82s)]
*  So, time out, came back. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=434.62s)]
*  When I mentioned the hottest shooting teams ever, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=436.70000000000005s)]
*  it was the 06 Suns who had the record. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=438.94s)]
*  The 2014 OKC, which was that great Durant team [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=442.38000000000005s)]
*  that really probably could have made the finals. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=446.26000000000005s)]
*  And then the 88 Celtics, the last Bird, McHale run. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=448.82000000000005s)]
*  And then the 05 Suns. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=452.98s)]
*  So two of the top four were Nash Suns teams, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=454.98s)]
*  which the Pacers play a little bit like. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=459.62s)]
*  I was so impressed by Hal Bern in this game. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=461.78000000000003s)]
*  I noticed the same thing you did when he kicked it out, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=463.82s)]
*  that maybe the second time I was like, oh. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=465.98s)]
*  It was the second one. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  If they can come back, maybe he'll get tight. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=470.86s)]
*  But he went the other way. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=473.62s)]
*  He started talking shit. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=475.54s)]
*  When the guys start talking shit, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=476.94s)]
*  now Tyson Fury is an example the other way [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=478.94s)]
*  of he was talking shit and then he got absolutely tagged [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=481.14000000000004s)]
*  and all of a sudden he was talking no more shit. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=484.1s)]
*  But Hal Bern as this game was going, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=485.98s)]
*  once he started talking to the courtside guys, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=488.22s)]
*  I was like, okay, he's good. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=489.94s)]
*  I don't know what happened to him in game five. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=491.98s)]
*  I don't understand it, but it's water under the bridge now. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=493.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think development wise for him, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=497.14s)]
*  comfort level, I know we'll get to it, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=501.06s)]
*  but I look at SGA differently [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=503.3s)]
*  even though they lost that series. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=505.3s)]
*  I look at SGA differently now and it's a huge compliment. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=506.78s)]
*  And for Hal Bern in this series, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=510.62s)]
*  I know there's just been a lot that's gone on [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=513.54s)]
*  in his story for 23, 24. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=515.38s)]
*  But as I was kind of walking around today, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=517.9s)]
*  thinking about this game, I'm just going, I don't know. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=521.34s)]
*  I was like, man, I hope I don't see that again. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=523.1s)]
*  I hope I don't see him on the road. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=525.38s)]
*  But they came out and they didn't miss any shots. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=526.6600000000001s)]
*  So all of it was easy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  It was never a point. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=530.5s)]
*  They got it to six at one point and I went, oh. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=534.34s)]
*  And then just like that, it's another eight-oh run. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=537.7800000000001s)]
*  So there was never, Dallas and OKC had these extended [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=540.46s)]
*  stretches of those games because it was so tough at times [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=543.74s)]
*  where it was like, oh, it's eight points. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=546.74s)]
*  And then it felt like three days went by [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  and it's like now it's six points. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=549.9s)]
*  This game had two maybe moments and if they were fires, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=552.02s)]
*  they were immediately extinguished. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=556.9s)]
*  The big moment midway through third quarter, 77-70, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=559.54s)]
*  Nick's got to stop with a little over six minutes left. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  Deuce had the cross court pass turnover. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  Miles Turner three, back up to 10. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=569.14s)]
*  Brunson turnover, Ty Reese layup. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=571.78s)]
*  Five second violation bringing the ball back in. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=574.5s)]
*  Knee Smith layup, it was 84-70 in under a minute. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=577.26s)]
*  And that was the next chance [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=580.4200000000001s)]
*  because the crowd was getting back into it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=581.74s)]
*  And I wanted to see the Pacers put in a position of, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=584.26s)]
*  okay, you guys are going to get tight here. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=586.38s)]
*  And it went the other way and they were awesome. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=587.74s)]
*  There was one point, my buddy Hench texted me, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=590.34s)]
*  Knee Smith, Numhart and McConnell were 17 for 18 shooting [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=592.74s)]
*  at one point in the fourth quarter. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=597.26s)]
*  When your bench is doing that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  One of the things I liked about this Pacers team [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=600.7s)]
*  was that when McConnell, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=603.58s)]
*  McConnell's like the rare bench guy that comes in [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=604.74s)]
*  and just could not be less afraid [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=607.38s)]
*  and kind of relished the moment. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=609.1800000000001s)]
*  But it was nice to see my guy Knee Smith, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=611.38s)]
*  who Brian Barrett texted me and was like, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=613.86s)]
*  boy, it would have been nice if Knee Smith [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=615.82s)]
*  played in the 2022 finals. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=617.22s)]
*  Still a sore spot for the stealth loser Celtic fans [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=620.1800000000001s)]
*  like me and Brian Barrett. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=624.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a big- [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=626.4200000000001s)]
*  Emay buried Knee Smith. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=627.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=628.1s)]
*  That's kind of a big assumption. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=628.94s)]
*  Knee Smith was going to be the difference [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=629.86s)]
*  against the Warriors two years ago. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=631.0200000000001s)]
*  No, just saying, just saying. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=632.1400000000001s)]
*  It reminded me that they couldn't get him off the bench. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=633.7s)]
*  It was a fair point. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=637.1s)]
*  Think about that exercise though. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=639.22s)]
*  You're projecting- [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=641.26s)]
*  This is what I knew at losses, Russelo. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=642.1s)]
*  Don't take this away from me. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=643.58s)]
*  You get 24 Knee Smith, who up until, I don't know, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=645.58s)]
*  I mean, it felt like for a week plus, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=648.5400000000001s)]
*  I was like, yeah, what happened to this guy's shooting? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=650.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=652.98s)]
*  And I think he watches Tom Amanski fouling videos, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=653.82s)]
*  but they're put up by Kat. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=657.1s)]
*  So it's like Kat Amanski. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=658.98s)]
*  This is off season. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=661.5400000000001s)]
*  New from Tom Amanski and Carl Anthony Towns. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=662.38s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=664.3000000000001s)]
*  How to always be in foul trouble. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=665.3s)]
*  So yeah, whatever. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=667.34s)]
*  But he was good. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=670.38s)]
*  He was really, really good. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=671.22s)]
*  He started seven at seven. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=672.3s)]
*  So what else can you ask for him? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=673.78s)]
*  On top of, there was some clear, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=675.7s)]
*  there was two big coaching things throughout this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=678.06s)]
*  where you were like, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=680.06s)]
*  how come they can't get Burks a few minutes? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=681.26s)]
*  And clearly, I don't know if the series goes the other way, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=683.14s)]
*  if Tibbs is willing to trust a guy [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=685.9399999999999s)]
*  who actually has been around, is a consummate pro. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=687.42s)]
*  I had another team texting me while it was happening [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=690.38s)]
*  being like, what the fuck? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  This is stupid. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=695.74s)]
*  And if you know anything about Burks, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=697.42s)]
*  he's been around enough that he's not gonna freak out. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=699.42s)]
*  I mean, as much as I love Miles McBride, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=703.1s)]
*  he had a layup attempt today where we were like, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=704.66s)]
*  dude, have you not looked in the mirror? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=706.1s)]
*  He weren't gonna finish this layup at any point. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=708.7s)]
*  So it's hard to really point to anything [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=712.22s)]
*  other than when the other team's shooting like that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=715.62s)]
*  and Brunson goes down, what did anybody expect? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=718.58s)]
*  Burks has one of those jump shots [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=721.66s)]
*  that he's like the guy in Pick Up [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=723.58s)]
*  where you just can't believe it's going in. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=726.82s)]
*  There's just no arc at all. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=729.22s)]
*  It never goes in clean. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=730.7s)]
*  It hits like two, three parts of the rim. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=731.94s)]
*  But when he started making it, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=733.62s)]
*  he made a couple of those in the second quarter [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=734.74s)]
*  and it was exactly what the Knicks needed. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=736.7s)]
*  The Knicks got to 55 points in the first half, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=738.46s)]
*  which is kind of a nutty total when you think, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=741.9000000000001s)]
*  no Randall, barely any OG. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=744.46s)]
*  Hardenstein wasn't getting any offensive rebounds. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=746.74s)]
*  But going back, big picture for the series though. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=750.62s)]
*  Like if I'm a Knicks fan, I'm torturing myself [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=754.5400000000001s)]
*  about all the ways that God hated us basically. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=756.6600000000001s)]
*  The Nemhard game three, three is the first thing [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna think of when I think back at that series [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=765.0600000000001s)]
*  because they could have been up three nothing. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=767.1s)]
*  That three was ridiculous. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=768.9000000000001s)]
*  The whole play broke down. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=770.82s)]
*  He was 31 feet from the basket. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=772.34s)]
*  He lost the ball. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=773.7800000000001s)]
*  He was one for six for the game. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=774.94s)]
*  Nobody in the arena, literally not one person [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=777.14s)]
*  wanted him to take it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=779.46s)]
*  He made it and Hal Burton put his hands over on his head, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=780.62s)]
*  walking to the bench like Thomas Hill, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=784.82s)]
*  Thomas Hill Christian Leightner game style. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=788.7s)]
*  Just in disbelief that it went in. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=791.22s)]
*  And if it doesn't go in, I think the Knicks win, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=793.82s)]
*  they go up three nothing for the series [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=795.58s)]
*  and no team in the history of basketball [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=797.22s)]
*  has blown a three nothing lead. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=799.0600000000001s)]
*  So to me, it starts with the Nemhard three. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=800.42s)]
*  The no show in game five was weirdly important [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=803.58s)]
*  because it allowed Carlisle to basically [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=806.7s)]
*  kick them in the ass. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=808.54s)]
*  And then OG starting and not being able to move [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=809.58s)]
*  I think was big. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=812.86s)]
*  In retrospect, I wonder, do you think they should have [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=814.18s)]
*  maybe brought him off the bench, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=816.74s)]
*  used him as like this lurking boogie man [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=818.74s)]
*  that you don't know where you're gonna get? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=821.22s)]
*  Because it was one of those things where they started him [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=822.42s)]
*  and within six minutes, like, okay, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=825.06s)]
*  well, he's not gonna be a factor. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=826.42s)]
*  My guess would be whatever stuff they do pregame [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=828.58s)]
*  to get him ready, then they don't want him [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=831.5s)]
*  sitting on the bench for six minutes. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=832.98s)]
*  You have to get him going. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=834.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=835.18s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=836.18s)]
*  He couldn't move. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=837.98s)]
*  I mean, there was a cut off the ball [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=839.26s)]
*  and then there was another three [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=841.26s)]
*  where the one cut, he was screened, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=842.98s)]
*  but he just was stuck. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=845.74s)]
*  And then the other close, I mean, look, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=847.5s)]
*  everybody watched it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=849.3s)]
*  I think he deserves credit for even trying to get out there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=850.8199999999999s)]
*  Can we do the big picture on the Knicks fan base? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=854.06s)]
*  This was the most beloved Knicks team [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=857.78s)]
*  since the Canby team. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=859.46s)]
*  And then you think like, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=861.78s)]
*  I don't remember another basketball team [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=863.06s)]
*  just getting decimated like this [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=865.1s)]
*  as the playoffs were happening. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=866.5s)]
*  Pretty unusual. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=868.3800000000001s)]
*  Like you lose Randall, you lose Mitch, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=869.58s)]
*  you lose Bogdanovich out of nowhere. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=873.9000000000001s)]
*  OG gets hurt. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=877.2600000000001s)]
*  Hart in game six, who was like kind of one [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=878.7s)]
*  of their superpower guys, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=880.9000000000001s)]
*  because he would just play 48 minutes a game [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=882.1s)]
*  and it was like, oh no, he's fine. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=883.7800000000001s)]
*  No, Tibs, these guys, they're just conditioned to do this. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=885.0200000000001s)]
*  Then he goes out. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=887.94s)]
*  Deep Vincenzo was the only one who didn't get hurt, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=890.2600000000001s)]
*  but I just think if you're a Knicks fan, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=893.66s)]
*  small picture, that sucks. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=897.26s)]
*  Thought we had a chance to play Boston. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=899.4599999999999s)]
*  Big picture, the way the East was set [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=901.74s)]
*  with all the injuries you mentioned earlier, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=903.62s)]
*  you're probably not gonna get a better chance [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=906.02s)]
*  with this unit unless you make a trade, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=907.66s)]
*  unless you can add a big ass piece to what you already have [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=910.02s)]
*  or some sort of substantial piece, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=913.9399999999999s)]
*  because next year the East is gonna be better [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=915.6999999999999s)]
*  and I don't think this team has constituted, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=917.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's realistic. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=920.3399999999999s)]
*  The overachiever team is gonna be [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=921.94s)]
*  probably less of a successful gimmick next year. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=925.86s)]
*  Orlando will be a year older, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=928.1800000000001s)]
*  the Celtics will be just as good, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=929.82s)]
*  Milwaukee will be back, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=931.3000000000001s)]
*  Philly will be different, but not what they were this year, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=932.78s)]
*  and they're gonna have to do something basically. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=937.74s)]
*  We talk about this a lot, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=941.5s)]
*  and I do think it's a good exercise [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=942.66s)]
*  of how far a team makes it and then just like, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=944.14s)]
*  okay, is that who you think you are? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=946.3000000000001s)]
*  Maybe Dallas getting there for a second time in three years [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=947.9s)]
*  puts more stock into them making [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=950.9s)]
*  the Western Conference Finals a couple years ago, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=952.46s)]
*  and they beat a Phoenix team that on paper [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=954.1800000000001s)]
*  was statistically better than the team [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=956.1s)]
*  that had been in the finals a year before, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=957.3000000000001s)]
*  and they just humiliated them and took their souls, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=959.22s)]
*  and the thing's never been the same since, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=963.1800000000001s)]
*  but if you're thinking about the four or five best teams, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=964.66s)]
*  I don't know that any of us really had Dallas in that group, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=968.34s)]
*  but now you look at what they did this year [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=970.9s)]
*  and you're like, this feels way more real [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=973.1s)]
*  as a Western Conference Finals participant, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=974.94s)]
*  so that depending on which way it goes, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=977.1s)]
*  depending on who you get, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=979.3s)]
*  feeling really good about their chances [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=981.02s)]
*  no matter who they play against [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=982.62s)]
*  just because they have a lot of pieces [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=983.78s)]
*  and it's all come together, the defense has been better. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=986.18s)]
*  It's like going into next year, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=988.38s)]
*  I'll think about Dallas differently. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=989.7s)]
*  With this year on the other side of the Boston line, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=991.98s)]
*  I don't know what I would have thought about the Knicks. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=994.22s)]
*  Well, I guess I could tell you [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=997.5s)]
*  what I would have thought about the Knicks and Pacers [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=998.38s)]
*  is that this was a mess. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1000.14s)]
*  It's a mess of a conference, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1002.86s)]
*  and Boston's gonna have all of this time off, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1005.66s)]
*  and their starters are rarely gonna have played together [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1009.66s)]
*  throughout all of this time, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1012.4200000000001s)]
*  and we know the standards that they're held to, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1014.4200000000001s)]
*  but do you look at the Knicks differently [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1016.54s)]
*  going into next year? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1019.86s)]
*  Will you look at the Pacers? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1020.82s)]
*  Now granted, who knows? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1021.74s)]
*  Maybe the Pacers shock the world here and take the East, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1022.74s)]
*  but based on what we've seen so far, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1025.74s)]
*  it just was kind of last man standing, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  and I'm not sure how much that'll change [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1030.94s)]
*  my ceiling thoughts on some of these teams. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1034.02s)]
*  One thing that's cool, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1036.58s)]
*  and I don't know why teams don't do this more often [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1037.78s)]
*  when they're at least in the vicinity, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1040.62s)]
*  was they made that Siakam trade, right? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1043.78s)]
*  And they gave up a pick, and they gave up some stuff, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1045.6599999999999s)]
*  and it was like, okay, that's fun. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1048.5s)]
*  They're pretty good now. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1051.42s)]
*  They could potentially sign him long-term [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1052.6599999999999s)]
*  and make him one of their three best players. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1054.46s)]
*  He was really good in the game today, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1057.02s)]
*  especially the first quarter. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1058.62s)]
*  I thought he had real purpose [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1060.5s)]
*  and was trying to punish whatever the matchup was, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1062.22s)]
*  and in general, has been in some big games [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1065.26s)]
*  from his Raptors days, and he was the one guy they had, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1068.18s)]
*  unless you're gonna say T.J. McConnell, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1071.42s)]
*  who had at least been in some games [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1073.82s)]
*  where the hair in your arms are gonna go up. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1075.82s)]
*  But I look back at that trade, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1079.34s)]
*  and I feel like a lot of teams could add Siakam, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1080.74s)]
*  and a lot of teams talked themselves out of it [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1083.78s)]
*  for a variety of reasons, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1086.26s)]
*  I don't even know really who else was in that mix, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1087.74s)]
*  and then he was like, fuck it, we'll go get him, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1089.58s)]
*  and he's a top 60 guy, and he played really well today, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1091.74s)]
*  and it makes me think, if they're being aggressive like that, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1094.46s)]
*  I would expect them to keep staying aggressive, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1098.14s)]
*  whereas what does Cleveland do? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1100.54s)]
*  Cleveland, to me, is the, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1104.66s)]
*  I don't know what's gonna happen with him. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1107.8200000000002s)]
*  It seems like Jared Allen's gonna get traded, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1109.26s)]
*  and it seems like Mitchell's gonna get traded, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1111.02s)]
*  and they'll rebuild around Garland, Mobley, their shooters, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1112.5800000000002s)]
*  and then whatever they get back in those trades, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1116.3000000000002s)]
*  but that's a wild-card team, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1118.74s)]
*  and I think Orlando's a wild-card team to me in the East. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1119.8600000000001s)]
*  And I just assume the Knicks [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1123.18s)]
*  are gonna go all in on somebody. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1124.46s)]
*  Orlando will have to be better. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1128.1000000000001s)]
*  Like, I would just be shocked if Orlando isn't better. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1129.46s)]
*  I don't think Franz is gonna be just a bad shooter [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1131.26s)]
*  all of a sudden. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1132.98s)]
*  I think this year, I'm not telling you, he's staff, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1133.98s)]
*  but they have the cap space. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1137.5s)]
*  They'll probably overpay somebody and get aggressive [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1138.6200000000001s)]
*  just to go ahead and add him. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1140.18s)]
*  Cleveland has to break up the Mobley-Allen thing. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1141.5s)]
*  They have to, and I don't know if it's a bit of fool's gold. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1143.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, and it sounds like the Garland-Mitchell thing, too, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1146.54s)]
*  if the reports were correct, that Clutch was basically like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1148.7s)]
*  if Mitchell's staying, you gotta trade Garland. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1151.62s)]
*  Publish report. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1155.46s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, you're right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1156.58s)]
*  I'm just trying to think, like, what would you rather do, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1157.78s)]
*  keep Garland or Mitchell? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1160.06s)]
*  I would trade, I would keep Garland and Mobley, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1163.1399999999999s)]
*  and I think Allen has real value, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1165.3799999999999s)]
*  that they could get a real piece back and maybe even a pick, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1167.46s)]
*  and then I would trade Mitchell [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1172.8999999999999s)]
*  because I don't think he's gonna stay. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1174.26s)]
*  I just wouldn't believe him. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1176.1s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna stay. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1178.78s)]
*  So if he said, hey, I'll do the extension, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1180.3s)]
*  you'd be like, okay, but what does that mean? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1181.86s)]
*  We're just gonna do this year from now. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1183.58s)]
*  Because he said that, though. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1184.42s)]
*  He has not said that yet. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1185.54s)]
*  No, he hasn't said it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1187.02s)]
*  I'm just saying, like, what if he came to you and said, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1187.9s)]
*  okay, fine, I'll do the extension? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  Would you be like, okay. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1192.26s)]
*  Under the Ryan Marcillo rule of, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1193.9s)]
*  they're gonna do the extension, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1195.62s)]
*  and then a year later be like, get the fuck out of here. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1196.94s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know if I would trust it. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1199.06s)]
*  I just have to see what those other, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1202.74s)]
*  like, we're all in love with trading all these guys, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1203.98s)]
*  but I wanna get back to your original thing on Sialkin [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1206.1s)]
*  because I think it's worth diving into a little bit more. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1207.8999999999999s)]
*  When the trade first happened, I was like, okay, well, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1210.26s)]
*  do you know that you're keeping him? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1212.2199999999998s)]
*  And the word was they knew that they were keeping him. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1213.8999999999999s)]
*  So then when you look at the pieces, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1216.02s)]
*  you're like, okay, that's kind of a no-brainer. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1217.3s)]
*  I mean, I haven't always been the biggest Sialkin fan [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1219.1s)]
*  because I think one year I had him, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1221.2199999999998s)]
*  like, it may have been him, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1224.3799999999999s)]
*  and actually Donovan Mitchell was like the last spot [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1225.9399999999998s)]
*  for an all-MBA team. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1228.9799999999998s)]
*  But that's still, even like, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1230.5s)]
*  whatever you think is wrong with Mitchell [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1232.54s)]
*  or whatever you think the limitations are for Sialkin [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1234.1s)]
*  of closing a big playoff game, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1236.5s)]
*  I think the franchise, maybe it's probably fan base [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1239.42s)]
*  is even more than franchises is just, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1241.82s)]
*  okay, well, who do you want? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1244.62s)]
*  Like, you want somebody in the seven to eight range? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1246.26s)]
*  You want somebody who's a top 10 player? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1249.18s)]
*  So if you're the Pacers, you go, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1251.5s)]
*  hey, we'll never probably get Sialkin in free agency, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1253.26s)]
*  so let's just go ahead and do this now [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1255.9s)]
*  and let's figure out if he's happy with our place [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1258.06s)]
*  and wants to sign here. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1261.54s)]
*  And the price really isn't that bad. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1263.02s)]
*  I don't think teams get enough credit [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1264.58s)]
*  for being way more practical [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1266.1s)]
*  about the kind of player they can bring in. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1268.94s)]
*  And if you're Indiana, that's probably the best you would do. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1271.3s)]
*  I think we talked about this when it happened. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1276.86s)]
*  There's 30 teams in the league, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1278.74s)]
*  which means there's 60 top two player spots, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1280.3s)]
*  which means you want to at least have two in the top 60. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1283.58s)]
*  Like, we do this Ringer 100 exercise that we vote on, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1287.3799999999999s)]
*  and I think we did the last vote in April. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1291.26s)]
*  I think we had Sialkin as the 41st best player in the league. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1292.98s)]
*  And there's no context other than just rank the players. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1296.3400000000001s)]
*  Right now, who do you think are the best players? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1301.22s)]
*  So they had number 41 and I had Halliburton at number 20. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1303.46s)]
*  So they have two of the top 45. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1308.74s)]
*  Then you get some luck in the conference. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1311.9s)]
*  Then you get your bench to show up. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1313.9s)]
*  Then you have a really good coach [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1315.74s)]
*  and all of a sudden you're in round three. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1316.98s)]
*  I think the one thing we've maybe learned from this year [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1318.74s)]
*  is that there's so much talent now [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1321.22s)]
*  that you can maybe sneak into round three. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1323.38s)]
*  We're gonna go through some of the stuff Dallas did [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1325.98s)]
*  that I didn't agree with half of it. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1328.26s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1330.58s)]
*  They had Luca, they leveraged a bunch of different assets, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1331.46s)]
*  and now they're two rounds away from winning the finals. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1334.22s)]
*  So yeah, when you look at the big list [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1337.1000000000001s)]
*  and you think like the guys I had after Sialkin [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1340.02s)]
*  were Jared Allen, Brandon Ingram, Trey Young, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1343.18s)]
*  Jaylen Green, Scotty Barnes, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1345.82s)]
*  Darius Garland, DeRozan, Shen Goon, Drew Holiday. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1348.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, and then you get into the 70s, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1353.34s)]
*  all of a sudden you're looking at Grayson Allen [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1354.78s)]
*  and Terry Roger and Jada McDaniels, like it drops fast. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1357.26s)]
*  You know, so I like that they did it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1361.2199999999998s)]
*  I think they deserve a lot of credit [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1362.58s)]
*  for how they built the team. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1363.9799999999998s)]
*  They didn't do that Turner Heel trade [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1365.54s)]
*  and when everyone was trying to bully them [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1367.1399999999999s)]
*  into trading them, those two guys for the two firsts, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1370.74s)]
*  they made a really smart Halliburton trade. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1374.6599999999999s)]
*  The knee Smith, like getting knee Smith for Brogdon, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1377.78s)]
*  that worked out. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1380.26s)]
*  A lot of their stuff worked out. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1381.1s)]
*  They could have traded TJ McConnell at any point this season [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1382.1399999999999s)]
*  to a team that needed a point guard that kept them. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1384.8999999999999s)]
*  So they did a good job. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1387.86s)]
*  And I thought Carlisle was outstanding in this series. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1389.02s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't love how Lady went from Nimhart to knee Smith [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1392.54s)]
*  because I just felt like it was obvious against Brunson. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1396.46s)]
*  But at least he fixed stuff that wasn't working. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1397.8999999999999s)]
*  Like we'll see some coaches like just stubbornly be like, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1400.26s)]
*  nope, this is what we do. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1402.98s)]
*  Like I like how he fixed six and seven. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1405.06s)]
*  Yeah, you're right though, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1407.9399999999998s)]
*  because Turner was weird because he was available forever. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1410.02s)]
*  And then forever. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1412.6599999999999s)]
*  Because I remember when the Celtics had the Hayward [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1414.5s)]
*  like sign and trade possibilities, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1416.74s)]
*  there was like, okay, well, if it were to Pacers, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1419.3s)]
*  because there was some interest there, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1421.5s)]
*  like can Turner then be flipped somewhere else? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1423.06s)]
*  And then it was like, yeah, the trade market for him [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1426.58s)]
*  isn't really that good. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1428.9399999999998s)]
*  So they didn't just want to give them away. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1430.4599999999998s)]
*  And look, they've done this without Matherin, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1431.8999999999999s)]
*  who I know is probably a little too single-minded at times. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1433.9s)]
*  But man, like if you need somebody to come off the bench. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1438.14s)]
*  He's a rational confidence guy [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1441.7s)]
*  who would have helped in a game like today. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1443.18s)]
*  Yeah, because if you had other guys, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1445.26s)]
*  like Siakam comes out in the third quarter [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1446.98s)]
*  and misses everything, which I think is still, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1448.5s)]
*  I think he can be a little predictable [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1451.3000000000002s)]
*  with the way you have to defend him. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1453.3400000000001s)]
*  And if OG had been healthy, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1455.0600000000002s)]
*  then I think the Siakam story is a little different, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1457.14s)]
*  even if I like ultimately the trade [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1458.98s)]
*  for all the reasons that we just brought up. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1460.5s)]
*  I thought it was really interesting that Kula Bali [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1462.1399999999999s)]
*  was like, oh, he's easy to defend. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1464.6599999999999s)]
*  And I was like, oh, wow. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1466.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, maybe I'm- [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1467.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that was one of the rare, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1468.78s)]
*  interesting player podcastings. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1469.62s)]
*  Let's flip it forward to the Pacers [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1471.3799999999999s)]
*  who are now somehow in the Final Four playing the Celtics. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1473.74s)]
*  Looks like we're not gonna get poor Zingas [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1478.1799999999998s)]
*  for about two games. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1479.98s)]
*  I really, who do you think the Celtics were rooting for [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1481.3799999999999s)]
*  by the time we got to game seven, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1483.3s)]
*  knowing Ananobe wasn't healthy, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1485.1s)]
*  knowing Hartenstein was banged up, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1487.4599999999998s)]
*  knowing Brunson was banged up. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1488.98s)]
*  I mean, come on, Brunson breaks his hand? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1491.06s)]
*  Are you saying before we knew that? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1493.06s)]
*  No, I'm saying before game seven. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1493.8999999999999s)]
*  I still think it's the Knicks. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1496.02s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1500.6599999999999s)]
*  I think this team looked worn out, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1501.6599999999999s)]
*  which is understandable. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1506.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1509.34s)]
*  Well, when you're playing at the pace they played, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1510.5s)]
*  just to pull out that Philly series, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1512.4199999999998s)]
*  and then just to be in even the position [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1514.5s)]
*  to be in game seven in Indiana, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1516.1799999999998s)]
*  plus everything they did the second half of the year. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1517.62s)]
*  And based on just ball movement alone, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1520.5s)]
*  if you're defensively Boston going, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1523.3s)]
*  hey, we have more big guys to throw at Brunson, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1525.98s)]
*  we can go Drew, we can go Brown, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1528.26s)]
*  we can even go some white Tatum, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1530.42s)]
*  like we can, and then Hauser will come in [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1532.46s)]
*  and get switched to him twice, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1535.06s)]
*  and he won't get past Hauser for the two times, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1536.26s)]
*  and everybody's like, oh, that's right, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1538.18s)]
*  he doesn't suck on defense. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1539.14s)]
*  So it would have to be New York. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1540.54s)]
*  I would rather play a team that is great as Brunson is, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1542.9s)]
*  say this guy's taking 30 shots a game. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1547.02s)]
*  Okay, well let's see what happens. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1549.06s)]
*  They've been on this physical grinded out pace now [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1550.98s)]
*  for a couple weeks, because at least, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1553.3799999999999s)]
*  like the pacers, you have to be locked in. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1555.46s)]
*  They swing the ball, they move, the guys drive, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1558.34s)]
*  and there's a lot about their offense that I like, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1560.9s)]
*  and there's not really a zero out there offensively. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1564.3s)]
*  I was texting with Doc Rivers about them, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1568.42s)]
*  and he was saying they were the best team in the league [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1570.26s)]
*  at defending the first half of the court [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1575.0s)]
*  before you get into your offense. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1577.3s)]
*  And he said this before the next game, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1579.38s)]
*  because he thought they were gonna give Brunson trouble [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1581.22s)]
*  just putting miles on him as he brought the ball up. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1583.6200000000001s)]
*  And I thought they got better at that [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1586.94s)]
*  as the series went along. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1589.98s)]
*  By the time we got to game seven, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1590.98s)]
*  even before Brunson got hurt, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1592.3400000000001s)]
*  they were harassing him before he got the ball, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1594.3400000000001s)]
*  they were harassing him as he dribbled the ball up. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1596.66s)]
*  Turner would come up to mid-court basically to double him, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1598.82s)]
*  so he had to think about that, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1602.46s)]
*  and it felt like over and over again, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1604.1000000000001s)]
*  they weren't even in their offense [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1605.54s)]
*  before they got to game 14, second mark. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1607.1799999999998s)]
*  And it's the kind of stuff that Celtics [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1608.6599999999999s)]
*  seem to take three, four games in a series [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1611.86s)]
*  to even figure out how to do little wrinkles like that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1615.62s)]
*  So we'll see if they can do it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1618.3s)]
*  Before we get Celtics Pacers, big picture on the Knicks. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1619.9399999999998s)]
*  They have the 24th and 25th pick this draft. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1623.62s)]
*  They have all their own firsts. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1627.0s)]
*  They have a top 13 protected Detroit firsts [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1629.02s)]
*  that the protection just dropped [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1631.62s)]
*  for the next three years after that. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1633.3799999999999s)]
*  They have a top 10 protected Washington first [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1635.26s)]
*  that drops to a top eight in 26, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1637.14s)]
*  and they have a Milwaukee first [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1638.94s)]
*  that's one through four protected. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1640.18s)]
*  So they have the ability with the Bogdanovich contract, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1642.22s)]
*  they can team option that, put 20 million on that, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1644.8600000000001s)]
*  they can add contracts to it, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1647.06s)]
*  they can get nuts and put Randall in there. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1648.74s)]
*  They have a lot of options, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1650.58s)]
*  and I really think they're gonna get [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1652.6000000000001s)]
*  Mikhail Bridges as the big target. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1654.22s)]
*  I think that's who they want. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1656.88s)]
*  I think they're gonna try to overpay [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1658.74s)]
*  because I think they want those [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1660.98s)]
*  four Villanova guys together, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1662.0s)]
*  and I don't think they want a major star. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1663.62s)]
*  I think they want somebody like that. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1665.4199999999998s)]
*  So that would be my prediction. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1667.1s)]
*  Who else do you think they would potentially pursue? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1668.58s)]
*  I just do think the Nets would do that with New York. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1672.98s)]
*  I think if it's a 120 cents on the dollar, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1677.78s)]
*  I just don't know why you want Mikhail Bridges [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1681.34s)]
*  if you're going nowhere. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1683.26s)]
*  That's a guy who should be on a good team, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1684.54s)]
*  and on a team like that, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1686.22s)]
*  unless you feel like you can get Mitchell or Devin Booker, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1687.6999999999998s)]
*  they're not getting Devin Booker. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1692.1799999999998s)]
*  They're not, now you start talking yourself [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1693.62s)]
*  into Brandon Ingram and people like that, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1695.86s)]
*  which is not gonna take you very far. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1697.62s)]
*  If I were them, I would trade Bridges [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1699.9399999999998s)]
*  for more than he's worth, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1701.98s)]
*  and just start over with my Phoenix picks [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1703.54s)]
*  and whatever I got with the next thing. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1705.34s)]
*  But that's just me. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1706.54s)]
*  Do you think the 27 unprotected Phoenix pick [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1710.26s)]
*  is more valuable today [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1712.58s)]
*  than the number one pick Atlanta has in 24? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1713.9399999999998s)]
*  Why do you ask? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1717.5600000000002s)]
*  I just was looking at different trade stuff [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1720.8400000000001s)]
*  for Atlanta's pick, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1722.8400000000001s)]
*  which is always an interesting exercise. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1725.0800000000002s)]
*  Because I think no matter how, however you do it, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1727.72s)]
*  I always suck when I do them with you too, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1730.2s)]
*  and I almost want to apologize after we tape them, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1731.8s)]
*  because you have more fun with it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1734.28s)]
*  And then as I work my way half through the fake trades, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1735.72s)]
*  I'm like, that's stupid. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1737.76s)]
*  Nobody would do that. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  I like it though, you're a glass half empty trade idea guy, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1740.2s)]
*  and I'm a glass half empty trade idea guy, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1743.16s)]
*  and I'm a trade idea guy, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1745.28s)]
*  and I'm a glass half full trade idea guy. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1746.24s)]
*  That's why we work so well with those. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1748.12s)]
*  You're just like, nah, they won't do that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1749.8s)]
*  Nah, why would they do that? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1751.28s)]
*  And I'm like, no, no, here's why they might do it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1752.48s)]
*  I'm a glass overboard in a rowboat with no sail, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1754.92s)]
*  lost at sea. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1759.76s)]
*  I don't know that the, well, first of all, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1769.0s)]
*  I think the New York Brooklyn thing [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1771.24s)]
*  is something you have to think about. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1773.28s)]
*  And Bridges is awesome. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1775.4s)]
*  I would love to have Bridges. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  I think his decline this year was like, all right, cool. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1778.6s)]
*  You guys want to have Cam Thomas take a million shots? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1782.0s)]
*  Like, all right, whatever. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1785.36s)]
*  And when I thought about the Mitchell stuff with the Knicks, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1787.72s)]
*  all the things in life that you want that you don't get [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1791.44s)]
*  and you should be happy, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1793.6s)]
*  it just felt like they were finally going to get Mitchell. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1795.0s)]
*  They didn't believe that there was another suitor. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1796.96s)]
*  Cleveland comes in and it's like, wait, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1799.08s)]
*  somebody else wanted him. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1800.76s)]
*  And then it opens up this Brunson story where it's like, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1802.36s)]
*  well, that would have never happened, okay? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1805.08s)]
*  The most beloved Knick since the 90s guys, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1807.8s)]
*  some would argue even more so, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  which I think is a little aggressive. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1811.96s)]
*  And now I don't want Mitchell anywhere [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1815.08s)]
*  near the Brunson thing. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1817.12s)]
*  Even though I kind of default to like, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1819.0s)]
*  hey, have more talent, have two on-ball creators. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1821.52s)]
*  Like, that's what you want. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1824.36s)]
*  But I think Mitchell is a tough one [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  because I think it would take so much away from Brunson [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1829.72s)]
*  even if you'd love to see Brunson [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1831.72s)]
*  have another on-ball creator. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1833.48s)]
*  Like, that's what was so remarkable about this run [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1835.44s)]
*  is like, DiVincenzo can do some things. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1837.44s)]
*  It's not like you're running the offense through him [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1839.88s)]
*  at any point. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1841.52s)]
*  Heart's all complimentary. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1842.3600000000001s)]
*  OG had some incredible moments where even he surprised me, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1843.88s)]
*  but I think the overall package with him is that [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1847.88s)]
*  you're not going to just let him freestyle [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1850.4s)]
*  for multiple possessions an entire game offensively. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1852.48s)]
*  So it's- [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1855.72s)]
*  What's that contract for you, by the way? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1857.0s)]
*  For OG, I'm sure that's probably, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1859.28s)]
*  it's going to be a huge, scary number. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  And with his injury history alone. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1864.64s)]
*  I guess I'm always surprised when people are a little [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1866.72s)]
*  taken back when I talk about some of the OG limitations [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1869.4s)]
*  on offense. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1872.28s)]
*  Where I'm like, well, do not. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1874.4s)]
*  Like, you don't see it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1877.16s)]
*  I think we did this a week ago talking about, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1879.52s)]
*  I think he'd missed 120 games in the last four years. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1881.68s)]
*  They dialed up his minutes in the playoffs [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1884.04s)]
*  and he made it three weeks and got hurt. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1885.92s)]
*  You know, some guys just get hurt more than other guys. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1889.32s)]
*  Well, that's been his deal going back to college. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1892.04s)]
*  I mean, this is always been. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1895.0s)]
*  I always have that joke about LeBron. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1897.0s)]
*  Like if he landed the wrong way [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1898.52s)]
*  and his leg came off his body, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1899.8s)]
*  he would just go over and grab it and put it back on [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1901.24s)]
*  and then be back in the game. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1903.8s)]
*  Some guys are just wired differently. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1905.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1907.44s)]
*  I look forward to it every time. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1908.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1909.52s)]
*  I think it's the fourth time I've made it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1910.36s)]
*  Brunson ends, even though he had a bad game today, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1912.1599999999999s)]
*  he still ends 13 playoff games, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1914.84s)]
*  over 33 points a game for the playoffs. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1917.3999999999999s)]
*  And it still, you know, it just sucks [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  that it had to end this way. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1923.48s)]
*  But unfortunately, sometimes that's sports. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tLQunl4JCg&t=1924.4399999999998s)]
