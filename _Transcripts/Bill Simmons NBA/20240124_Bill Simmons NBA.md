# What do the Sixers Need to be Scary in the East? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3b9_h_DNlY)
*  And beads been incredible.
*  I mean, he's the game last night was on like, I was just, it really felt like he
*  could get 80 he's making 20 footers and 25 footers and he's spinning around.
*  He's just getting fouled.
*  He makes every free throw he takes.
*  He is the most unfalable big man we've had because it's just like, he's just
*  going to get two points immediately.
*  And the other end of was San Antonio, but he has looked awesome.
*  What KSC, what does that team need?
*  If you're, if you're the GM or you're the advisor and it seems like they have
*  spots basically for two trades, they could have done like a Roger type trade.
*  They could still get an Alex Caruso type of person.
*  Um, they could get somebody in the, they could get like a Bogdanovich from Detroit.
*  Maybe they could go all in on a Dejante Murray.
*  Um, I'm figuring let's say you give them a starter and a bench player in the
*  trade market, who are the ideal two people you would look at?
*  I'd want to be looking for an upgrade over Tobias Harris and Anthony Melton.
*  Those guys have been solid this year for the Sixers to be clear.
*  They've been rock solid, but if you're looking for that third creation option,
*  you have the Embiid Maxi two man game, but who is going to be the, the Michael
*  Porter Jr or the Aaron Gordon to the Yokech Murray two man, right?
*  Who's that guy Gordon for the nuggets we saw, he was beaten up on mismatches
*  on post-ups, Michael Porter Jr can go off.
*  Who's that guy for the Sixers?
*  So I think like the number one guy that like besides Terry Rozier, who did
*  make a heck of a lot of sense, um, Zach Levine being the other big name player
*  that people talk about all the time.
*  KSC is like his last defender.
*  But no, he's not.
*  I mean, I would not trade for Levine.
*  You're on Zach Levine Island.
*  Now admit it.
*  You have like, you have a property there.
*  You have like a small beach house on Levine Island.
*  No, I'm intrigued by what he was doing.
*  Playing with a player of the level of Embiid, but would he be the guy that I go for?
*  Not necessarily.
*  I'd rather wait and hold on to cap space this summer and figure things out then.
*  Um, but if I, if I'm the Sixers, I want a guy like a Caruso, just somebody who
*  can fit into that system or Demar de Rosen even like rather than Levine
*  expiring contract, add a little bit of a mid range, uh, and he's been shooting
*  more threes than ever before.
*  I'd be going for DeRosa and Caruso that combination, cause that gives you the
*  defense, it gives you the creation, it gives you the hustle with Caruso.
*  It gives you the experience with DeRosa.
*  And it's like, you're thinking like that's Tobias Harris, Marcus Morris's
*  contract and some picks and a swap.
*  And you get both of those guys, something along those lines where like you, you
*  get that because there's no overlap, but between Demar de Rosen and Tyrese Maxx.
*  They're different.
*  They're different.
*  But between Demar de Rosen and Tyrese Maxx, there are different types of
*  scores with the way they generate.
*  So crunch time you're going Embiid, Batum, DeRosa, Caruso and Maxx.
*  That sounds pretty good, right?
*  What do you think, Cas?
*  Yeah, it does sound pretty good.
*  I was kind of surprised in the context of the Hornets, you know, in this
*  kind of tear down mode and I'm going to lose so much money on my Hornets over
*  30 wins bet.
*  Well, that was the, we said that during the over under pod.
*  That was the stupidest fucking, we told you.
*  That one wasn't the dumbest.
*  The dumbest was the wizards.
*  But, uh, the Hornets have talent.
*  The Hornets have talent.
*  They just can't all be healthy on the same floor.
*  But the name that I show up, I saw show up today and in a potential combo deal
*  with the sons, which I still don't understand how could the sons have anything
*  left to give anybody is Miles Bridges.
*  Now, obviously that's a complicated person, a complicated figure, but
*  Miles Bridges on the Sixers, that to me is super intriguing.
*  Like I, that's a guy that can get tough buckets and what that team needs to
*  me end of game, five minutes left, four minutes left.
*  It's why DeRozan is a great call in terms of a fit.
*  He can get buckets.
*  He's a, he doesn't need the ball, uh, all the time.
*  I think Bridges would be incredible on this team.
*  My number one pick is DeRozan.
*  I was just watching him.
*  And they play last night.
*  Yeah.
*  Guess, guess who can still get really good shots in the last
*  five minutes of a game DeRozan.
*  Also two point shots, which, you know, honestly is the biggest
*  flaw of the Celtics right now.
*  We saw it on a Friday night in that Denver game.
*  Just Denver's ability to just get good shots in the last five minutes of a game,
*  which is their biggest skill.
*  That's their superpower.
*  Just every shot I like.
*  And Boston for 43, 44 minutes, I love all the shots I get last four minutes.
*  Everything slows down.
*  KP is over on the side now, like he was in Dallas.
*  He's not involved at all.
*  The guards aren't involved and it's Tatum and Brown and it's one-on-one stuff.
*  And it's just not smart basketball.
*  And that's why I think they have nine losses, KOC and eight.
*  They were tied in the last two minutes, but I really worry about their ability to
*  execute.
*  If the Sixers got DeRozan, now you're protected because I think you can
*  shut down two scores and beat a max.
*  I know in beads having a gray year.
*  I know max is really good, but if I'm only worrying about two guys, I'm fine.
*  But now if I have the third guy that can take the pressure off, who can go for 35
*  in a game three, where it's like, Oh, we didn't even need to beat a max tonight.
*  DeRozan went nuts.
*  I just think he would fit in with what they do.
*  And I, the only thing I would say about getting rid of Tobias, who I think has
*  been in trade rumors now for 10 years.
*  Awesome teammate knows his role.
*  Doesn't really care if he gets shots, like he's 17 a game.
*  He could probably do a little bit better than that.
*  And I'd be really hesitant.
*  This team seems like it really likes each other.
*  The contrast, I know you talked about on the mismatch last night, KFC, but the
*  contrast between Embiid chasing 70 versus Chatt, towns chasing 70 and what was
*  going on with that Minnesota team was night and day.
*  That whole Philly team, they were going for it for Embiid.
*  They were all locked in.
*  They really wanted it.
*  And I don't know, man, when your chemistry is good, the Celtics are in the same spot.
*  They have awesome chemistry.
*  It's going to be really hard for them to make a deal.
*  You know, it's going to have to be cosmetic, but I think DeRozan made,
*  I think we're all aligned.
*  Levine is the home run swing, but I think that the downside is too risky for
*  what his contract is, right?
*  What's his contract, KFC?
*  He currently is being paid $40 million and he is 40.
*  This is the first of four years remaining.
*  So he's going to be making near 50 by the end of that.
*  And for what it's worth, Bill, I just pulled up the trade machine.
*  They don't need to give up Tobias Harris in that deal.
*  Like, let's say they were to get DeRozan and Caruso, they'd be taking in $38 million.
*  They could get to 36 million with Morris.
*  So you could do Comington and Morris and, oh, interesting.
*  So you could get to the Paris and you could keep Harris in that situation.
*  Oh my God.
*  So that's my nightmare as a Celtic fan at that trade right there.
*  What are they giving the Bulls?
*  What do the Bulls get for that?
*  Just a lot of picks and some swaps and expirings.
*  Oh, they're going to do the Wizards plan.
*  They're going to become the Wizards.
*  Okay.
*  I guess my question with the Bulls, I know this is crazy, but I'm not
*  positive I would do anything unless it was an awesome trade.
*  I kind of like the Bulls.
*  Like they're nine right now.
*  They're 21 and 24.
*  I get it.
*  But they sucked in the beginning of the year.
*  I think they have a chance potentially to climb to seven or eight.
*  And I wouldn't want to see them in a one game, whatever.
*  I actually think they're pretty good.
*  Like in my house, you're making a face.
*  You watch the Bulls, like they're pretty good.
*  They're the same as last year.
*  They were three minutes away from knocking the key out of the playoffs.
*  I know.
*  Kobe White's totally different than he was last year.
*  I don't think they're the same.
*  I think they're largely the same.
