# Bill and Ryen’s NBA MVP Ballots | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE)
*  All right. It's awards time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=0.0s)]
*  Rosillo has ballot. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=2.4s)]
*  I have a ballot. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=3.6s)]
*  I talked to Zach low over the weekend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=6.08s)]
*  He gave up his ballot this year already has regrets. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  He's ready to get back in. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=11.6s)]
*  He's ready to have a taste. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=12.8s)]
*  We'll do MVP ballot first. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=15.68s)]
*  I think these are our official ballots. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=19.12s)]
*  We're just going to announce them here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=21.12s)]
*  We have to send them into the league in a couple of days. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=22.64s)]
*  Can I allow myself just a little wiggle room far more in pen than last week? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=26.0s)]
*  But since we know we're not getting the... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=31.2s)]
*  This is probably what it's going to be. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=35.44s)]
*  It's probably what it's going to be, but I need to look at over a second time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=37.76s)]
*  Is my point. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=42.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=43.28s)]
*  So I worked on it last night. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=43.36s)]
*  Yeah. I worked on it all last night. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=44.64s)]
*  I worked on it again this morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=45.92s)]
*  I even emailed the NBA. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=47.2s)]
*  I was like, Hey, I don't have the ballot. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=48.32s)]
*  They're like, actually not going to be getting it until later on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=49.2s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I just want to make sure I didn't get it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=51.6s)]
*  And then once I had that, I was like, I'm ready to do this, but I've just, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=53.28s)]
*  we know how it works. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=56.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=57.44s)]
*  There's a chance I could possibly change something, but these, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=57.84s)]
*  this is pretty close to what I'm going to do. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=60.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  That's my... [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=62.8s)]
*  So you, so you're using a really nice pencil, but not a Sharpie. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=63.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=68.4s)]
*  It's a pen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=68.72s)]
*  If I'm going to go technical about it, but I have other pages. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=69.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=71.92s)]
*  As you know, I'll do my, my annual preamble. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=75.28s)]
*  I love the awards. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=79.36s)]
*  I think they're really important. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=80.88s)]
*  It's an important snapshot of the season. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=82.4s)]
*  It's fun to look back on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  It's fun too, when you're comparing these guys historically someday, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  and you talk about, oh, NBA teams and where they placed them, the MVP ballot, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=89.12s)]
*  stuff like that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  It matters. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  We take it very seriously. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=94.56s)]
*  The MVP ballot, I have Jokic first. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=97.28s)]
*  SGA climbed a second for me because they got the one seed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  I had him third heading into the weekend behind Luca. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  And then Oklahoma city getting the one seed with the year that SGA had. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=108.4s)]
*  I'm second. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=111.84s)]
*  I have Luca third. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=112.4s)]
*  I did it, man. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=114.56s)]
*  I put Jalen Brunson fourth and I put Janice fifth. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=115.28s)]
*  So Jokic, SGA, Luca Brunson, Janice is going to be my ballot. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=119.28s)]
*  What did you have? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=124.48s)]
*  I had Jokic. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=126.56s)]
*  Number two, I have Luca. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=130.08s)]
*  Number three, I have Janice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=133.6s)]
*  I think his individual season to do what he did. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=136.72s)]
*  Is something that needs to be ahead of some of the other guys. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=139.6s)]
*  I struggled a lot with the last two spots, but I went SGA and there's plenty of statistical [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=143.76s)]
*  numbers that would tell you Ford might even be low for him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=149.76s)]
*  And then based on the way I did my first team, all NBA and then the MVP thing and how I did it, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=153.84s)]
*  I ended up putting Brunson down fifth and then I'll explain what I did on all first team NBA. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=159.92s)]
*  Later on. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to have Brunson second team on NBA and fourth MVP because I think they're two [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=165.44s)]
*  slightly different honors. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=170.16s)]
*  We didn't talk about this ahead of time, but that's exactly what I did too. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=172.8s)]
*  Cause I was like, I'm putting, I'm not removing Tatum from first team, all NBA. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=175.52s)]
*  And I'm going to acknowledge what it is that Brunson has done in the valuable sense of it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=181.68s)]
*  So that's funny. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=186.4s)]
*  We didn't, you know, we didn't talk about that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=187.2s)]
*  We didn't talk about that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=189.12s)]
*  We didn't talk about that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=189.92s)]
*  We didn't talk about that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=190.8s)]
*  I thought about having him third because to get to 50 wins, as we discussed in part one with [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  Randall missing 60% of the season and Mitchell Robinson now, and a couple of new teammates. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  And I just thought it was really impressive what he means to the franchise and the team, how [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  because he's there that D'Fernandes ends up coming there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=207.68s)]
*  I think stuff like that matters when you have like a real guy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=210.72s)]
*  And I think that's what's important. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=213.84s)]
*  And I think that's what's important. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=215.12s)]
*  And I think that's what's important. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=216.16s)]
*  And I think that's what's important. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=217.12s)]
*  I think stuff like that matters when you have like a real guy, when you think like people are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=218.72s)]
*  arguing about, Oh my God, did they overpay for Brunson? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=222.72s)]
*  And I remember you and I telling people like that deals fucking awesome, man. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=226.48s)]
*  You're not going to regret Brunson. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=230.32s)]
*  I never thought he'd be this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=231.92s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=233.04s)]
*  No, neither of us did, but we knew that was a good deal. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=234.32s)]
*  You know, you're getting a guy who proved that he could play in a playoff series and have, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=238.32s)]
*  and be impactful. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=242.4s)]
*  We never knew he was going to be a 29 point a game guy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=243.44s)]
*  I had him ahead of Giannis just because. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=248.24s)]
*  I mean, first of all, they finished with a higher seed than the bucks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=252.0s)]
*  I think that the winning piece of it matters a little bit, but the whole buck season was [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=254.64s)]
*  so strange with the two coaches and it was so choppy with, with Giannis and Dame sometimes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=258.24s)]
*  offensively. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=264.4s)]
*  And, you know, they spent a lot of money on that roster, whether it was the right roster [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=265.2s)]
*  and it's the right group of guys. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=270.96s)]
*  Like, you know, they went all in, they traded all their picks for holiday and then for Dame. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=272.24s)]
*  They spent a lot of money on the, on the side pieces on the roster. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  I just felt like he was in a good situation and the team under achieved. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  So I couldn't put him higher than, than five. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=288.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=291.12s)]
*  Well, the reason they finished in the three seed behind New York is because he wasn't [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=291.36s)]
*  playing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=294.16s)]
*  He was the first player to ever score 30 a game and finished at 60% or better from the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=294.48s)]
*  floor. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=298.16s)]
*  First guy to ever do it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=298.48s)]
*  And when I add in the defensive stuff that I think he does where, you know, over the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=300.72s)]
*  years we've looked at this Milwaukee defense and I go, you know, the real thing is just [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=307.12s)]
*  Giannis being able to screw everything up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  And yet he never gets all defense mentions ever. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=315.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=318.16s)]
*  So he played 73 games this year and I do probably look at, like all of us look at it differently [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=318.56s)]
*  that have our votes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  You don't want somebody like being a complete wild card with it, but the seating can matter [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=326.64s)]
*  for me and then it can kind of not matter. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's where I'd get some pushback on having SGA fourth. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=334.0s)]
*  It's like, Hey, well, they were the one seed and you go, well, you know, Boston, if there [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=337.36s)]
*  was a Boston MVP candidate that was tied with somebody else, I would go, okay, well look, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  they finished that many games ahead of everybody else. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=345.44s)]
*  I'm going to recognize that and put that in there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  I just feel like Giannis is at worst the third best player in the league. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=350.48s)]
*  And he just had one of the great historical seasons. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=353.92s)]
*  He plays a ton of defense. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  He plays hard every single night. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=357.68s)]
*  He played basically a full season and it came down to the last day in a game. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=359.36s)]
*  Where he wasn't playing for the last few. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=363.68s)]
*  So even though they were sort of a mess, they still only finished one game behind Milwaukee. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  So it wasn't like I was going to put Brunson ahead of him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=370.96s)]
*  I mean, look, I had Giannis too, most of the year until Luca just put together this stretch [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=372.8s)]
*  in Dallas, you know, collectively was far better than, than what we saw in Milwaukee. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=378.48s)]
*  We should say being five this season, there's no shame in that compared to some of the other [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=383.44s)]
*  seasons we've had in the past. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  10 years ago, there were guys getting the four spot in the five spot in MVP where you're like, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=390.64s)]
*  like, maybe I'll put this guy here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=396.0s)]
*  In this case, like Tatum not being on it when the Celtics goes 64 and 18, like [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=398.4s)]
*  that tells you how deep and how awesome I think a lot of the players were this year. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=403.84s)]
*  I did the same thing though. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=408.8s)]
*  Tatum was always fourth or fifth, probably more fifth, which is not really a knock on him. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=410.0s)]
*  It's more about the team. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=416.16s)]
*  It's hard for Tatum because you can't be like, oh, well, he's that great. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  Yet we sit here and look at the starting five and go, this is statistically been one of the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=420.64s)]
*  best starting fives in the history of the league. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=424.4s)]
*  So I look at it as a recognition of Brunson and like an incredible accomplishment where, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=426.08s)]
*  you know, Knicks fans are going to go, well, you know, he should have been, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=432.88s)]
*  there's just no world. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=436.24s)]
*  I was ever going to vote him ahead of a couple of these other guys. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=437.12s)]
*  And just as great as this run has been, I don't think he's, he's those, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=439.2s)]
*  you know, the 500 guys that play. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=445.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=447.84s)]
*  He's, I have them higher than 495 of them, but I'm not going to put them ahead of guys like [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=449.2s)]
*  Luca or, or Jokic. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=455.76s)]
*  It's a good argument. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=457.36s)]
*  I don't know if there's a right answer. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=458.4s)]
*  I feel good about Brunson and four. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=459.92s)]
*  Shay at two, I'll just make the case really quick. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=462.56s)]
*  So the one seed to me does matter with that because we watched so many games this year [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=467.76s)]
*  where I couldn't believe they won the game and they basically won the game because of the shit [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  he did down the stretch, where I felt like if you put other players in that spot on that, okay, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=477.12s)]
*  see team, his two way play, the burden that he had offensively, the way he was always getting [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=482.16s)]
*  to his spots, no matter who they're playing against and the consistency of just like, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=488.64s)]
*  we talked about this last month with him about just how many good games that dude has, you know, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=493.44s)]
*  I think what was the stat? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=499.36s)]
*  Like he had like 52 30 point games, something like that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=500.32s)]
*  The consistency, his ability to get to the line over and over again, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  they're plus 10.8 net when he plays, he played 25, 37 minutes, 2,537 minutes. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  Him with Jalen Williams together, they're over 12 net rating. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=515.44s)]
*  He led the league in steals 2.1. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=518.64s)]
*  And I just thought he had like a kind of unnatural burden [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=522.32s)]
*  because Milwaukee, like they would have nights where it's like, all right, it's a Dame night. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=526.32s)]
*  You know, all right, Janice just had, all he has to do is run around and, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=530.0s)]
*  you know, get some rebounds and get some lobs. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=533.6s)]
*  And this is kind of, this is going to be the night Dame has 45. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=535.6s)]
*  There was never a night like that for SGA. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=539.36s)]
*  SGA was like, we don't really have a center. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=541.6s)]
*  I'm relying on dudes who are 22, 23, 24 years old. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  We're going to other people's houses and winning. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  I was just so impressed. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=550.48s)]
*  I thought about him a tiny bit for actual MVP. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=551.6s)]
*  And then I, and then I, then I took a glass of water. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what am I doing? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=559.7600000000001s)]
*  Yoke is the best part in 10 years. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=560.6400000000001s)]
*  But now I was just like, all right, this guy got the one seed. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=562.24s)]
*  Denver got the two seed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  Let me think this out in my head. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  And then I was like, all right, Yoke is just obviously the MVP, but it did. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=567.5200000000001s)]
*  He made me pause for two seconds, which was inconceivable a month ago. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=571.36s)]
*  I always find that interesting that you would feel a certain way about MVP. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=577.5200000000001s)]
*  And then the seeding can change in the last 12 hours. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=582.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, but part of it to me is like, who had a harder job? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=585.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=589.2s)]
*  In Yoke edge, the reason this is where I landed with the Oak edge, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=589.92s)]
*  like the reason he didn't get the MVP was because Murray didn't play enough games. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=593.28s)]
*  I think Murray ended up with 58. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=596.48s)]
*  They had to rest Murray down the stretch for what was the, he sat out like eight games. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=598.16s)]
*  And I just don't think when Murray doesn't play, I just don't think that team's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=602.32s)]
*  that special around Yoke edge, you know? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=606.0s)]
*  But, uh, but it was at least a conversation, but Yoke is the MVP is the best player in the league. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=608.16s)]
*  For the metric stuff, which was always funny about the Yoke edge and bead arguments, because [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=615.04s)]
*  in bead people will be like, Oh, you guys are just using these stupid numbers. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=621.28s)]
*  You'd be like, Oh, you mean the ones were in beads, like off the charts and all of them? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=624.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=627.52s)]
*  Like some of these numbers tell you like, Oh, hey, if Yoke edge has the most wind shares in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=627.76s)]
*  the league this year, like, okay, that's pretty good. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=633.68s)]
*  But then the wind share stuff PR was probably more susceptible to falling victim of like really [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=636.16s)]
*  overvaluing big guys that rebounded a lot. Maybe didn't shoot that much. They had a higher field [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=641.92s)]
*  goal percentage because they were really stretching it out. The fact that SGA, like this is an [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=646.56s)]
*  argument for your side of the SGA thing of having him too, like he's only behind Yoke [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=650.16s)]
*  edge and some of that stuff. And for a recruiter guy, you know, a lot of it's the, well, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't need to mention the free throw part of it. He's just that good at adding the free throw part [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=661.12s)]
*  to the rest of the game. So you know, my favorite SGA status by the way, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=665.28s)]
*  Do you think he'll finish second in the overall voting? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I think it's going to be between him and Luca for second. And I honestly don't know. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=673.76s)]
*  I think it's going to be close. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  Do you think he's better than Luca? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=679.44s)]
*  No. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=681.6s)]
*  Okay. I'm not doing this because I think you're wrong. I'm just, I'm, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  I think he had a better regular season than Luca did because his job was harder and he needed, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=688.24s)]
*  there needed to be a consistency. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  Wait, you think Dallas, you think, geez, I don't know about that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=696.96s)]
*  Okay. See, he's a better roster than Dallas. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  But Luca had the Kyrie piece though. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=704.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But what about our guy Jay William? Two or one, not two. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=708.08s)]
*  I love Jaylen Williams and thought about him as like a fringe. Can I talk myself into him? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  Third team OMB, but at the end of these okay. See games, it was kind of SGA or bust. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=717.2s)]
*  There was a couple of times where Jaylen Williams was doing the Kauai thing that we talked about [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  last week or two weeks ago, where you'd start going by people. But for the most part, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=726.4s)]
*  you knew where okay. See, he was going every time. I don't know. I was impressed. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  The best SGA staff for me on two point field goals, he shot 58%. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=735.36s)]
*  Which for a guard is nuts. That's just not, you know, but it speaks to like when you watch him [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=742.8s)]
*  and just how he'd get to his spots and you get his points or he'd get fouled. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=748.8s)]
*  I thought Luca was awesome. Luca was 34, nine and 10. He made 284 threes. His usage was lower, 36. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=752.96s)]
*  He played the most minutes he's ever played, 26, 24. So, and Dallas got better as the year [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=764.72s)]
*  went along, which I think matters more than anything, but you know, okay. So he had a better [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=771.36s)]
*  season. So you mentioned Jokic. He led the league in PR, wind shares, wind share 48 and warp. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=775.76s)]
*  He played the most minutes he's ever played this year over 2700. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  He crushed it in warp, by the way. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=787.84s)]
*  Huge warp this year for that guy. Plus 11.6 net 27, 12 and nine every night. Not to mention some [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=790.56s)]
*  of the greatest like team chemistry stuff. And you know, Murray was, I wouldn't say like [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=798.72s)]
*  Lou Gehrig this season. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=806.4s)]
*  There's another thing I was looking at with Jokic's numbers before the all-star break, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=810.64s)]
*  33.8 minutes per game. Then they cranked it up to about 37. It took one more shot. Now that's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=814.48s)]
*  always been the thing with him at certain times. Like one of the years we won the scoring or excuse [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=821.2s)]
*  me, when he won the MVP or like, do you know how low he is in shot attempts in comparison to these [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=825.44s)]
*  other guys? And this guy's won MVP. This is all the hours of watching it. And I couldn't imagine [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=829.6s)]
*  coming up with a different conclusion than Jokic. Just the number of times where he controlled [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  everything. And as I say that, it's like, oh wait, Donchich doesn't do that as well. You know, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=843.6s)]
*  and you're just like, okay, you're right. But there's just this puppet master element of Jokic [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=846.96s)]
*  that's happening every second he's out on the floor. And I couldn't, you know, I just didn't [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  struggle with it as much this year because it wasn't the Embiid showdown. Now if Embiid had [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=863.52s)]
*  finished the year with the highest ever PER, like imagine the wrench. And scoring 35 a game and 70 [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=867.68s)]
*  games and yeah, I'm with him. The other part with Jokic, which we talk about every year is something [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=873.04s)]
*  about how he plays transfers to some of the other guys in the team. And they're a little more [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=880.48s)]
*  unselfish and a little more thoughtful about passes and extra looks than I think they would be if [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=886.32s)]
*  they're on like Charlotte. So I just wanted to mention that. You think it'd be different on [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  Charlotte? Yeah, I think it'd be a little different. You don't like Michael Porter Jr. on Charlotte? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=895.44s)]
*  Not as much. I don't know. Fred G Jackson is impactful off the bench. Just out of curiosity, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=900.32s)]
*  because Shea versus Luca, I think is, I think it was closer than it seems like you think. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=907.28s)]
*  I also don't think Shea is the player he's ultimately going to be. Like I don't think this [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=914.88s)]
*  was his career apex. He's never going to be better than this. If he starts shooting threes, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=918.72s)]
*  like let's say he becomes a 40% three point shooter and starts making like, I don't know, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  two and a half, three threes a game on top of everything else he's doing. I do think there's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=931.76s)]
*  a world where he swims in that pool with Luca and those guys and he might already be there. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=935.44s)]
*  He's going to have to do in the playoffs, which we haven't seen yet. And that's the last piece of [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  this. And that's why we're always careful with regular season versus playoffs. I want to see him [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=944.72s)]
*  do this in a playoff series with a team that's playing against him for two straight weeks. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  That's planning for him, thinking about ways to fuck with him. We've never seen it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  But I do think if he adds a three point shot, his stats might not be that far away from Luca's. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=959.0400000000001s)]
*  But whenever there's a scoring peak for a player, it usually comes down to like, all right, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=965.44s)]
*  what else is around him? So I would agree that if SGA cranks it up to 37, 38% from three and starts [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  taking five or six of those games, as opposed to I think just over three now. Yeah. Like maybe you [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=980.32s)]
*  could just keep adding it. But what I would see on the horizon for the Thunder is that he may score [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=986.4000000000001s)]
*  less because the team continues to get better. Yeah. You're right. And all the assets of what [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=992.0s)]
*  that ends up turning into, because there's probably one other big piece coming. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=997.36s)]
*  So your toughest MVP ballot admission was who? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=1001.52s)]
*  Probably Tatum. Because I felt like, Hey, I know I'm going to have Tatum in the five. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=1006.96s)]
*  Yeah. I can't believe it, but that's where I split the difference on the all first team NBA. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=1011.76s)]
*  That's so funny. We did the same thing because I felt like, Hey, that's kind of the way I feel [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=1018.32s)]
*  like I'm acknowledging both. Yeah. Tatum for me too. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxb4uOvMjE&t=1021.76s)]
