# Do the Bucks Have Real Issues? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqOQK6xWihQ)
*  You wanna hear from the body language doctor?
*  Oh, the bugs, the body language is, it's, it's, it's.
*  By the way, confirmed because after the game,
*  Chris Haynes wrote a piece of Bleacher Report
*  about how Bobby Pordis challenged Adrian Griffin
*  in a polite way, but challenged him in the locker room
*  because Griffin was talking about
*  we gotta do the rebounding weather,
*  and Pordis was like, we gotta execute better, you know?
*  This is, and it was enough to have
*  a splashy Bleacher Report story,
*  but the body language doctor did not like
*  what he saw from the bugs today.
*  Now, maybe, you know, caught him on the wrong night,
*  it's possible, but the Yanis thing is just weird.
*  It's just weird.
*  Every time there's a timeout, he sits on the scorers table
*  for like, what, 40 seconds-wise?
*  Dude, he would, so he, as the timeout started,
*  he would stay at the scorers table and sit down.
*  So he doesn't sit with his teammates.
*  Doesn't sit with his teammates.
*  Little timeout.
*  He's still in the game.
*  His brother, The Gnosis, might come over and angle over
*  and be like, yo, there's this thing and this and that,
*  and then with the five seconds left to break the huddle,
*  Yanis ambles on over.
*  One, two reasons why that's weird, Rob.
*  One, all the reporting suggests that this Adrian Griffin
*  thing was a Yanis pacification.
*  That's a one.
*  So this was your guy, and it seems like you're out on him.
*  And two, the last time we saw a guy doing this was KD
*  his last year with the Golden State Warriors.
*  Oh, that's a great point.
*  Yeah, he would come back in for like the-
*  That's the last time I saw this!
*  He'd come in for the last 20 seconds of the huddle
*  and then walk back, but he was non-connected with teammates.
*  KD would hang out by the rim, though.
*  He would just go near the rim, sort of hang on the net,
*  do the thing. That's a great analogy.
*  But, you know, luckily for the Bucks-
*  But Yanis was never like this.
*  He never did stuff like this.
*  He was always like in the middle of stuff.
*  And there was another moment, Yanis was,
*  they were shooting free throws, Indiana,
*  and Yanis was at the low block about to re, you know,
*  we're waiting for the first free throw.
*  And Griffin took him out and the guy comes in,
*  I think they called him Poe.
*  Cause I've heard Brooke call him Yanni,
*  but then some other teammates call him Poe.
*  I like, I personally enjoy Yanni.
*  But that guy just has a nickname,
*  I think we should get it going.
*  But he's like, Poe, Poe.
*  And he's like, me? I'm coming out.
*  And he was pissed.
*  And he walked out and Griffin was at half court.
*  And every time a player walks by the coach,
*  they do the, you know, the slap five or whatever.
*  It was just fucking walk by him.
*  Just right by him.
*  Just going with silence.
*  And then he came back in like what, two minutes later?
*  But we were like, whoa,
*  cause we were sitting right there watching it.
*  We were like, oh, that's-
*  That's what I did when I didn't get the call
*  for the Sea of Love rewatchable.
*  I just coasted right on by you.
*  Yeah, but so we had that.
*  We had, you know, Dane's not exactly Mr. Charismatic
*  on any team.
*  That's just, he does his own thing.
*  I mean, I didn't feel like he was any different, but-
*  But in fairness to Dane, it's tough to come in there.
*  No, he's just Dane.
*  All these guys have already been there.
*  He's the same guy, yeah.
*  And to be like, all right guys,
*  we're taking orders from Dane now.
*  Like, that would be kind of tough.
*  It's a quiet team, except for Portis.
*  And Lopez to some degree, but there's like,
*  and then Middleton was the other thing
*  that I really wanted to see in person
*  before I made my official opinion on it.
*  But he just looks like he's, you know,
*  on the other side of the mountain a little bit.
*  He does, he's not the guy from the 2021 playoffs anymore.
*  He's older and I don't feel like he moves side to side
*  the same way I thought it was tougher for him
*  to beat guys off the dribble.
*  He's just a different version of Middleton.
*  So I think-
*  I think offensively, he's been pretty solid.
*  Defensively, I'm concerned.
*  But he did pretty solid,
*  wasn't gonna win the 2021 finals.
*  Like that guy was huge for them.
*  He's just not the same guy.
*  Defensively, you're right though.
*  Yeah, and that's where you hope that by playoff time,
*  Chris is looking a little bit more spry,
*  a little bit more agile.
*  He has put up points and when he's been on the floor,
*  by and large, the Bucs have been very,
*  very good this season.
*  I think the concern, and if I were Yanis,
*  if I'm putting myself in his head
*  as assistant to the body language doctor,
*  I'm not sure what my jurisdiction is here exactly.
*  You're the physician's assistant.
*  Yeah.
*  Rob Mahoney's gonna come in now and see you
*  and take your blood.
*  We gotta pay the bills somehow.
*  If I'm putting myself in Yanis' head,
*  I'm not worried about Chris or Dame so much,
*  or even Brooke.
*  I'm looking at everybody else.
*  And I'm looking at, in this game,
*  we can look at these tournament games
*  as a statement for someone like Tyrese Halliburton.
*  Tyrese Halliburton has announced his presence
*  to a wider swath of audience,
*  and he's stepped up in every situation
*  you can step up as a star in these games.
*  But it's also about which role players
*  are ready to compete like this.
*  And on Indiana's side,
*  you've got TJ McConnell making big plays.
*  You've got Andrew Nemhard coming in
*  and making big plays against the Zones.
*  Yeah, swinging quarters.
*  Isaiah Jackson having big stretches in this game.
*  And if you're Yanis,
*  you're looking at Marjon Beauchamp
*  and AJ Green and Andre Jackson,
*  who can barely get in the game,
*  against a Pacers team that went 10 deep and beat you.
*  I think that is where the win
*  gets out of your sails a little bit.
*  Yeah, that's a good point.
*  Well, that's what happens when you trade assets
*  over and over again for supporting characters.
*  At some point, you run out of assets
*  and you got Beauchamp,
*  and they gave Andre Jackson a look.
*  Who is that? Our guy, AJ Green, came in.
*  You got a couple minutes.
*  I'm a fan of AJ Green.
*  I think he needs to get more of a sniff.
*  We were like, what's going on here?
*  Yeah, he did some sniffing.
*  Get some more looks in.
*  Obviously, Pat Connaughton didn't play today.
*  No, he didn't.
*  Not having Pat Connaughton that much,
*  that's kind of part of the problem.
*  But here's what I'll say.
*  My man, Eric Niem, my former colleague at The Athletic,
*  put out a piece today,
*  and it was talking about how come the Dame and Giannis
*  pick and roll partnership has not come out
*  like gangbusters yet.
*  And essentially, the piece makes the point that one,
*  Giannis isn't used to doing this yet,
*  which I think he'll be better at.
*  Two, the spacing has been weird.
*  And somebody's supposed to be coaching that up, y'all.
*  And somebody fired Terry Stott,
*  one of the most respected offensive minds
*  in the whole league two days before the season.
*  And so, Bobby Portis is calling you out in the locker room.
*  Look, these contracts is guaranteed now.
*  I don't want to call for people's jobs,
*  come on now.
*  The writing's on the wall, folks.
*  It's a little rocky.
*  Well, there's that other stretch.
*  Remember when Giannis was super mad
*  because he didn't get the ball for like four minutes?
*  And I mean, every time they gave Giannis the ball,
*  he just went to the rim,
*  neither scored or dunked or missed the layup,
*  but was just getting great shots over and over again.
*  I think you're right, Rob,
*  about the yin and yang of the Dame and Giannis
*  and just him trying to learn to play with somebody
*  who has a usage rate like that.
*  And in the old days, it was always like,
*  all right, Giannis, come bail us out, come bail us out.
*  And now they also have to get this Dame thing going.
*  Dame had a weird game because he was really bad.
*  And then all of a sudden got super hot for seven minutes
*  and then kind of reverted back
*  and they're going after him on defense.
*  But I didn't like what I saw.
*  I'm not gonna put my stamp down
*  and say the Bucs are screwed, this is it.
*  But no, no.
*  We've still got 60 games.
*  Talk about a two month checkpoint, it's not awesome.
*  They're missing some dudes and the vibe didn't seem great.
*  The vibe might not have seemed great,
*  but this was a sick game.
*  Yeah, it was awesome.
*  Giannis was unbelievable.
*  And here's the thing,
*  if we're gonna say the Pacers played great
*  and the Bucs were with them every step of the way,
*  basically, I think the Bucs,
*  this was not a good Bucs game,
*  but I thought Giannis played well.
*  I thought Dame, again, as you said,
*  Bill had a very weird night overall,
*  outscored by Miles Turner, Damian Lillard was,
*  which that's not a winning recipe for the Bucs
*  by any stretch.
*  But yeah, I'm not abandoning ship on Milwaukee yet.
*  There's way too much here to work with.
*  No, no, no, I'm not abandoning ship.
*  All of these criticisms are based on a team
*  that we think can win the championship, right?
*  They're not OKC where if they make the second round this year,
*  we're gonna throw them a parade and pat them on the ass.
*  Like, the expectation is championship or bust this year.
*  And so that's what the criticisms are based on.
*  Obviously, it's not time to abandon ship
*  and burn up all of your Bucs futures.
*  Like, we still got time here, guys.
*  60 games.
