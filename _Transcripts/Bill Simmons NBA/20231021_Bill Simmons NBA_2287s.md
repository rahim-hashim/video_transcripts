# Are the Celtics the Clear Title Favorites in the East? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To)
*  All right, guys, Boston Celtics, 54 and a half. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=0.0s)]
*  They're plus 165 for the one seat, plus 380 for the title, plus 175 for the conference. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=4.64s)]
*  They were 57 and 25 last year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=10.28s)]
*  This just instinctively feels like an over to me, but I don't trust myself because it's my favorite team. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=15.16s)]
*  But I do think like the holiday white thing is going to be awesome. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And there's a lot of ways to talk about this team. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=24.52s)]
*  What's the number one thing you're looking at, Rossella? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Their guys play. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=29.4s)]
*  I mean, other than Prezengiz, their guys play. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=30.32s)]
*  So that's why they feel like a safer over for one of the highest projected teams. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=32.68s)]
*  But you know where you can find. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=37.64s)]
*  So, you know, usually somebody wins a conference like mid to high fifties and considering- [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=38.6s)]
*  Like a 58, 59, 60 range. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=44.16s)]
*  I love the depth. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=46.68s)]
*  I love the versatility. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=47.56s)]
*  Prezengiz scares the shit out of me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=48.84s)]
*  But even without him, I think they win a lot of games. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  House, there was this moment, the first preseason game, they put Prezengiz in the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=53.2s)]
*  corner in the Al Horford spot and Tatum had the ball or somebody had, and they swung [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=58.36s)]
*  around and they threw it to him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=62.6s)]
*  He was open, but then somebody closed out on him, but he's seven foot three and he [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  just shot a wide open three over the guy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  And I was like, Oh, I just think this is a nice spot for Prezengiz. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  I have no idea if he can play healthy and they're going to post him up and they're [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=75.8s)]
*  going to use, he's going to have these incredible defensive guards. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=79.08s)]
*  All he's going to have to do is protect the rim. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=82.44s)]
*  I'm sure there's going to be a couple of teams that try to pound them and exploit them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  What did you see from him last year that makes you think he could be the missing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  piece for a Boston Celtics title? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  His versatility. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  He absolutely gets it going sometimes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=94.84s)]
*  And you can kind of tell right away if he's in his rhythm. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  And he surprisingly would go down and mix it up a little bit. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=104.12s)]
*  Now you defensively, he can't be under the basket. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=107.48s)]
*  If he's under the basket, it's a bucket. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=110.28s)]
*  He's a guaranteed bucket. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=112.28s)]
*  Who was the guy who caught him last year? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  Vucovic? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=115.04s)]
*  Absolutely annihilated him. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=115.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  That bulls game. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=118.28s)]
*  They just parked him down below there and let Vucovic put him in the torture [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  chamber and he did it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  The biggest question mark to me isn't the fit of Prezengiz because I think it will [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  work great. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=130.08s)]
*  Like, you know, he, I'll knock on wood for it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=130.96s)]
*  He should be like not in harm's way with the construction of this team and that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=135.4s)]
*  roster. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  The question to me with the Celtics and the only like hesitation reservation I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=140.12s)]
*  have, what's the, what's the defensive identity? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=143.52s)]
*  You lost the two stalwarts, the real plus Grant Williams. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=145.88s)]
*  I mean, I know Grant Williams and Joe Mas couldn't get on the same page. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=149.24s)]
*  They couldn't figure out, you know, the right role for Williams, but those are [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=151.68s)]
*  like tough guys, tough attitudes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=157.52s)]
*  They, they, you know, got out to the extended to the perimeter. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  They had the commitment to do that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=161.68s)]
*  What's the defensive identity of this team? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=163.56s)]
*  Well, Drew's a better defender than smart is. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=166.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=168.56s)]
*  And it's not even no argument, no argument. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  So in white is better than smart. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  I think too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=174.12s)]
*  Would you say those are the two best defensive perimeter guards in the league? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=174.96s)]
*  Caruso and Caruso. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=178.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=180.6s)]
*  I think Caruso might be better. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=180.8s)]
*  You could argue you might be better than both of them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=182.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=184.08s)]
*  But they're in the discussion. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=184.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, some people like look at white is just being too small and Miami was [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=187.32s)]
*  looking to attack him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  And it sometimes it looked like it was like, Oh wait, white's just overmatched [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=193.36s)]
*  at this level when it matters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=196.52s)]
*  But I think, you know, the most basic thing you're asking for from your [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=198.24s)]
*  perimeter guys is like, just don't screw it up by not knowing what we're doing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  And white is definitely smart with that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=205.52s)]
*  Like, look, the Rob Williams part of it, it's a luxury, but I'm telling you [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=207.4s)]
*  every time, every few weeks he would land and you'd go, Oh, he's hurt. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=211.32s)]
*  No, he's not hurt. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=215.8s)]
*  Wait, he's hurt. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=216.8s)]
*  He's playing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=217.88s)]
*  I can't tell if he's hurt or not. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=218.68s)]
*  Like it's, I just tell him Portland fans, like get used to it because it's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  constant and if you're a team that's trying to win a championship and you're [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=223.8s)]
*  banking on him being healthy all the time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  What would you compare him to for a purchase in Manhattan beach, like a golf [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=229.64s)]
*  cart that keeps breaking down. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=234.28s)]
*  It seems like an awesome idea to have a golf cart. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=236.44s)]
*  I think it is a lot like the golf cart, but not because it's breaking down. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=238.68s)]
*  It's like, well, Hey, I don't drive drunk, but it's a golf cart. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=241.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=248.32s)]
*  So you're like, I'm not really doing anything wrong. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=248.64s)]
*  It's just a golf cart. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=250.64s)]
*  How fast can I go? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=251.6s)]
*  It's the golf cart. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=252.48s)]
*  I think their defensive identity is the Drew, Derek White and Tatum, who [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=254.24s)]
*  I think is going to play really hard this year because I think he's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=259.68s)]
*  excited that this is his team. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  I think he is an MVP candidate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=263.88s)]
*  I'm not going to pick it, but I think this team is going to really [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=265.32000000000005s)]
*  give a shit in the regular season. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=268.72s)]
*  And I think there's going to be an attitude and identity with them because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=270.8s)]
*  they have a bunch of guys who play hard. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  After what happened last year, losing to Miami, there's no reason, like who are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=276.0s)]
*  they to think that they can just mail it in this year and then see what happens. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=281.12s)]
*  They should be furious about what happened. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=284.56s)]
*  That's a bunch of bench guys that I think are going to give a shit. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  Like Prichard, who they paid, but I think Prichard is, I don't think it's going to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=289.04s)]
*  happen, but you don't think Prichard is as the six man of the year conversation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=293.56s)]
*  with people in a circle. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=297.24s)]
*  Like I think I could do it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  25 minutes a game. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=299.72s)]
*  I'm going to be a top five three point shooter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=301.68s)]
*  Prichard is an irrational confidence guy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=304.16s)]
*  I like Brissette. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=307.36s)]
*  I think Jordan Walsh is going to be a fan favorite. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=309.6s)]
*  I think their bench is going to come in and swing some home games. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=312.8s)]
*  I don't trust it on the road as much, but the top six is great. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=315.44s)]
*  Horford should not play more than 1200 minutes max. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=318.96s)]
*  I would just keep him in the garage. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=322.36s)]
*  I can't believe what they got from last year. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=324.08s)]
*  And, but you could even see then him being so good all last year. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=326.8s)]
*  Like, I don't know if that's why he was at the end, but that was a big win. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=331.4s)]
*  He couldn't move in the playoffs or he couldn't move against Miami. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=335.76s)]
*  It couldn't make any shots. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=338.96s)]
*  If they're wrong about Joe Missoula, is that the biggest [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=341.24s)]
*  mistake anyone made this summer? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=345.12s)]
*  Because if they're wrong about him, they basically went all in and they blamed, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=348.76s)]
*  they said it was everybody else's fault. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  And if we just get this guy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=354.8s)]
*  Well, did they say that? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=356.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=358.96s)]
*  Does that mean they believe it? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=359.36s)]
*  You know, I think they, I just don't know how you can do that job the first year [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=360.68s)]
*  and not be making mistakes all the time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=366.08s)]
*  Especially with like barely any assistance. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=370.44s)]
*  That's the, that's the point. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=370.88s)]
*  How about Jeff Van Gundy in the mix? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=372.84s)]
*  Well, this is a hard guy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=374.32s)]
*  Look at what they did assistant coach wise. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=375.8s)]
*  This is what one of the bits of research I did was like, let's be honest. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=378.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=385.36s)]
*  Um, but I wanted to see how they built this up because as I'm genuinely curious [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  about forecasting this, the Celtics team, it was this Jeff, Jeff Van Gundy thing, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  which was funny senior advisor, but they brought in Sam Cassell. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=395.88s)]
*  And Charles Lee. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=399.12s)]
*  Charles Lee. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  Really good. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=400.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=401.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=401.6s)]
*  The first assistant under coach Bud on the 21 winning bucks team. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=402.04s)]
*  And then, uh, Emil Jefferson, Tatum's guy from Duke, uh, Phil Pressley. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=407.0s)]
*  Like that's, that's, that's, you know, doing it right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't their fault, but he may had the issue that he had. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=415.96s)]
*  And they get rid of smart and they get rid of grant who were the two [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=420.04s)]
*  guys that he clashed with last year. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=422.68s)]
*  So they have cleared the fucking runway for this guy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=425.08s)]
*  They plowed all the snow off it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=430.2s)]
*  They changed the plane tires and they gave this guy a nice plane and we're [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=432.44s)]
*  going to find out if he's a good coach or not, because I have no idea if he is or not. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=436.4s)]
*  I don't. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  And we're so it doesn't either. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=441.67999999999995s)]
*  I will tell you that there are people that I trust that really do like him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=443.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  But there were, there were a few too many moments late in the season where, you [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=448.12s)]
*  know, I don't, I don't really love being super critical of the coaches because I [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  feel like there's all this stuff going on that we don't know about, but when the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  coach makes it easy to second guess them with some of the stuff and you're like, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=459.96s)]
*  what the fuck's going on? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  But I'm a big blame the player guys. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  Like they were pathetic against Miami to close those first two games. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=467.4s)]
*  And then in game three, you're going like, where's, where's the pride? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=471.96s)]
*  And then the pride actually shows. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=476.4s)]
*  Game two is the inexcusable one to me when Butler was just punking them and then [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  everybody got mad at Grant Williams after. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=481.24s)]
*  Listen, they're out of excuses. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  This is a seven year run now and they have, if not the most talented team, one of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  the most talented teams, Tatum's 26. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=490.96s)]
*  This is right at the time of his career and of a normal NBA star's career where [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=493.36s)]
*  you're supposed to peak 26, 27, 20, 29. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=497.56s)]
*  Jalen Brown got paid. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  Poor Zingas is in the single best basketball situation he's ever been in. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  And, and they have stuff to trade too. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=506.20000000000005s)]
*  They have picks that they can still move around and if they want to get slightly [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=508.72s)]
*  better, they will, they're spending a stupendous amount of money on this team. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=512.76s)]
*  This team is like a Golden State Warriors level expenditure, but it's, it's hard [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=516.6s)]
*  not to be super pumped. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=522.36s)]
*  I'll just tell you this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=523.44s)]
*  You guys know this because we've certainly all talked about enough, but I [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  couldn't watch that team play offense in the playoffs anymore. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=528.52s)]
*  The team that they had, I just couldn't do it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=531.2s)]
*  They had to change something. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=532.84s)]
*  I didn't know they would be as aggressive as they were, but I'm glad they were. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=534.52s)]
*  I think they had to be that way. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=537.64s)]
*  You can't be like, no, no, we're good every year because as we laid out last [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=539.2s)]
*  spring, the NBA, you can't just assume it's going to keep going. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=543.2s)]
*  You got to get aggressive. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=547.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Philadelphia 76ers can't say the same. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=549.04s)]
*  And they're over under is 47 and a half and it's dropped two wins. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=552.48s)]
*  And I still like the under. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=555.6s)]
*  This is a mess. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=558.08s)]
*  How's, can they say the season just, I don't, I hope they don't do this, but if [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=560.36s)]
*  this hardened thing is unfixable, like is there a scenario where they just move on [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=565.4s)]
*  from Darrell to try to save it? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=572.0s)]
*  Cause I feel like that scenario exists. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=574.24s)]
*  How does that help them? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=577.48s)]
*  Like what else do you do? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=578.12s)]
*  You have this Embiid window. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=578.96s)]
*  Well, if they reach the conclusion that by getting rid of Darrell, then [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=580.88s)]
*  Harden will stay and that, that he will be happy and be engaged for a year. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, they, they, they would have to like, dangle the extension [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=589.84s)]
*  that he thought he was getting. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=594.0s)]
*  Like they'd have to put that back on the table. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=595.6s)]
*  They should sell the team. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=597.44s)]
*  Well, I just have a hard time believing that the ownership's going, Darrell, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=600.72s)]
*  we should pay him. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  He's like, sorry. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=604.6s)]
*  Good point. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  So cosmetically, I guess, but that would then mean you would have to pay him. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=608.36s)]
*  And I wouldn't want to pay him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=615.36s)]
*  I would see, I would go back. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=616.96s)]
*  I would have that right side drive and game seven in Boston and see Harden go, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=618.56s)]
*  I don't want to be here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=625.48s)]
*  And I go, this is, this is why we're not paying him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=627.28s)]
*  You know, it's funny. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=629.56s)]
*  Russell's going to miss Harden when it's all over and Harden's retired. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=630.2s)]
*  Russell's like, you know what? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=633.72s)]
*  It was really fun to just, just complain about that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=634.64s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=637.36s)]
*  Cause a lot of it's the way he was officiated. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=637.84s)]
*  And I look back, I regret those hours. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  I regret all the hours that I put in. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=642.2s)]
*  Do you think Joel Embiid's saying the same thing? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=644.32s)]
*  When does he say, get me out of here? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  The only thing that matters for Philadelphia is just divining Joel Embiid's [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=648.52s)]
*  intentions and trying to figure out the best possible path to keeping him. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=653.28s)]
*  Yeah, because we can think Darrell is stubborn and I give him a lot of credit. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=658.0s)]
*  You know, you moved off of Ben Simmons who doesn't even play for Harden. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=661.32s)]
*  You had a chance, you know, there was a stretch last year. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=664.88s)]
*  We were like, Hey, look, they're in the conversation. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=667.16s)]
*  If something were to go their way. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=669.0s)]
*  I think we all agree as we've touched on earlier, Embiid kind of gets [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=670.7199999999999s)]
*  this collective pass about not being that successful in the playoffs where [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=673.36s)]
*  other guys with his profile would start really getting beat up on the talk shows. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not, it doesn't mean like, Hey guys, let's remind ourselves this [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=681.12s)]
*  year to shouldn't Embiid him more because I like them, you know what I mean? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=683.92s)]
*  Like I just haven't, I haven't really wanted to do that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=686.52s)]
*  Um, but there's some real proof that like some of the stuff I would say about [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=689.0799999999999s)]
*  Westbrook not getting out of the first round, like I could apply the same way [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=692.9599999999999s)]
*  to Embiid and the idea too, that if you have an old traditional center, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=695.84s)]
*  initiating your offense in crunch time, playoff possessions, does the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=701.2s)]
*  game even work that way anymore? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=704.84s)]
*  Especially over the course of two weeks, when you just get to watch every [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=706.24s)]
*  single thing, 400 minutes of it or whatever it is a little late on the doubles. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  There's still some stuff with him where I'm like, man, how can you not feel [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=714.12s)]
*  some of this pressure and all these different things happening? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=716.96s)]
*  So look, as much as we're sifting through the Embiid part of this and [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=718.64s)]
*  Darryl will be like, my price is my price. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=721.88s)]
*  And you know, all this different stuff, there may be a play here where with [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=724.8s)]
*  Simmons, it wasn't, it wasn't dire enough where it could be dire enough that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=729.64s)]
*  like there may be a move initiated based exactly how some, what you said about [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=737.12s)]
*  like making sure Embiid realizes we're on his side in this more so than [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=740.56s)]
*  hanging out for every last asset. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=745.04s)]
*  It would be interesting if Embiid just came out and was like, I'm fucking tired [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  of this, like I really want to win a title and they've got to fix this. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  I wonder how that would be. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  Cause part of it, you would go, yeah. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=757.5999999999999s)]
*  You, you, but I mean, direct it toward Harden and be like, you know what, man, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=759.5999999999999s)]
*  you opted in, like we were really good last year and the East is worse. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=762.5999999999999s)]
*  Like let's try to win a title together. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=766.64s)]
*  Stop bitching about all this other stuff. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=768.8s)]
*  Like we're right here. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=770.52s)]
*  We should have beaten Boston last year. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=771.3599999999999s)]
*  We have to play better. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=772.8s)]
*  You opted in. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=773.9599999999999s)]
*  Like you opted in, dude. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=775.24s)]
*  You want to, to make this money. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=777.0799999999999s)]
*  They got rid of the coach that you wanted them to get rid of. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=779.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  They brought in Nick Nurse who won a title for five years ago. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=782.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that's the very same conversation you guys are sort of walking through. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=785.4s)]
*  It could be the other way, like him going to management and saying, do [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  what it takes to keep James. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=793.16s)]
*  I like James. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=794.64s)]
*  James made me the mother effing MVP of the league. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=795.5999999999999s)]
*  We got very far into the- [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=798.52s)]
*  I'm positive. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=800.2399999999999s)]
*  He feels this way though. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=800.7199999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he feels this way though. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=802.4s)]
*  I don't think he feels this way. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  It's the, this is the question. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=804.2399999999999s)]
*  This is what I'm saying. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=805.68s)]
*  You got to divine his intentions. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=806.64s)]
*  What did he want? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=809.0s)]
*  Cause did you watch game six and game seven of the Boston series? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=809.4799999999999s)]
*  He was hurt. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=812.2399999999999s)]
*  He's going to say to everybody- [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=813.64s)]
*  James Harden was or Embiid? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=814.7199999999999s)]
*  No, Embiid. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=815.5999999999999s)]
*  So we didn't get the best version. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=816.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm saying did you see the James Harden part? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  But James Harden carried them into, to game six and game seven. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=818.68s)]
*  They weren't in that- [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=822.04s)]
*  Wow, he had two good games. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=822.76s)]
*  There was no competition otherwise without James Harden carrying them. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=823.16s)]
*  This is the James Harden truth though. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=827.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to tell you what the other side of this might look like, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=827.64s)]
*  but it's all up to Embiid. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=831.4s)]
*  It's Joel Embiid's call. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=833.0s)]
*  If he went to, to Maury and said, get it done with James Harden and let's go to war. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=834.52s)]
*  I mean, Nick Nurse, I think could figure out a way to make this work. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for Nurse. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=842.84s)]
*  Have you seen some of the stuff coming from there where they're, it's like kind of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=844.16s)]
*  veiled dock shots. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=848.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=850.28s)]
*  It's like a lot more movement this year. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=850.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=852.76s)]
*  It's going to be nice to be in an offense where the ball moves around. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=852.88s)]
*  Like it just like- [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=854.96s)]
*  No, no, I'm looking forward to Harden off the ball cutting. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=855.64s)]
*  Cause it was Doc, it was Doc holding him back. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=858.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=860.72s)]
*  No, Harden's, I mean, he moves like a lot, Janobely like, or he moves with that ball. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  I just love when like, they used to do the same shit with LeBron, like, oh, now he's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=867.1600000000001s)]
*  going to get out, like push the tempo. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=872.84s)]
*  Yeah, get out and just going to run way more. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=874.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=875.4000000000001s)]
*  Like he's way more athletic. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=875.64s)]
*  It's like, actually he's one of the slower paced guys because he's so good at [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=876.64s)]
*  dissecting what happens. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=880.36s)]
*  So you can talk about whatever you want to do. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=881.32s)]
*  The guy's going to default back to what he's comfortable with. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=883.64s)]
*  So that's what basketball is. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=885.44s)]
*  Especially as you get older. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=887.76s)]
*  Philly owns their own first round pick this year, but they can't really trade it [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=888.4399999999999s)]
*  because they have a protected pick to OKC in 25 and then another protected [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=893.16s)]
*  pick to Brooklyn in 27. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=897.16s)]
*  They have their own first in 29 and 30. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=899.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't really have a lot of avenues to improve this team. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=901.76s)]
*  I still feel like they should have gone after Dame because I, as I said, when it [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=905.3199999999999s)]
*  was happening, like I just thought they had a two or three year window here with [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=909.36s)]
*  Embiid and I don't think, I think the window might've slammed shut. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=912.88s)]
*  So you would have done Maxey and... [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=917.32s)]
*  I would have. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=918.96s)]
*  I would have tried to trade Maxey to a third team, tried to get those picks and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=919.44s)]
*  just tried to figure out some sort of package to try to get Dame with and put [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=923.88s)]
*  him with Embiid and see if I have a better chance. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=927.08s)]
*  But I think they're thinking we can turn Harden into more stuff. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  Keep Maxey. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  I just don't think they're going to be able to turn Harden into more stuff. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=934.96s)]
*  I don't think there's a deal for him. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=937.08s)]
*  I wonder how much the Simmons thing motivates Morrie to go like, well, look, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  everybody remember? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  Other GMs would have given in, other GMs would say, Hey, we just need to turn the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=943.2800000000001s)]
*  page on this thing. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  He waited and waited and waited. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=947.52s)]
*  But the difference is Harden is like one of the great saboteurs we've ever had in [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  any sport. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=954.36s)]
*  Like Ben Simmons just went to London and went to clubs and just like, he checked [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=954.88s)]
*  out and just like, Clutch will save me on this. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=958.68s)]
*  He's not disappearing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=961.6s)]
*  Harden's like, I'm going to be here and you guys are all going to be fucking [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=962.48s)]
*  miserable and every like three days I'm going to do something. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=965.12s)]
*  Cause he knows how to do this. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=967.76s)]
*  So it's different though, because he still is hoping for the contract. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=969.88s)]
*  So unless he thinks that's why I just can't wait. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=973.4s)]
*  I can't wait to see what's going to happen. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=976.92s)]
*  Like, is he going to actually sabotage the situation to get out then while also [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=978.32s)]
*  demanding a new deal worth $180 million? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=981.92s)]
*  He also doesn't seem to understand that the other 29 teams in the league have [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=985.48s)]
*  watched the behavior, right? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=991.2s)]
*  So it's like, if you have some neighbor and they had a dog and you saw the dog [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=993.48s)]
*  attack multiple neighbors, right? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=999.08s)]
*  And the neighbor came to him and was like, do you want to adopt my dog? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1001.24s)]
*  Really nice looking German shepherd. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1003.88s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1006.28s)]
*  I just. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1007.24s)]
*  Talk about Biden's dog. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1007.56s)]
*  I mean, I know we don't talk politics. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1010.92s)]
*  Commander Biden. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1013.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1014.4s)]
*  Biden comes to you. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1014.8s)]
*  It was like, Hey, commander Joe, can we talk about your dog? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1015.6s)]
*  He bit at least 11 secret service agents. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1019.6s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, at some point the behavior is the behavior and the other [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1022.64s)]
*  team see this and like, well, we trade for this guy. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1026.16s)]
*  Well, what if he becomes unhappy in three months? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1028.44s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1030.36s)]
*  But I don't think, I think when you're really this special and you've been this [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1031.24s)]
*  special at something for this long and it's actually gone your way so many times. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1034.48s)]
*  People just talk themselves into it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1039.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1041.2s)]
*  And I also think like, look, there's, there's a sense around the league too, that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1041.3999999999999s)]
*  the agents that he's working with, like if you had a clutch, if you had one of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1048.44s)]
*  the, one of the, like the real foundational agents, then maybe like this is [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1054.76s)]
*  power. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1059.56s)]
*  This is the part of the agent game that most of us overlook or don't understand. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1060.0s)]
*  Is that like, when there's a guy who's really valuable to a team that opens up [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1064.48s)]
*  doors for like the agent to have power with that team. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1070.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1074.12s)]
*  And you know, everyone looked at Lamar Jackson's deal and said, Oh, remember all [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1074.96s)]
*  of you that said he needed an agent. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1079.76s)]
*  And it's like, well, he still didn't really get what he wanted. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1081.1599999999999s)]
*  He wanted to be traded. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1083.24s)]
*  And if you want to be traded, you have to have something that your agent can like [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1085.0s)]
*  barter, meaning other clients or hate down the road, because as you know, and I [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1090.28s)]
*  know you hate it and we argue about all the time, like there are simply just [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  transactions done where the team does the agent a favor and it probably doesn't [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1096.6799999999998s)]
*  come back to pay them back as much as they would hope, but they still keep that [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1101.0s)]
*  line of communication open. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1104.12s)]
*  So if you're trying to manipulate this a third time and not have the agent that [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1105.4399999999998s)]
*  maybe has the most intense client list, it's an even harder thing to pull off. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1113.9199999999998s)]
*  While on top of it, not being as desired as he was in the past. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1114.36s)]
*  They started nine and nine last year house and went 45 and 19, won 54 games. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1119.6799999999998s)]
*  They were basically the team with the best record in the league for the last [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1125.52s)]
*  three fourths of the season. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1129.6s)]
*  Hard to miss 24 games, Maximus 22 and bead miss 16. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1131.56s)]
*  That's a ton of wins for how many games? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1135.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1137.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1137.52s)]
*  So it's dropped enough that I'm not positive. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1138.04s)]
*  It's a lock for me. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  It was a lock at 49 and a half. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1144.2s)]
*  Cause I was like, they're not winning 50 games. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1145.96s)]
*  That's ludicrous. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1148.08s)]
*  But the 47 happened to bad conference. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  It's still a hard under for me. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1150.72s)]
*  You guys are under. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1152.12s)]
*  I just, it's a bit like my Kings or excuse me. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1153.56s)]
*  It's a lot like my Clippers pick where I'm not going to be wrong on the over [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1155.8799999999999s)]
*  right. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1160.0s)]
*  Knowing what could potentially happen here. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1160.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1162.68s)]
*  And there's what a four to one chance and bead gets mad in January. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1163.24s)]
*  And it's like, you know what? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1167.44s)]
*  We've run our course here. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1168.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1169.4s)]
*  But if Darrell still the GM, that doesn't mean anything. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1169.6s)]
*  You're not just going to trade them for nothing. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1172.72s)]
*  I just think like, Oh, Hey, we're going into it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1174.2s)]
*  We're not quite sure which way James Harden's leaning. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1176.8s)]
*  Then how, how do you take the over? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1179.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1182.3600000000001s)]
*  The Knicks were 47 and 35 last year and the over under for them for some reason [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1182.6000000000001s)]
*  has dropped by a win and a half. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1186.88s)]
*  Even though the conference got worse, they had the pretty much exact same team [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1188.24s)]
*  that last year they added a D Finchenzo and, uh, they signed Josh Hart and it [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1193.04s)]
*  just seems, I don't know why their record would be worse. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1199.12s)]
*  I guess the question for me is what's the next move for this team? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1203.6s)]
*  Because they don't have enough to win a title. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1207.04s)]
*  They're kind of on the hold for, can they get Janice? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1208.6799999999998s)]
*  Can they get Mitchell? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  What if and B becomes available? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's this two parallel passive. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1214.8799999999999s)]
*  We're really good four or five seed, but we're probably not getting it at around [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1216.56s)]
*  two, but we're also kind of asset maintaining all these dudes in case something bigger [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1220.32s)]
*  happens. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  That makes me a little nervous with the over under, but Rossello I'm, I'm [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1227.96s)]
*  going over 45 and a half. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1231.16s)]
*  I think this is at least a 46 win team. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1232.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1235.28s)]
*  It's part of the Tibbs deal where at some point last year it felt like he was done. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1235.44s)]
*  That was definitely had a lot of momentum when you think about like certain things [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1240.28s)]
*  you'll hear over the course of a season. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1244.44s)]
*  Uh, it looked like his days were numbered. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1246.68s)]
*  Not even the case. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1248.4s)]
*  Jaylen Brunson was so far beyond, like we knew he was good. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1249.48s)]
*  This was absurd. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1253.28s)]
*  What he did to the Cavs in the playoffs. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1254.28s)]
*  And you know, you look at him and go, okay, well who's that number two that makes [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1257.04s)]
*  them good enough to feel like they're in that first tier of the East. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1261.04s)]
*  They're just not, they're not, but they're one through eight is pretty good. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1263.08s)]
*  And you know, it's it, I hate to bring them up again because I spent so much time on [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1266.56s)]
*  him too much time on him last year. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1271.52s)]
*  But I think the hope is that Barrett is something that's either tradable or is the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1273.28s)]
*  defining number two, three guy with Julius Randall. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1277.48s)]
*  Playoff stuff with him though that I think we both liked. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1280.44s)]
*  Yeah, but the shooting across the board was down dramatically. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1282.48s)]
*  I mean, he was 40% from three, two years ago. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1286.28s)]
*  He was 31% with a 34 in between that. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1288.56s)]
*  Um, and you know, look, I brought it up constantly. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1291.76s)]
*  I thought it was really weird. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1294.56s)]
*  Like the way they was sub them out. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1295.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1297.16s)]
*  They were doing kind of lamello like, yeah, sure. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1297.56s)]
*  You're playing in the fourth quarter, buddy, but you aren't. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1299.92s)]
*  And they would get weird on the patterns there. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1303.04s)]
*  I just, for them to feel better about their situation, he needs to finally put [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  it together at 23, which usually this means four seasons in this is who he is. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1309.2s)]
*  Or that he does enough that he's actually valuable enough for whatever [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1313.92s)]
*  that next move is, but good luck. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1316.68s)]
*  House. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1319.04s)]
*  They started 10 and 13. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1319.44s)]
*  They finished 37 and 22, which is a hell of 50 win pace and everybody's back. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1322.24s)]
*  Why aren't we going over with this thing? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1327.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that we are. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1329.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1330.96s)]
*  I love the 17 and eight that they went with Josh Hart. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1331.28s)]
*  I love what, you know, there's a force multiplier kind of effect with this [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1333.96s)]
*  team in terms of when Hart arrived. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1337.56s)]
*  It delivered an identity to the team. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1340.28s)]
*  And then this D Vicenzo edition, which is like, he feels like, yeah, great. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1342.76s)]
*  But no, that's another Villanova guy. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1347.52s)]
*  And there's a whole thing going on, like a whole subtext of this rallying. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1349.8799999999999s)]
*  Like the town loves this team and they got to figure out what happens with [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1355.4s)]
*  Julius Randall, but they have tons of flexibility in terms of picks and talent [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1362.08s)]
*  to land, you know, if, if, uh, Toronto decides to be a seller, I expect the [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1369.8400000000001s)]
*  Knicks to be all in on this. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1374.3200000000002s)]
*  So they're, they're a super over for me this year. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1376.88s)]
*  Randall's last five years, 22, 10 and four, one second team, all NBA, one [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1379.8s)]
*  third team, all NBA, and he only missed 33 games. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1386.3200000000002s)]
*  There's a case. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1391.3200000000002s)]
*  He's like the most underrated guy in the league. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1391.88s)]
*  Nobody's like, you know, I fucking love Julius Randall, you know, and [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1393.68s)]
*  I fell out of love with him in the Miami series. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1397.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1399.4s)]
*  But he was also, then it turned out he was playing on a bad enough ankle that [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1399.96s)]
*  they had had surgery for it, you know? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1403.72s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1406.0s)]
*  Cause whenever we do the all NBA stuff, I'm like, wait, I think I have to vote him. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1413.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1414.0400000000002s)]
*  I have to vote him in and then you're right. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1414.2800000000002s)]
*  He plays all the time. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, there was that year where he was going to be eligible for contract [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1416.6000000000001s)]
*  extension and he took the money instead of waiting it out like another year, but [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1420.48s)]
*  it was still such a huge number that you're like, okay, it kind of makes sense. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1424.64s)]
*  And then when he did it was like, oh, it was good that he did it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1427.36s)]
*  Cause he had taken a dip down. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1429.84s)]
*  He's just always a strange player. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1430.84s)]
*  He's just always going to be a strange, like, wow, that guy's numbers are way [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1432.28s)]
*  better than I think they are, but in a big game, am I actually afraid of Julius [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1435.8s)]
*  Randall and the answers probably no. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1439.1999999999998s)]
*  You had Shamit face that you created. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1441.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1444.08s)]
*  Randall face is like a different kind of face. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1445.32s)]
*  Like he's one of those guys. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1447.52s)]
*  He'd almost be better playing with a hockey mask. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1448.56s)]
*  So we wouldn't see he's, he's got expressions that just make you think [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1451.0s)]
*  things are going badly or he's unhappy. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1454.8s)]
*  But it's just kind of his face. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1456.96s)]
*  It's a great call. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1459.16s)]
*  Cause Shamit face has a face that you'd be willing to like overlook. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1459.8s)]
*  You're like, well, that guy can't be good. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1463.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1464.8s)]
*  You have to win me over because I don't trust your face. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1465.44s)]
*  Randall face just shares too much. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1468.72s)]
*  Cause like when it's not going right and he's in the building, like that got really [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1471.08s)]
*  weird at points last year where it felt like the city and the crowd was turning [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1475.44s)]
*  on him and look, I know that he was hurt, but I would say that there were enough [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1479.0s)]
*  moments where he could do stuff in that Miami series is like, okay, so you're [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1484.1599999999999s)]
*  hurt when all the bad things are happening, but you're healthy enough when [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1488.32s)]
*  all the good things are happening there. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1492.4399999999998s)]
*  So maybe he grows a giant beard, like a hardened beard. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  They have a lot of first round picks. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  They have all their own picks. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1499.4799999999998s)]
*  Dallas is protected first, top 10 Detroit's protected first, top 18, top 13, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1501.1999999999998s)]
*  top 11, top nine, those are the protections. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1506.6799999999998s)]
*  Washington's first top 12 next year. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1509.4799999999998s)]
*  I think you'll be keeping that one house. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1513.24s)]
*  We're keeping that top 10 and 25, top eight and 26. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1514.64s)]
*  And then they have Milwaukee's first top four protected. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1517.88s)]
*  So they can mobilize pretty fast with some packages and some things. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1520.92s)]
*  It'd be funny if the Mitchell thing. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1525.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't think the Cavs would do that that way, especially [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1526.88s)]
*  knowing like with Mitchell. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1530.16s)]
*  I mean, Mitchell would have to force the issue. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1531.6s)]
*  So Mitchell would have to say, Hey, we're the one and one left. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1533.64s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1535.96s)]
*  Which is a little different than if you're just going to straight up be a free agent. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1537.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1540.1200000000001s)]
*  And then I don't know how many times you're going to keep reading the, the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1540.32s)]
*  Nixon monitor in Carl Anthony Townsend. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1544.0s)]
*  And this has been going on for like five years. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1545.96s)]
*  I don't even think it's true. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1548.32s)]
*  They, they're run by Kentucky people. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1550.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think they. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1553.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, but that was the thing is that supposedly like all [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1554.52s)]
*  of this was going to pay off. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1556.6799999999998s)]
*  And it, you know, they've done a really good job with, with what they have to [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1558.28s)]
*  this point, but landing that big guy and they could have done the Mitchell trade. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1563.28s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1567.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh, I don't think they believed that they had enough competition for it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1568.8799999999999s)]
*  So they thought they're going to maybe get their way and look, they end up [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1571.84s)]
*  eliminating the guy, you know, when, when going into that series last year, I was [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  like, come on, Cleveland's going to be better than New York. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1577.52s)]
*  And it was, it was kind of humiliating the way they beat Cleveland. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1579.32s)]
*  I thought, you know, who I think is going to have a huge year for Nia. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1582.28s)]
*  No, I didn't just find a wake up for someone. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1587.28s)]
*  Um, Brooklyn nets 37 and a half. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1589.2s)]
*  They are plus one 52 for the playoffs. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1594.9199999999998s)]
*  I personally think they blew it, not going for Dame Lillard. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1598.6799999999998s)]
*  So here's where it gets tough because I don't like this team and they are making [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1602.2s)]
*  Ben Simmons, the point forward and Spencer Dinwiddie has had some [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1606.3999999999999s)]
*  thoughts about this already. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1609.96s)]
*  He's positive about it, but you know, he had the car keys last year and now Ben's [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1611.08s)]
*  going to have the car keys, so he's going to have to learn to adjust off the ball. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1614.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, and we had workout videos posted again. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1618.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1621.3999999999999s)]
*  There's been some workout videos. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1621.96s)]
*  They don't have their first round pick this year. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1624.24s)]
*  It goes to Houston. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1627.0s)]
*  So they don't have really any incentive to be bad, but I asked, I [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1628.48s)]
*  don't think they're very good. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1631.6799999999998s)]
*  You're talking Dinwiddie Simmons, Miles Bridges, Cam Johnston, Nick's [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1633.36s)]
*  Claxton, Nick Claxton, Phinney Smiths in there. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1638.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh Neil. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1641.6799999999998s)]
*  They're fine. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1642.24s)]
*  It's a perfectly serve Lonnie Walker's in there now. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1642.9199999999998s)]
*  Perfectly serviceable team. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1645.48s)]
*  Um, I just, is it okay if I just never believe in Ben Simmons again? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1647.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was funny. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1653.48s)]
*  I'd rather believe in my Ben Simmons, but I'm not going to believe in the other [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1654.24s)]
*  Ben Simmons because I was thinking about like clean slate program. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1656.68s)]
*  Like, could we just each have three guys where you go, we have to, we have to be [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1660.28s)]
*  clean slate, we can't bring up any of the shit anymore. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  So Randall would be a good one for you for clean slate program. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1666.68s)]
*  No. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1669.5600000000002s)]
*  Cause when I did that deep dive on him, where I just watched him for an entire [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1669.88s)]
*  Miami game, cause I was having like a hard time with that series where I go, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1673.72s)]
*  I'm just going to watch him. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1677.3200000000002s)]
*  And boy, did I end up not liking him after a couple of those games. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1679.2s)]
*  But yeah, if I just said Ben Simmons, clean slate program, I can't bring up [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1682.0s)]
*  anything in the past. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1686.64s)]
*  I have to go in with a totally like open mind. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1687.92s)]
*  I have to, I have to be like an NBA writer that has a profile on him. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1690.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1693.68s)]
*  Where I'm like, this guy gets it right around the corner. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1693.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1697.16s)]
*  Could you do it? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1697.88s)]
*  Could you do it with Russell Westbrook? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1698.5600000000002s)]
*  I think Westbrook's like, you can't do it anymore. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1699.76s)]
*  Harden. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1701.76s)]
*  I would not allow that content to be taken from me. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1702.0400000000002s)]
*  Could you do a clean slate deal with Ben Simmons starting now? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1705.3200000000002s)]
*  I challenge you. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1708.24s)]
*  I don't know how he looks at politically yet. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1709.8400000000001s)]
*  Cause the guy that played for the Sixers until the fateful Atlanta series was just [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1712.52s)]
*  athletically a specimen who I think was one of the best athletes in the league and [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1718.36s)]
*  was an awesome defensive player. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1724.4799999999998s)]
*  And I don't, is that guy still exists? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1725.84s)]
*  So if you're telling me that guy's back and mentally there's some stuff going on, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  but at least the athlete part is back. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1732.32s)]
*  I could talk myself into it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1734.6799999999998s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1737.52s)]
*  I, when somebody doesn't play for how many years was that? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1738.9199999999998s)]
*  Two and a half? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1741.56s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, kinda. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1743.36s)]
*  I mean, I think there's- [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1745.08s)]
*  You're going spring of 2021, throw away the 22, 23, he was a zombie. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1745.6s)]
*  So it's been- [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1752.1599999999999s)]
*  It's literally an all time, I don't know. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1753.4799999999998s)]
*  We have no way to- [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1756.36s)]
*  But we might know. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1757.6799999999998s)]
*  There might, deep down we all might know. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1758.4399999999998s)]
*  The big question is, does he like to play professional basketball? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1761.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm really glad you asked that. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1764.1999999999998s)]
*  The answer has been probably not for a while here. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1765.76s)]
*  Doesn't seem like it. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1768.4799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1769.4399999999998s)]
*  But what if he decides that he does? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1770.2s)]
*  He's really good at saying all the right things when basketball isn't scheduled. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1773.08s)]
*  Like August, great quotes. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1780.76s)]
*  Look, if it were just his health, that'd be one thing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1783.32s)]
*  I think he is mentally shot. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1785.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1787.84s)]
*  No coming back. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1788.84s)]
*  He's a kid though. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1789.52s)]
*  Well, that determines the over under because if you don't think he's going to be good for them this year, I don't see how they hit the over. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1791.08s)]
*  I don't think- [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1797.04s)]
*  He was still getting- [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1797.56s)]
*  I think they're 35 and 47. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1798.24s)]
*  Remember, I think it was a Boston game where he had a million assists in the first half and they actually took him out of the rotation to close the game because it was getting a little tighter and he was starting to revert to, I don't really want to make decisions here with the ball. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1799.72s)]
*  And they ended up yanking him from him. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1813.88s)]
*  Now if that's because of his back, okay. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1815.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what he tells us all the time and that he's back and he's ready to go. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1818.56s)]
*  I think the biggest thing with Brooklyn here is they built up so much equity despite the weird turnover they had with Kyrie. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1821.84s)]
*  They were 11, 12 games over 500. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1828.48s)]
*  They make that trade. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1831.32s)]
*  They basically play like three to four games under 500 with this group for the rest of the way, but they still held onto a sixth seed. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1833.12s)]
*  So I think the overplay- [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1841.72s)]
*  Chat that mind trick. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1843.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1843.72s)]
*  So I'm going under. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1844.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1845.24s)]
*  I came to the same conclusion because that one KD Kyrie squad stretch skewed their record and I think they're a 35 win team. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1845.84s)]
*  We kept thinking they were going to fall apart, but their record was already built in to protect against it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1854.6s)]
*  And then everybody else around that seeding was a game or two or below 500. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1860.92s)]
*  I really like Mikael Bridges, but if he's your number one guy and the last guy in the Jumbotron video as you're introducing the starters, the guy who's got the talcum powder, he's like, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1866.3999999999999s)]
*  blows it out and then fireworks go off. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1879.24s)]
*  I'm not that excited about my team. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1881.92s)]
*  And again, I really like Mikael Bridges, but I love me that he's great. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1883.64s)]
*  That's your guy. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1887.2s)]
*  He's showing the ceiling for him is even further than what we thought it could be. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1888.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1892.3600000000001s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1892.68s)]
*  He's like, I would say I would put them above Jalen Brown, but if Jalen Brown was the best guy in this Brooklyn Nets team, I would think they're going to win 34 games. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1893.24s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1901.52s)]
*  House, you're in on the ender as well. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1903.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in on the ender. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1904.56s)]
*  I feel bad. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1907.0800000000002s)]
*  I can't, I can't invest in Din Shitty. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1908.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1912.24s)]
*  Well, that's some Washington bad blood. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1912.9199999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1914.32s)]
*  You're right about that. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1914.9599999999998s)]
*  It would have been, this would have been a fun name team. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1917.24s)]
*  I like how it worked out. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1919.76s)]
*  It's more fun to have them on Milwaukee, but it would have been fun if they just said, fuck it and went after him. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1920.76s)]
*  Toronto, 36 and a half. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1925.1599999999999s)]
*  They have a new coach. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1927.24s)]
*  New attitude. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1929.6s)]
*  They replaced Van Vliet with Dennis Schroeder. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1930.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1936.6399999999999s)]
*  They brought in Grady Dick. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1937.12s)]
*  They owe a top six protected first to San Antonio. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1940.2s)]
*  So the question is, how good do you want to be? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1945.72s)]
*  Does that mean they'll tank? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1949.32s)]
*  My guess is they're probably going to try to be good. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1950.52s)]
*  I kind of like the team. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1953.48s)]
*  They're 41 and 41 last year. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1954.56s)]
*  I don't understand why it's five wins worse when really the only thing that changed was they turned Van Vliet into Schroeder. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1956.24s)]
*  And again, I kind of like Schroeder. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1962.64s)]
*  I thought he was good on the Lakers last year. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1963.88s)]
*  Their chemistry was clearly off. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1966.6000000000001s)]
*  They clashed. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1968.0s)]
*  They clashed. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1968.6000000000001s)]
*  Their chemistry was clearly off. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1969.0s)]
*  They clearly needed a coach change. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1970.2s)]
*  Rossello, it's an over for me. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1972.4s)]
*  And I have them in the playoffs, I think. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1974.96s)]
*  I'm going under. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1977.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1978.6s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1979.04s)]
*  I do think Van Vliet was that important. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1979.92s)]
*  Although Van Vliet's a weird player where there's all these other like baked in advanced stats that tell you he was actually like terrible. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1982.16s)]
*  Well, the problem is there was like, man, they had such bad luck in the clutch last year. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1987.92s)]
*  And it was like, maybe they had bad luck because Fred Van Vliet was deciding every game for them, playing against like Steph Curry and Nicole Jokic. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1992.2s)]
*  I also think there was some like massive three point percentage number against them that was like absurd. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=1998.24s)]
*  So that would speak to your over call and all this. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2004.0s)]
*  But I think Van Vliet was just really, really steady for him. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2007.72s)]
*  And Schroeder I've had about seven different relationships with. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2012.1200000000001s)]
*  We've never been better, me and Dennis. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2015.96s)]
*  We broke up. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2019.56s)]
*  He moved out. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2020.4s)]
*  He's back in. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2021.28s)]
*  We're doing great. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2022.04s)]
*  A lot of the young guys that I've liked on this team, like I needed to be better. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2022.88s)]
*  It's kind of like a collective Evan Mobley team where there's a couple of dudes like OG and Inobi is going into the Hall of Fame, obviously, for who he won't be traded for. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2026.6s)]
*  And I think we all kind of like them. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2035.68s)]
*  But like some of the stuff you'd hear about, like who he wasn't offered for you. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2037.8s)]
*  Like, wait, is that is there another one that I'm not aware of? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2040.52s)]
*  Well, you have a lot of barn stock. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2043.68s)]
*  I do, but. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2045.88s)]
*  And he wasn't good last year for what we thought. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2046.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm also like willing to admit. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2048.76s)]
*  Hey, I got to see like some of the stuff like what do you go to that's really tough to defend? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2051.56s)]
*  Not, hey, do you get 15 shots a game? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2056.88s)]
*  Do you have something that's really tough? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2059.1200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I think he and Mobley, it'd be nice if we saw something this year. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2060.48s)]
*  What do you got to ask? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2064.6800000000003s)]
*  I mentioned in part one about how I'm a petty better and I really don't forgive easily when a team burns me. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2066.04s)]
*  This team underperformed by such a significant amount last year. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2075.4s)]
*  And I'm sick of their shit, to be honest with you. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2079.68s)]
*  Having said all that, I'm on the over because I think that they are a 37 win team with the talent. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2083.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, the problem is that they had an identity and it was a successful identity and they could be a 45 or 46 win team in the East. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2090.3999999999996s)]
*  If they maintain that identity for whatever reason, they decided, it seems as a group to not continue to bang the hell out of the offensive boards. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2099.2s)]
*  To push their perimeter defense all the way out to play relentlessly. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2108.68s)]
*  They have this collection of guys, nobody that was taller than 6'10". [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2112.88s)]
*  And that was the game plan and it really worked. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2117.32s)]
*  They had 45 or 46 wins. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2119.44s)]
*  They came in last year, forecasted around that slightly under it. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2120.96s)]
*  I was like, wait a minute. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2125.12s)]
*  I love the way that this team plays. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2126.12s)]
*  Nick Nurse has them cooking. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2127.88s)]
*  They have a good identity. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2129.8s)]
*  They're an inside outside kind of team. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2131.12s)]
*  And collectively, for whatever reason, they're like, fuck it, this is too hard. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2133.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't want to do this anymore. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2137.76s)]
*  And they stopped playing the kind of relentless defense that they had the previous season. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2139.36s)]
*  They got really surly. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2147.48s)]
*  Like Siakam was always pissed about stuff. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2148.68s)]
*  It felt like. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2151.0s)]
*  And then would you see the Messiah quotes about we were selfish last year and he was basically, you know, and that's what needs to change. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2151.64s)]
*  It's like, who are you talking about? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2159.68s)]
*  Your every basketball team is run by four people. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2160.84s)]
*  One of the best preparation guys, adjustment guys, other basketball people rave about Nick Nurse all the time. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2163.4s)]
*  So I kind of wanted to go over, you know, like they're not. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2172.28s)]
*  There's no way they're that far off from 40 wins or whatever. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2177.2400000000002s)]
*  But I just don't know why in a first year, a new guy coming in, like this could be the part of the demise for the Raptors where it's like, you know, they had these pieces that were left over. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2180.36s)]
*  Lowry's gone. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2189.52s)]
*  Van Vliet's gone. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2190.2000000000003s)]
*  Maybe it's Siakam and these younger players that I've all kind of like, I'll throw precious in the mix too. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2191.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2196.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, I mean, eventually I ask myself, like, how come you still like this guy so fucking much? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2197.2s)]
*  I think Schroeder could be good on this team. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2203.12s)]
*  I really like the fit and I wouldn't like him on most teams, I don't think. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2205.6s)]
*  But even in the world championships, like they built that whole Germany team around him and Franz and he was cooking like that. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2209.2s)]
*  I thought in the playoffs series, I thought he really bothered the Warriors. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2217.52s)]
*  I thought he did a nice job on Lowry. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2221.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2222.72s)]
*  I thought he did a really nice job on Jamal when they, you know, Jamal was awesome in the playoffs, but they were one of the key moments that happened in one of those Denver games was, didn't he get kicked out? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2223.24s)]
*  He got a second, he got into it with somebody or maybe it was going steady. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2236.04s)]
*  He got kicked out of one game and you could feel the difference with the Lakers. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2238.7599999999998s)]
*  Like he was like a pit bull in those series. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2241.3199999999997s)]
*  I just think he's going to, you know, he's a really smart kind of old school foreign point guard. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2244.0s)]
*  So you're going to take it over? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2251.24s)]
*  I'm taking over. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2252.36s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I have them in the playoffs. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2253.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2255.4s)]
*  I think they're going to be all right. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2256.16s)]
*  I have them over. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2257.16s)]
*  Grady Dick, excitement level. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2258.72s)]
*  Is there a white guy resurgence right now? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2261.12s)]
*  Prichard gets a contract, Grady Dick, teams want TJ McConnell, Heroes got a chip on his shoulder. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2262.88s)]
*  Hayward's expiring? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  Kevin Love's back with Miami, Hayward expiring. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2269.3199999999997s)]
*  Or white guy's back. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2272.04s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2274.24s)]
*  OK. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6H393x3To&t=2274.7599999999998s)]
