# The Knicks and the Lakers Need to Make Some Trades | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKpSiJbwbsg)
*  Well, let's jump ahead to the next because I think that's a good DeRozan destination.
*  Yeah.
*  You put him with Brunson, who's this old school, you know, just playoff type of guard.
*  And then Rando, who's a little bit of an unusual player too.
*  And then you put DeRozan with them, basically in that two guard spot, which they've been
*  floating around on.
*  I just think that'd be really hard for him to play.
*  And I don't know if Barrett, Barrett, they have some issues because he's a poison pill
*  guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't get creative with that.
*  If that team, if you're trading, like if Chicago trades other guys and they cut some salary,
*  maybe it's a little bit easier.
*  But I just like that.
*  I don't think the Knicks are that far away.
*  17 and 13.
*  I have them as number 12 on my board right now, which I couldn't believe as I was doing
*  the teams.
*  Defensively, they starting to feel a little bit more like a tips team.
*  I think they're fun to watch.
*  I think Brunson's been awesome for them.
*  He's been great.
*  And I'm honestly not surprised.
*  Are you?
*  Like, oh my God, I wonder if Brunson's going to be good in the Knicks.
*  Like, I was all in on Brunson.
*  I felt like we got enough of a sample size of them in Dallas.
*  I was still a little surprised that people didn't realize how important he was to Dallas
*  last year, just in a variety of ways.
*  But if you had one more playoff score to that team, I don't know, that East is after the
*  top two.
*  I just feel like it drops.
*  I think what makes them tough to read is they've been playing great lately, especially like
*  you look over the last like 15 games or so.
*  Their starters have been one of the best high usage lineups in the NBA.
*  That's a great sign in terms of if you're like banking on what this group is moving
*  forward, it's hard to give that up.
*  It's hard to give up.
*  You look even just recently in this game against the Pacers this week.
*  I think that's as good as Randall and Brunson and Barrett have all played at the same time.
*  And so you're like, okay, this is finally clicking.
*  This is finally here.
*  And so either you're thinking trade to bring someone in to get better and potentially disrupt
*  that very precarious balance you're starting to build.
*  Or do we really trust that that balance is real?
*  Is this something that is going somewhere where you would be dissuaded from trading
*  away Julius Randall down the line or making some other kind of shakeup?
*  For as good as the Knicks have been, and this is a harsh thing to say for a team that's
*  on a win streak, but I just still don't think this still feels like a team that needs to
*  be reimagined to me, even with as well as they're playing, even with as good as they've
*  been defensively.
*  You need to be doing one of two things.
*  Do you trust this team to be good and stable long term?
*  Or do you trust them to compete for a championship right now?
*  And I think they're closer to the former than the latter, but I don't really trust the long
*  term prospects of this group either.
*  Well, what's fun about them for somebody like in the DeRozan salary range, they got Rose
*  at 14.5, basically in expiring, and then Reddish at six.
*  So I'm already at 21.
*  I'm already like one more contract that can just get DeRozan.
*  I don't really have to touch anybody.
*  Good. They have a lot of picks.
*  They have their own first for the next seven years.
*  They have protected first from Washington walking to trade.
*  They have a top 10 protected first from Dallas.
*  So they could just throw some stuff without really touching Toppin or any of their guys
*  that are playing for them and then save the other stuff for a second trade if they wanted
*  to.
*  I'm a little more bullish on the Knicks adding a piece because not even like for whether
*  you and I think it's a good idea.
*  I just feel like the guys that run that team, they're in year three.
*  It's kind of a shitter get off the pot thing with Tibbs.
*  Sure.
*  And I think you kind of have to find out now the way this can go wrong is the way one won
*  for Chicago, right?
*  Where they're the same thing.
*  Oh, we're a little shit off.
*  Get her the pot.
*  All right, let's go get Vusovic.
*  And now you see where that went.
*  Maybe they miscalculated that in this case.
*  I do feel like you can get somebody good without really touching who you have.
*  And I think the fans want it.
*  Like I think, you know, I think one of the things they have going for them is even if
*  they can try to be a top five team in the East and get some home energy for these games.
*  And they've unlocked Randall is the most important thing that they did.
*  I don't know what's going to happen with Barrett.
*  He's been up and down every time I watch him.
*  He either looks terrible or he looks pretty good, but he doesn't look like the guy from
*  last year.
*  But Randall does not look like the guy from last year.
*  Randall is back pretty close to the guy from two years ago, right?
*  He's had some really good stretches and like there are points defensively where you could
*  really zero in on what he wasn't doing or being out of position and like really pick
*  at that.
*  I do think he's been better.
*  I do think I mean, obviously, collectively, they've been so much better defensively.
*  And if they can, you're right, like you are right.
*  If they can get a little bit more punch, they can be a really solid team for this season.
*  I'm just not sure if like that's what you want to push in for with a guy like DeRozan, for
*  example, who what I love about DeRozan as a potential fit for them is he would be so
*  good anchoring second units, like playing without the other other stars for New York,
*  without their other best players and really elevating some of those groups.
*  Right.
*  But the idea of, you know, even even given everything I said about him being very good
*  in limited space, putting him alongside this starting lineup in the Quinton Grimes spot
*  effectively like Barrett cannot shoot.
*  Julius Randall is pretty up and down in terms of what he gives you in terms of spacing.
*  So you're really banking very hard on Jalen Brunson basically as being like a good spacer
*  in the situations where you actually want DeRozan driving your offense.
*  And that's that's OK.
*  It makes me a little nervous, though.
*  Can I give you R.J.
*  Barrett's destiny in this situation?
*  Please.
*  I'd like to introduce you to the six man award.
*  Now go try to win it.
*  Hey, look at Tyler here and Jordan Clarkson.
*  You're going to come in Jordan Poole, 12 minutes a half.
*  Just kind of go nuts for us.
*  The Randall stuff since after Thanksgiving.
*  It's 27 and 10.
*  It's a bunch of 30 point games like he's he's he's back in the mix.
*  The Davis I do this every year in the podcast with somebody who hurts their foot.
*  And I think I'm batting a thousand with this prediction where they're always like,
*  it's going to be about a month.
*  It's like, OK.
*  Yeah, we'll we'll see.
*  Because with feet, especially, it always seems like it's six weeks, eight weeks.
*  And for bigs, for bigs, especially bigs.
*  I just nobody's getting rushed back with a weird foot situation.
*  And it doesn't seem like it's a sprained foot.
*  It seems like it's worse.
*  But he's a guy who even when he comes back, even if he did come back at the earliest
*  possible timeline, the way Anthony Davis was playing, you need absolute confidence
*  and comfort with your body to move like that, to contest shots like that, to be as
*  aggressive as he was going to the rim.
*  I think it's possible that even when he comes back, we're not going to see that
*  version of AD for a while, that he's going to have to kind of ease back into things.
*  And so what we're talking about in terms of the overall scope of the Lakers season
*  is they need help.
*  They need help in a really bad way.
*  And they don't really have the option to go the other direction.
*  Like they have to they have to be pushing forward.
*  Counter.
*  If he's gone for six, eight, nine weeks, you're 13 and 17 anyway.
*  And your team now, LeBron is the hub of the team who's in year 20, who has basically
*  been missing 25 to 30 games the last couple of years.
*  The moment he gets hurt, your season's over.
*  So why am I giving away my entire future to hold the fort so that I can get Anthony
*  Davis coming off a major injury, semi major and then old LeBron?
*  And where am I going anyway?
*  Am I as good as the top seven teams in the league with that nucleus?
*  And you saw the other night.
*  Now the Boston game was really interesting for a variety of reasons.
*  Darwin Ham says, fuck it.
*  He plays Russian roulette with Davis and LeBron in the second half.
*  Doesn't take them out.
*  Davis gets hurt three nights later.
*  They could say, oh, that's a total coincidence.
*  Or you could say they were putting a shitload of miles on Anthony Davis, a guy who has
*  broken down over and over again in a variety of ways.
*  And he broke down three days after that game.
*  I remember this happened in New Orleans with Boogie cousins when they had the Boogie
*  Anthony Davis combo and they were just riding those guys and Boogie was playing big
*  minutes and then he got hurt.
*  And I just think you have to be really careful with these big, a little bit injury
*  prone guys.
*  So I already feel like they were pushing the RPMs to like seven.
*  Davis already broke down and LeBron is in year 20.
*  If like, if I was a consultant of the Lakers, I would be like, dude, the New Orleans
*  pick is a sunk cost.
*  OK, first of all, no one should hire you of all people as a consultant to the Lakers.
*  This is a great idea.
*  They should hire me.
*  A little totally honest with my thoughts.
*  If I was an objective consultant, I would be like, what are we doing?
*  Yeah, Pelicans pick is gone.
*  We're not getting it back.
*  We're not going to win the title with the team we have.
*  Now we're going to ruin the end of the 2020s for what?
*  We're going to be better than Milwaukee.
*  I think my counterpoint to that would be when was the last time that the Lakers
*  future was actually their draft picks in any way?
*  Like this is not a team that drafts players and goes through like the long
*  developmental process.
*  And like, those are our guys, not since Kobe effectively.
*  Like that was really like the standout case of that.
*  But like LeBron wanted to come here and it wasn't because the Lakers had draft
*  picks and AD wanted to be traded there and it cost draft picks to do it.
*  But like ultimately, the young talent is not going to stand in the way of things
*  like that. It's not going to stand in the way of other stars right now, even with
*  everything as they are with the Lakers wanting to play there, wanting to be a
*  part of that franchise.
*  Like those are those are the facts of life for that organization.
*  And picks mean different things to different teams.
*  I don't think they mean that much to the Lakers, frankly.
*  Well, you know who hopes you're right about eight other teams in the NBA?
*  They certainly do.
*  I hope Rob Mahoney is right in that they're going to be dumb enough to trade those picks.
*  And that's the thing, ultimately, like that's why you want to be the first mover,
*  is like you want those picks.
*  You like you want to be able to take advantage of the fact that that pick means
*  more to your franchise than it ever would to the Lakers, even if it's the number
*  one overall pick.
*  I just have serious questions about Davis being able to stay healthy for eight,
*  nine months a year.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, I know his agent was taught he was interviewed about it and was
*  saying, like, if you if you look at each injury, each one was a fluke.
*  He stepped on somebody's foot or whatever.
*  But I just think if you're if you're relying on him the way the Lakers relied on
*  him to get back in the race when they were like two and 10, when he went on that
*  run, he couldn't sustain it.
*  He got he got hurt.
*  He broke down.
*  Some guys just aren't durable.
*  Other guys are.
*  Giannis doesn't break down, you know, like Luca as weird as he is and his slow
*  motion.
*  And I wouldn't say he's in the greatest shape ever, but he's durable.
*  Like he plays big minutes and has a big usage rate.
*  He doesn't get hurt.
*  Absolutely.
*  Joker never gets hurt.
*  Joker just gained steam.
*  You might be an alien and Davis gets hurt over and over and over again.
*  And I don't at some point you got to look at him and be like, is this a fluke or
*  is this who the guy is?
