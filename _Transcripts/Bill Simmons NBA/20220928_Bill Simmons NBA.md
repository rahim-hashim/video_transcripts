# Could LeBron James Ever Team Up With Steph Curry? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvwZfit2C34)
*  We went from, he did not seemingly like Steph Curry and there was a real rivalry there.
*  He was very dismissive of the Warriors and I think felt like Steph was on his corner
*  a lot of ways as this was supposed to be my league. Oh, where'd this new hot young star come from?
*  They win the title in 15. He gets revenge in 16, but there was a lot of something.
*  And I remember going to that game in 2018, the legendary game Lebron played,
*  when it looked like he was going to fight Curry and there was like an anger with Lebron.
*  You were there. I hadn't seen that level of like a real fuck you with him toward Curry.
*  I was like, ah, these guys don't like each other. And I asked Curry about it that summer and
*  he didn't really deny it. He's like, hey, we both want the same thing.
*  You know, game one of the finals, he's the maddest I've ever seen him.
*  And then in the OT, the game slipping away and he like blocked you and he talked shit to you.
*  I thought you guys were going to fight it because I was sitting right under that basket. I was like,
*  holy shit, they're going to fight for like two seconds.
*  That's when I said NBA pettiness is at an all time high.
*  Both sides, we were just, it was never going to spill over to that. But it was an interesting
*  moment with all that had gone on in game one. You went right at him though.
*  I know I was, I was hot because I was trying to finish out of possession. I think it was less than
*  a minute left. I didn't see him coming over from the weak side. So I tried to do a little soft
*  scoop layup and he pinned it. But then he stared you down. He stared me down and he said something
*  to me. And I was like, that's what we're really on right now. Like we're about to win. And you're
*  worried about me blocking my shot and talking trash. And then the whole JR, or sorry, the whole
*  Tristan and Draymond thing happened. I went back up to him. I was like, yo, what's up? Like we,
*  is this really what we're about right now? Like he's like, you know, I got to do that and make
*  sure my teammates know I'm a mentor. And that's like, it's part of the, you know, his leadership
*  and that type of deal. I was like, I don't want to be the sacrificial lamb for your leadership.
*  Like, come on man, that's messed up. But it's all the back and forth and stuff. When you play a
*  team in the finals, literally four years in a row, there's a lot of, a lot of back and forth going.
*  I want more of it. But then in the last couple of years where you have LeBron starts taking
*  Curry when he's the all-star captain, last year was going kind of out of his way to praise Curry
*  and was doing tweets during the playoffs. Like, oh my God, this boy's red hot and stuff he never
*  did. And I was like, Hmm, wonder if he's greasing the skids just in case.
*  Well, then there was Draymond Green's wedding this summer where they all put that photo with the four
*  like, Hey, let's get the four title club together. Like, there's no way like that's LeBron like with
*  a, I mean, he would not have done, do you think he would have done that five years ago? Hell no.
*  Yeah. I do not think he does that. No. Um, now, so the reason I thought that he was sort of making
*  nice, nice with Curry a couple of years ago was because there was some, and if Joe Lakeup was on
*  this pod, he would laugh at me and go, what are you talking about? But there was some wonder
*  about whether Curry would take that last contract with Golden State. Now look, it ended up being
*  0.0 drama. The warriors offered the full boat, you know, but he had injury issues. The warriors
*  were looking at, you know, a $400 million payroll. Nobody was sure they were going to do it. Um,
*  but I thought that he was, you know, giving them the wink, wink, cause he was like, Hey, you know,
*  if you don't take that last contract, you can come down to the Lakers. Cause that's what happened
*  with Kyrie. Yeah. When Kyrie was headed towards free agency and it was clear he wasn't going to
*  stay in Boston, LeBron, all of a sudden, the two of them kind of mended that fence. Um,
*  and I think it was based on that, the concept of playing together, getting in LA. And then it,
*  look, it didn't work out, didn't happen, but, um, that's what I thought. But now that I've seen
*  LeBron, who is theoretically still competing with Steph for the West titles, I'm not,
*  that photo was, if I had shown LeBron that photo, you know, in 2018, like
*  he had thought he was like, Photoshopped, right? You know, Steph was in his way in a lot of ways.
*  Yeah. And you know, there's also the under armor Nike thing. You know, Steph was, you know,
*  you're saying take his corner. Like Steph was like, you know, the kids started wearing Steph
*  jerseys. Yeah. And there was like that brief moment where under armor was like a thing.
*  And it was bigger than that though. Cause Steph took the kids, which I think LeBron felt like he
*  had the kids and Kobe was basically passing the kids to him. And then all of a sudden Steph showed
*  up and you have kids showing up 90 minutes before the game watching Steph warm up, which,
*  by the way, that's the business aspect of it is why that, you know, if you're a warrior,
*  you get access to all those Silicon Valley dudes. Not that LeBron needs that. Like he could get that
*  anyway, but like, yeah, part of it's not a bad thing doing right. Part of what LeBron's doing is
*  post career stuff.
