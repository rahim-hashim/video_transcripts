# NBA Legacy Reassessments: What Current Players Can Still Flip Theirs? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA)
*  Ryan, what do you think's the legacy of this podcast? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, it depends on if we're winning or we're losing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=5.2s)]
*  What would the legacy of this episode ultimately be, if you had to guess? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=8.56s)]
*  Who's the best player on this podcast? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=12.56s)]
*  Can we both be the best player or does one of us have to win? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=14.32s)]
*  I mean, more people would probably call me a Robin, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=17.68s)]
*  but I'd say like I've also done it on my own. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=19.6s)]
*  You're like Jalen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=22.56s)]
*  It's like you're a 1A on this podcast and not everyone maybe appreciates that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I was on a Friday show with Termini and Eddie. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=30.56s)]
*  And I've never felt more like Kyrie in my life. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=34.0s)]
*  Eddie was trying to start shit with me because I gave him so much Phoenix Sun shit the last [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=41.84s)]
*  couple of years and the salts are up three nothing and it seems like they're going to sweep, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=46.4s)]
*  which we'll get to in a second. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  And Eddie's like, but does this mean Jalen's the best player? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=52.16s)]
*  Who's the best player? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=55.2s)]
*  Is this going to screw you guys up? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=56.16s)]
*  And I knew what he was doing, but I was also like, I can't believe these are narratives [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  that come like if the Celtics swept, that's one of the debates that's going to come out of this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  It's like, well, now what does this mean? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=67.12s)]
*  Is Jalen better than Jason? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=68.56s)]
*  And so you asked when we were texting about this, what was the first ever legacy reassessment? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=70.0s)]
*  So that's going to be the first topic of the pot. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  I thought that was a great idea by you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=76.64s)]
*  And I really put work in it, but what was your answer? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=78.72s)]
*  Did you, did you put some thought? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=80.8s)]
*  What do you think it was? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=82.0s)]
*  Yeah, I actually put a lot of thought into this today. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=83.6s)]
*  And then there has to be a better version to find archived articles. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=85.36s)]
*  There has to be some thing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=89.36s)]
*  SiVault dying was a huge loss for all of us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=91.6s)]
*  I really miss it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=96.16s)]
*  It just sucks now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=97.2s)]
*  The hardest video games online right now are reading an Si article or Bleacher Report. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=98.72s)]
*  We were just like, what the fuck is that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=103.92s)]
*  Like, who's that guy? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=105.52s)]
*  Is that a Labo? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=106.48s)]
*  The Yahoo ones, a lot of the stuff from the 2000s is gone too. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=107.76s)]
*  The ESPN page two stuff and a lot of the ESPN MBA stuff is impossible. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=110.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=115.44s)]
*  So to get back to the original point of asking the question is. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=116.88s)]
*  Like I love Winnhorst. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=122.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=123.84s)]
*  I love Winnhorst. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=124.48s)]
*  And I think Winnhorst, when I think about people that will say aggressive stuff about players, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=125.28s)]
*  the way he lit into Luca after game three, which was pretty aggressive, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=131.92s)]
*  But when you don't do it all the time and you have the credibility of Winnhorst, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=137.92s)]
*  it'll always make me go like, okay, whoa. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=142.4s)]
*  Like that was, and there's even things he said in his takedown of Luca [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  that I thought were totally accurate and fair, but it was, it was aggressive. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  It's earned venom because he doesn't play the card really ever. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  So when he does it, it catches your attention. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=158.56s)]
*  Like there's certain people on TV where I'll just think, well, you do this with everything. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=158.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=163.84s)]
*  This is Tuesday for you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=165.68s)]
*  You can't be an 11 on every single comment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  So with Winnhorst, like we said, if he's going to say it, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  I think it should be consumed with just, even if you disagree, disagreed a little bit. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=175.04s)]
*  But then I felt like it was kind of then turning into, well, you guys realize Luca is the only [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=179.84s)]
*  reason they even have a whiff at this thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=185.84s)]
*  It's the only reason they're here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=188.48s)]
*  Oklahoma City is a good team. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=189.44s)]
*  Minnesota is a good team. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=191.36s)]
*  And for him to take those teams out and be the only really dependable guy, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=193.04s)]
*  despite the defensive, you know, inabilities from him. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=197.36s)]
*  So then I was, I was thinking about it, was texting with you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=201.68s)]
*  I go, we've been on a run of this for a while. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Like what was its sake for Giannis? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=207.12s)]
*  What was its sake for Joker? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=208.56s)]
*  Like if Joker doesn't win the finals last year, I don't know if he wins the MVP this year. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=210.88s)]
*  And there's this carry over of like the constant assessment that we do [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=216.4s)]
*  with the players that I thought, okay, let me ask Bill, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=220.72s)]
*  cause you're so good at the historic stuff. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=223.84s)]
*  When did this change? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=225.92s)]
*  I think I have answers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=228.4s)]
*  But to go back to the Luca piece of this, I had the same reaction you did. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  Cause I agreed with 90% of what Winn-Horse said. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=235.36s)]
*  I thought that was just a terrible job by Luca to foul out and to kind of lose his [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  composure in a must-win game. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=244.56s)]
*  And there was that play when he fell into the stands when he thought he should get the call. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  And then he was just hand, and then he was just hand checking Pritchard until he got fouled, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=250.4s)]
*  until he gets fouled. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=255.12s)]
*  That was the fourth foul. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=255.84s)]
*  And Doc and I talked about that on Wednesday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=257.12s)]
*  And Doc said he was watching the game. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=259.04s)]
*  He was like, Luca's going to foul out of this game. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  He's so frustrated. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=262.16s)]
*  He's actually going to foul out now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, that's his fault, but I'm with you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  Like, you know, even you look at the Luca and the first half, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Luca's last five first halves dating back to game five, Minnesota, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=271.76000000000005s)]
*  25 points, 10 for 16, game five, Minnesota in this series, 17, seven and 14 shooting, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=276.48s)]
*  23, nine for 14, 17, seven for 16, 25 in game four, 10 for 18. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=284.24s)]
*  He's been pretty incredible for a lot of these Celtic games, even though I, yeah, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=290.32s)]
*  we talked about the defense has been bad. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=296.24s)]
*  Some of the composure stuff has been bad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=298.24s)]
*  But the reason this team fell down three, nothing you could see after he fouled out [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=300.64s)]
*  when it was just Kyrie and the roll guys. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=304.32s)]
*  And it was like, wow, where's the offense coming from? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=306.72s)]
*  If they just shut down Kyrie, who else is even going to create a shot? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=310.08s)]
*  So yeah, I get it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=313.52s)]
*  Luca's got to fix some stuff. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=314.56s)]
*  But I thought that two days of Luca bashing, it felt pretty harsh to me, not just the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=316.0s)]
*  wind horse piece, but just that became the narrative. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=321.52s)]
*  And as a Celtic fan, I got worried because I was like, man, Luca's taken so much shit. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=323.84s)]
*  I just feel like he's like, this is what great players do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  They're going to now he's going to raise this game and, you know, 25 points in game four. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=331.12s)]
*  He was the dominant guy on the floor. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=335.44s)]
*  So, but from a big picture legacy point. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=338.24s)]
*  So there's two ways this could go. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=341.84s)]
*  We could go pre-internet or we can go post-internet because I think there's an [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=345.28s)]
*  inflection point in the mid nineties where the internet's coming into play. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=349.12s)]
*  And now you're getting message boards, you're getting early blog posts, you're getting [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=353.28s)]
*  early ESPN and some other, some other places, but you're also getting 24 hour talk radio. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=356.56s)]
*  And you're getting the rise of ESPN PTI doesn't show up to the early 2000s, but you're still [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=363.36s)]
*  getting like local sports radio and just the infrastructure of sports 24 seven is starting [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=368.56s)]
*  to settle in, which means it's probably Carl Malone in 97 when he wins the MVP and then [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  sucks in the finals. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=381.68s)]
*  And then it becomes, well, Jordan took the lead back. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=383.68s)]
*  Well, what does this mean for Carl Malone? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=386.0s)]
*  Were we wrong all along? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=387.68s)]
*  And that was the first modern version of that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=388.8s)]
*  I remember that was the first year of my Boston sports guy column writing like a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=390.8s)]
*  piece killing Carl Malone. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=394.56s)]
*  And I'm sure whatever, if you were like Mike and the mad dog, if you were whatever the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=397.44s)]
*  EI Winer line was, I'm sure it was just a Carl Malone pile session. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=402.4s)]
*  So I feel like that's the first. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=407.36s)]
*  Does that sound right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=408.56s)]
*  It does. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=410.96s)]
*  I wrote it down because like I went all the way back to Jerry West and was trying to find [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=411.36s)]
*  like different articles about how he was talked about. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=415.12s)]
*  Cause I was thinking about Jerry West, obviously this week with him passing and just [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=418.48s)]
*  like his entire thing is incredible success wrapped in all of these failures. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=422.16s)]
*  I mean, just a tortured human being. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=429.04s)]
*  And awful luck, the worst luck of any basketball star, just some of the worst things that could [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=431.36s)]
*  have happened to a career. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=436.08s)]
*  To lose to the Celtics six times in the finals, three times there's game sevens. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=438.56s)]
*  Now the 69 one, the Celtics aren't even supposed to be there. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=443.92s)]
*  And you're just like all these things happening in the series. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  Like I just thought about Jerry West was like, imagine if Jerry West existed today, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=451.44s)]
*  like what we would do to him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  And I always flip side, how we would do the whole, none of this is his fault. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=458.0s)]
*  And you just blame will you blame Elgin Baylor, you would blame Frank Selby for missing the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=463.2s)]
*  jumper in the 1962 finals. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=468.08s)]
*  It'd be everybody else's fault. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=470.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=472.4s)]
*  There's, there's also that cause whatever happens with the winning and losing, like [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=472.88s)]
*  that's the whole point. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=476.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=477.36s)]
*  Why do we keep track of any of this stuff? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=477.68s)]
*  Why do we spend all these hours talking about these things? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=479.12s)]
*  Well, clearly the winning has to mean something, but I have, it is not something that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=481.36s)]
*  contradicts itself. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=486.32s)]
*  I have players that I think have not won for different circumstances. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=487.28s)]
*  And I think there are other players who have not won and it has everything to do with who [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=490.8s)]
*  they are as a player. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  And yet it's now baked down. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=495.36s)]
*  Like I think people will become really simple whenever this stuff happens. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=497.28s)]
*  It's like, oh, you won. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=501.2s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  You're all these things. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=502.4s)]
*  It's like, oh, you lost. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=503.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=504.24s)]
*  Then you're all these things. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=504.56s)]
*  And you can't actually be, you can't ever be any of those other things until we update [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=505.76s)]
*  this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=510.08s)]
*  And now we're just updating it constantly. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=510.32s)]
*  So if you go to Carl Malone, I just wanted to just touch on the Jerry West part of it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  And then I think there's a lot of our dads out there that would go, Wilt was incredible, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  but he was also a loser. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=522.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=524.72s)]
*  There was a lot of that stuff that I just couldn't fathom. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=525.6s)]
*  I didn't watch the games, but in the 69 finals, Wilt has, has three games where he [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=528.48s)]
*  scores four, eight and eight in that series. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=533.28s)]
*  He didn't play the last six minutes of game seven or the last five. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=536.16s)]
*  He had this injury and then his coach benched him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=539.68s)]
*  In game seven with five minutes left. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=543.04s)]
*  And Russell was so mad that Wilt didn't come back in that they had a falling out. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  He was like, how dare you rob me of my final game where we were supposed to go head to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=549.76s)]
*  head and you're sitting on the bench because you made your coach mad. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=554.56s)]
*  You're right. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=557.76s)]
*  Wilt's the first legacy guy because he wins in 67. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=558.64s)]
*  And they have one of the best years ever. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  And they're like 68 and 13. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  They roll through the playoffs. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  They beat Russell Celtics and it's like, Wilt has arrived. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=567.84s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=571.44s)]
*  He's finally figured it out. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=572.08s)]
*  And then the next year was that year. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=573.6s)]
*  He tried to lead the league in assists and was like so unselfish. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  It was like actually like a disaster. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  He was like passing up five foot jump hooks to try to kick it back out. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  And then all the loser stuff started again. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=585.6s)]
*  But then in 72 with West, they went 33 straight. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=587.5200000000001s)]
*  They win the title. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=590.96s)]
*  So he kind of shook it off. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=592.4000000000001s)]
*  I just think there's a bunch of New England people walking around around our age that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  are nodding their heads specific to the New England thing because of the Celtics where [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=600.32s)]
*  there's just a lot of guys going, yeah, I had that same speech. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=605.44s)]
*  My dad gave me the same speech that Wilt was a loser. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=608.24s)]
*  I think history has actually been really kind to him in that with more information, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  maybe the impact of that information gets lost. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=618.0s)]
*  But as a kid, you were like, what did he do? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=620.16s)]
*  Like, wait, he was like this mythological creature. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=622.88s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=625.8399999999999s)]
*  How did he? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=627.6s)]
*  Well, how did he score that many? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=628.88s)]
*  Like what happened? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=630.16s)]
*  And then if especially if you're from New England, the dads would say he was awesome, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  but Russell owned him. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=635.76s)]
*  Well, but that was one of my, I think that was my single favorite chapter when I wrote [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=638.24s)]
*  my book about Wilt versus Russell, all the stuff digging up the anecdotes from that era [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=642.16s)]
*  where like some of the best players of that era were like, Wilt was a loser. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=646.96s)]
*  I want to play with Wilt. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=651.52s)]
*  Wilt didn't want the ball in crunch time because they were way more candid back then. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  We didn't know there was an internet and a screenshot Twitter. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=657.44s)]
*  I'll tell you the first modern version of this that even though it was way pre-internet, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  but it was Dr. J because Dr. J wins the titles in the ABA. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=666.64s)]
*  He comes to Philly. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=671.52s)]
*  They're up two nothing in the 77 finals. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=673.12s)]
*  Then Walton comes back and they beat him. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=675.36s)]
*  And then they don't make the finals in 78 or 79. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=677.6s)]
*  They make it in 80. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  Magic beats them. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=681.76s)]
*  They lose in 81. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=683.28s)]
*  They make the finals in 82. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  They beat the Celtics in a game seven in Boston. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=686.88s)]
*  The Lakers freaking wax them. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=689.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=691.2s)]
*  And at that point it was like, well, Dr. J, I mean, he won those in the ABA, but not here. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=692.0s)]
*  And you could go back and read the Sports Illustrated articles. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=696.72s)]
*  There was a few of them that I remember leaning on when I was doing my book. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=699.6s)]
*  And just the disappointment that Dr. J wasn't more impactful and better, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=704.32s)]
*  especially in the late seventies. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  It was like, was it where we sold a false bill of goods? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  He was awesome in his first season in 77, a bunch of highlights. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=713.84s)]
*  His knees were bothering him, but then he won the title in 83 and it stopped. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=717.2s)]
*  And then it just flipped to Magic because Magic had the 84 finals [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=720.88s)]
*  when he sucked in game two, he sucked in game four, he choked in a bunch of different ways. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=725.2s)]
*  And he, and that was the tragic Johnson thing, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=729.84s)]
*  which has been written and talked about a million times. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=732.32s)]
*  And then of course he shed that and in 85 they win. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=735.28s)]
*  So it feels like Doc Magic right around there, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=738.32s)]
*  but the current infrastructure starts with Karl Malone and then Shaq in 2000. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=742.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=747.84s)]
*  It's like Shaq, same thing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=748.08s)]
*  Shaq's a loser. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=749.12s)]
*  Shaq's the new world. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=750.16s)]
*  Shaq's never going to win. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=751.52s)]
*  And then he rips through everybody, wins the 2000 title. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=752.96s)]
*  It's like, all right, enough with that narrative. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=755.28s)]
*  And then Kobe in 2009 was the other one from that decade. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=756.8s)]
*  It's like Kobe can never win without Shaq. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=760.56s)]
*  He's selfish. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=762.16s)]
*  It's all about him. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=763.52s)]
*  It's one-on-one basketball. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=765.52s)]
*  Can't win that way. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  It's a bad teammate. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=767.92s)]
*  And then guess what? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=769.68s)]
*  He won the title. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  There goes that narrative. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't remember the seventies, obviously the eighties part of it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=774.0s)]
*  The Dr. J one is good, but I only understood it after the fact. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=777.52s)]
*  And they get Moses. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  That's one of the greatest teams of my lifetime. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=782.56s)]
*  That's just lost in the shadow of all the Celtics Lakers stuff. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=784.88s)]
*  But I also think the Celtics and Lakers were so dominant. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=788.8s)]
*  And I think this plays into the nineties a little bit where. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=791.28s)]
*  I wasn't freaked out about Terry Cummings legacy. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=795.76s)]
*  I wasn't sitting around going, man, this Alex English, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, what the hell's wrong with Adrian Dantley? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=802.0s)]
*  I just, I didn't care. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  And maybe that happened with Houston a little bit [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=806.64s)]
*  because of the twin towers, the 86 finals, taking out the Lakers, losing to the Celtics. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  And then it took Akim almost another decade, but you were always losing. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=813.28s)]
*  For the most part, you were losing to Lakers and Celtics. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=818.8s)]
*  And I think from a player standpoint, that's where, when I looked back [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=820.88s)]
*  and read some of the stuff with Barkley in 93, like that one was devastating to me [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=824.16s)]
*  just because I was a huge Barkley fan, but you were losing to Jordan. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=828.4s)]
*  Like, I don't remember. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=832.16s)]
*  And Barkley was awesome in that series. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=833.12s)]
*  That was everyone blamed Kevin Johnson because he sucked so bad in that finals. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=834.9599999999999s)]
*  That it just, all the venom went toward him. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=838.88s)]
*  Barkley was really good in that finals. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=841.28s)]
*  I thought. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=843.68s)]
*  But we did because Jordan was scoring so much. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=844.64s)]
*  I mean, people, it's very easy to forget this, but that was like the first thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=847.4399999999999s)]
*  And I also think regionally, the Celtics thing probably messes up my perspective [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=851.36s)]
*  just growing up around it, but it was like, oh yeah, this guy's cool, cool dunks, cool sneakers. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=854.96s)]
*  He's a loser though. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=861.28s)]
*  All he does is score a million points and he can't win. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=862.16s)]
*  And it took him a really long time when you look at his career. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=865.04s)]
*  But then when everybody else is losing to him, I don't remember that after the 96 finals being [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=868.48s)]
*  like, oh, Kemp and Gary Payton are losers. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=873.2s)]
*  Like I just, I just don't remember any of that stuff. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=875.92s)]
*  So I think the Karl Malone part of it because of the MVPs, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=878.64s)]
*  that might've been the beginning of, I like the way you framed that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=882.4s)]
*  Like of today's structure, that was maybe the foundation for it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=885.6s)]
*  Cause it definitely got worse. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=888.48s)]
*  Cause the Shaq stuff was real because when he had the quote where he said, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=889.52s)]
*  I'd won at every level except for college and the pros people were so like, are you, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=892.4s)]
*  imagine somebody saying that. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=896.96s)]
*  We need the free throws too. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=898.0s)]
*  Remember that was like, well, he doesn't care about free throws. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=899.76s)]
*  Obviously it doesn't care about winning. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=902.48s)]
*  Can't make free throws. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=904.4s)]
*  There's another one. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=906.4s)]
*  Cause I was thinking about some of the pieces I wrote and LeBron became the first [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=907.12s)]
*  entire career legacy guy, right? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=911.68s)]
*  When he, when he got drafted out of high school and was being hyped up and there was a backlash [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=913.8399999999999s)]
*  that we hadn't even seen him play. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=919.76s)]
*  And then somehow during his rookie year, as we watched them like, oh, this guy might have it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=921.12s)]
*  And then it just became a constant debate about how good he was. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  Then we were disappointed. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  Danny beats, makes the 2007 finals beats the Pistons in that game. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=932.4s)]
*  Five was like, here we go. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  LeBron's arrived. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=937.04s)]
*  Then he had the two disappointing Oh nine, 10 playoffs in Cleveland. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=938.24s)]
*  Oh nine wasn't his fault. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=942.16s)]
*  10 was. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=943.28s)]
*  And then the 2011 finals. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=944.4s)]
*  And I was thinking the 2011 finals were the first double team legacy one, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=946.4s)]
*  like the way you were laying it out. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=951.28s)]
*  Cause we had on the one hand LeBron. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=953.04s)]
*  Oh man, he doesn't have it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=955.68s)]
*  Oh, this big three, this whole situation. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=957.68s)]
*  This is now going to be a legendary disaster potentially. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=960.08s)]
*  But then Dirk on the flip side, who we had kind of given up on after the Oh six finals. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=963.44s)]
*  And then the way he wins the Oh seven MVP and Golden state beats them in round one. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  It was just so embarrassing for him. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  And then he kind of moves into this 25 a game. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=975.36s)]
*  Don't take them seriously as a champ. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  All-star kind of good stats that ultimately kind of, kind of hollow. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  And then an 11 has one of the great runs in the history of the playoffs and just checks off, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=987.1199999999999s)]
*  checks off to rant, checks off Kobe, checks off LeBron and Wade in the finals after they [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=991.92s)]
*  talk shit and the finals ends and it became a John Owey Broncos thing. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  So we were talking about that legacy, but then there was also the LeBron legacy. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  So I feel like that's like officially cemented because now we have [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1004.88s)]
*  first take starting right around then. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  I think first take exists, PTI exists. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1010.8s)]
*  All the internet stuff is in full form. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1013.52s)]
*  All the Reddit stuff is in full form and now we're off. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1016.56s)]
*  And now that now it's legacy time. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1019.52s)]
*  Dirk got destroyed during that stretch. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1022.0s)]
*  So they blow the lead in Oh six and then he wins MVP. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  The Mavs come back stronger. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1030.96s)]
*  We think 67 and 15. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1032.8s)]
*  And then they lose the Warriors as a one eight seed and he was getting torched. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1035.6799999999998s)]
*  And he got the MVP. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1041.04s)]
*  After he had been eliminated. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1044.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1046.08s)]
*  So it was all of these things. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1046.56s)]
*  The most awkward. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1048.0s)]
*  It was something where you're like, when did it really get nasty? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1050.3999999999999s)]
*  Plenty of these guys, as we've just alluded to going over this history, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1056.32s)]
*  have gotten destroyed by the media, but the dark one was a special case because then you [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  could throw in it's like, Oh, he's just kind of one of those big soft euros. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1067.12s)]
*  Soft foreign guy. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1070.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1071.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  On top of everything else. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1072.08s)]
*  And people were really like pissed at them almost. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1073.44s)]
*  Not because he had the thing. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1078.16s)]
*  What was that? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1079.92s)]
*  Oh, two or three playoffs. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1080.4s)]
*  One of those two, we got hurt and they shelved them and he could have played, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1081.68s)]
*  but they didn't want to risk his career. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1085.2s)]
*  I think it was Oh three. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1087.76s)]
*  And then Cuban and it was a whole debate and he could have played. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1090.16s)]
*  And so it kind of started there. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1093.36s)]
*  And then in Oh six, when they blew the lead and then Oh seven by the, by the time Oh seven [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1094.64s)]
*  was done, people like Dirk soft can't win with Dirk. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1099.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, the guy, what he did in 2011 was about as impressive. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1102.2399999999998s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  This would be a fun list guys who took too much shit. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1107.28s)]
*  And then the alternate side of guys who maybe in retrospect didn't get enough shit. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, I'm not sure Carmelo got enough shit. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1115.04s)]
*  For Carlos to be number one. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1118.08s)]
*  Cause I think now, now that there's this instance and Carmelo is a good guy, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1121.1999999999998s)]
*  everybody likes him. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  He had a really good career as a hall of Famer. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  But if you go back, it's like, ah, it's kind of disappointing too. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1127.6000000000001s)]
*  Like they were two, two Denver Lakers, 2009, right? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1130.4s)]
*  It's the best two out of three against Kobe who had had his knee drained earlier in that series. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1134.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's like, that was a moment for Carmelo potentially to you win two out of three [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1138.8000000000002s)]
*  against the Lakers. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1143.44s)]
*  You win the title because you're playing Orlando and that's the closest he ever got. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1144.0800000000002s)]
*  And you know, then the way he forced the trade to the next, like that's, that's a good example [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1148.24s)]
*  of somebody that I think the post-career stuff is a little friendlier than maybe it could have been. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1154.24s)]
*  Melo's a really good one. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1160.56s)]
*  I used to defend Melo though. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1161.6s)]
*  If you go through all of the playoffs series losses, you go, all right, well, how many times [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1162.96s)]
*  was he losing to a team that he shouldn't lose to? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1168.96s)]
*  Like, I think that's like the telltale sign for a lot of these players that are all NBA caliber guys, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1171.28s)]
*  guys in the MVP conversations, the clear ones of some of these teams where there's just ones [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1176.24s)]
*  where I go, I know you're, you're thought of as a one and you're a one, however we define it, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1181.76s)]
*  but it's not a winning one. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1186.24s)]
*  And I think Melo probably had some of those basketball traits, but when you go back and look [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1188.4s)]
*  at all the playoff losses that he had, rarely are you looking at teams where you'd say, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1191.6s)]
*  how did he lose to that team? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1197.36s)]
*  Like the, the team was either always better than him or they were within a few games having [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  the same record when they actually matched up in the playoffs. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1203.04s)]
*  But Melo's a good one in there, but I like how you, you kind of referenced the full circle [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1205.2s)]
*  thing with Dirk because it wasn't just even about winning after you lost. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1209.52s)]
*  It was winning against what became everyone's least favorite team outside of Heat fans. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1214.08s)]
*  There was no neutrality with the Miami Heat, especially in that first year. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1219.04s)]
*  I had friends that were pretty passive NBA fans that were like, I want nothing to do with that [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1222.72s)]
*  league. They were just personally offended by LeBron going down there with Bosch, which again, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1228.4s)]
*  those guys got way too much shit historically. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1234.32s)]
*  I would say when you look back on it, I think there's probably a lot of people. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1237.04s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  I was way too mad about that. That wasn't that big of a deal was the fact that Dirk does it, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1240.72s)]
*  right? Mr. Euro, Mr. Soft, cool stats, bro, lose to the Warriors, which were such a fun team too. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1245.76s)]
*  So like anybody that had been neutral with that series is going, oh my God, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1251.76s)]
*  this Warriors team's awesome. This is so much fun. Like I want them to beat the Mavs. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1255.12s)]
*  And the Mavs are really getting just torched in that two-year window. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1259.2s)]
*  And of course a big part of it was Dirk. And I think it always kind of acts like a question. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1262.8s)]
*  I don't know that can be answered is how different was Dirk? Like how different was he actually [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1266.0s)]
*  in 07 and 2011? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1271.04s)]
*  I think the scars from 06 and 07 actually helped him because he's talked about it since. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1273.6s)]
*  Like sometimes when you get your teeth kicked in, it makes you a little, I feel the same way about [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1279.12s)]
*  this 24 Celtics team. Like some of the stuff that happened to them over the last eight years, I think [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1285.12s)]
*  becomes helpful when you hit that mental toughness point, like what they had in game three, where [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1290.0s)]
*  they're blowing this lead in real time. It feels like this huge collapse coming and they kind of [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1294.64s)]
*  gathered their breath a little bit. I don't know if they would have been able to do that two years [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1300.48s)]
*  ago. I mentioned Carmelo. It's funny. I was always a big Carmelo defender when he played. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1303.3600000000001s)]
*  I was looking up as you were talking, I wrote a column in July, 2014. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1308.3200000000002s)]
*  And the headline was no escape from New York with Carmelo Anthony staying with the Knicks. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1312.48s)]
*  Will we ever find out how truly great he can be? Because my whole thing was like, I think Carmelo [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1316.96s)]
*  can be the best guy on a championship team. And he never really had the right situation. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1321.2s)]
*  The other guy who I thought was remembered a little unfairly, and I wrote about him too, is T-Mac. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1325.76s)]
*  Because I thought I had T-Mac in like my top 75. I thought he was great, but it was the same thing [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  where it was like, well, he blew a 3-1 lead in round one and he never got out of this and he's [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1336.48s)]
*  never played in the finals. And then you just kind of get pigeonholed in that spot. And you're right. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1342.0s)]
*  Like the key point is circumstances can sometimes play a lot of this. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1346.24s)]
*  I know T-Mac. Of course it does. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1351.6799999999998s)]
*  T-Mac in the middle of 2000s was right there with Wade and Kobe and he just was. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1353.6799999999998s)]
*  To me, like those three are pretty even for about five, six years there. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1359.04s)]
*  But I don't think we're ever looking at T-Mac as a loser because one, his style of play was so much [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1364.24s)]
*  fun. And we didn't look at him as this absurd, even though their usage rates, I'm sure are really [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1370.24s)]
*  high in some of those seasons, but we knew he was more of a playmaker. It didn't feel like he was [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1376.56s)]
*  just going to do whatever he wanted to do whenever he felt like it and wasn't really looking at the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1381.52s)]
*  game through the lens of somebody just being like, how do I make everybody better around me? So I [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1385.84s)]
*  think there's just a lot of stuff with T-Mac aesthetically that we all loved. Like even if [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1391.28s)]
*  you weren't a player in the magical. Yeah. So I think there's more sympathy for him, but I, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1395.28s)]
*  look, my guy, Chris Paul, it's not going to happen. Right? It's not going to happen with him. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1401.92s)]
*  Don't rule it out. If the Warriors wave them before July 28th, there could be a little grab on, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1408.32s)]
*  grab on to a contender. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1414.8s)]
*  There's a certain stage where past a certain number of years and who you are as a player, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1417.92s)]
*  I actually thought he was pretty good for the Warriors, but he's not going to be [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1422.0s)]
*  playing the same kind of role he was playing with the 21 Phoenix sons or potentially the 22 [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1425.76s)]
*  Phoenix sons. Like that probably isn't happening again. So when I think back to what is 40, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1430.64s)]
*  Barkley, yeah, right. Barkley gets shit on because he's still on TNT. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1436.88s)]
*  But I don't know. Right. But then when Jordan said that to Pippen about, I should have never [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1442.64s)]
*  gone to Houston and played with your sorry ass because you were a loser. You know, I'm paraphrasing, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1448.48s)]
*  but Pippen sharing that, that Jordan thought that of Barkley, but the nineties really felt like it [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1452.64s)]
*  was more of, well, they lost to Jordan. So what are you supposed to do with that? I don't, I don't [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1458.4s)]
*  think we got on these guys' cases as much as we do now or how willing we are to just rewrite all of [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1464.64s)]
*  it based on the outcome of some series when the player might not be any different. So we might [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1470.32s)]
*  have a new wave of like when these guys age out, when Westbrook, when Harden are done, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1475.12s)]
*  that might be the group of guys where there's just not really going to be any kind of sympathy [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1481.84s)]
*  whatsoever, despite the accolades in the Hall of Fame resumes. So I don't, I wonder if we're [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1486.08s)]
*  actually starting to graduate the first generation of this group of players of the last 20 years, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1492.8s)]
*  where when they're retired- I would say it's a 2.0 generation. I think the Dirk Kobe generation [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1499.36s)]
*  was the first generation. I think this is, I think you're right that this, this Harden, Westbrook, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1503.52s)]
*  Durant, all these guys, this is definitely a generation, but I think it's like the, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1509.44s)]
*  kind of the second generation. That really does feel like Dirk Kobe, that era was in there. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1513.92s)]
*  All right. So Rossello, you texted me and you asked which guys can flip their legacy [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1520.0s)]
*  next couple of years, AKA Kyrie, because I do think win or lose with this finals, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1525.36s)]
*  Kyrie has at least reestablished himself as a wiser, better version of himself that I don't think [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1533.52s)]
*  he's as good as he was in 16 or 17, but is somebody that can be one of the best players [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1541.12s)]
*  on a team that can play in the finals because we're watching it. And that's something I think you [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1545.68s)]
*  and I would have thought a year ago was inconceivable. So if you had to make a list of who's the next Kyrie, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1549.68s)]
*  who's the next person for this to have this happen to, who would be your number one pick? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  Probably Bryson DeChambeau. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1560.96s)]
*  Right, as we're taping this, he's winning US Open. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1565.92s)]
*  And the crowd's rooting for him. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1568.3200000000002s)]
*  But this is exactly what's going to happen. If he wins a major this whole week in the golf world, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1570.3200000000002s)]
*  they'd be like, ah, he wasn't that annoying. It wasn't really that bad. He was misunderstood. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1575.68s)]
*  People couldn't stand him. People couldn't stand him for years. And they're going to all tell us [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1583.44s)]
*  why it was actually just kind of like misleading. And that's not really who he was. And his approach [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1588.16s)]
*  was he was trying to hack golf. And he learned from that. He has the scars. I believe in all [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  the scar stuff. The next Kyrie, the Kyrie one, as I'm sure you would concede. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1599.28s)]
*  It's pretty unique. Yeah, we're not going to have another Kyrie situation. It's unique. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1606.24s)]
*  Does it matter for Durant? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1613.44s)]
*  I had him down. I had six guys down. He wasn't my first choice. I thought I had Dame as the number one. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1614.72s)]
*  Dame's a great one. Because I don't want to just name. I just don't want to name like all the good [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1627.52s)]
*  players who don't have rings. No, it feels like there has to be more to it. Yeah. So Doc was on my [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1632.56s)]
*  pod on Wednesday saying how Dame was out of shape this year. I was actually surprised he mentioned [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1638.32s)]
*  to it. Said he was a little out of shape because he knew he was going to get traded and he was so [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1642.8s)]
*  afraid to work out that it ended up fucking up his whole season. So if you're thinking about this next [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1646.8799999999999s)]
*  season with the Bucs, where Jan, as I'm sure is going to be a man on a mission because he just has [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1652.32s)]
*  had bad luck with injuries now two years in a row. Dame in like the greatest shape of his life. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1658.56s)]
*  Dame not playing the Olympics, which is good. And then, you know, if you're just talking about [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1664.0s)]
*  I had the Tiger, the Bucs have to be number one in the Eastern Conference if the Celtics actually [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1669.04s)]
*  win the title. Like who, who is going to actually care the most about this season for a variety of [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1673.36s)]
*  reasons. And then if Dame can reestablish himself as this awesome offensive player again, which I [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1678.8s)]
*  think he was pretty up and down, I think we would both agree. And then be kind of the Kyrie sidekick [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  with, with Janis as the Luca, you know, then that's, it's a different territory. You know, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1692.24s)]
*  it could also go the other way where it, that doesn't happen. And you end up in that Carmelo [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1697.76s)]
*  mid 2010s run where it's like, Oh, I guess this isn't going to happen. And then all of a sudden [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1704.0s)]
*  you start bouncing around the league. So I do feel like there's a fork in the road potential with him. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1710.16s)]
*  I like that one a lot. I really liked how Doc talked about Janis' playmaking, which I completely [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1716.24s)]
*  agree with. And I think that's why Janis gives you a chance in a way where maybe somebody else [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1721.12s)]
*  is putting up huge numbers. You'd be like, okay, but is he willing to get the other people involved? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1727.04s)]
*  And I couldn't quite figure out, like it felt like Janis was kind of leading the charge [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1731.36s)]
*  for them to get Adrian Griffin. And then it was the other guys that were anti-Adrien Griffin. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1737.28s)]
*  And then finally, like Janis kind of came along and I was wondering, this is a different topic, but [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1742.8s)]
*  is Janis' ring the most important ring for an individual player of the last five years? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1750.0s)]
*  The most important legacy ring? Yeah. Yeah. You know what? I actually think it's Curry in 2022. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1756.88s)]
*  I think as the years pass, let's say they don't win in 2022. They just, let's say they lose [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1766.24s)]
*  to Memphis in round two and it's just, they never get back. And then Curry gets in this [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1773.04s)]
*  weird situation where he's one of the most influential players of all time. He's the [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1779.1200000000001s)]
*  greatest shooter of all time, but he also becomes a little bit of a yeah, but guy. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1782.32s)]
*  Where it's like 2015 finals, couldn't win the MVP. 16, couldn't get done. 17, 18, needed KD. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1787.04s)]
*  Yeah, but. And then the 22 just took it off the table. And that was that. Now he's one of the [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1795.04s)]
*  best 12 players of all time. Janis, I still feel like can get, like, I don't know if that was his [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1799.9199999999998s)]
*  last chance, I guess is my point. For Curry it was. Yeah, it's definitely not Janis' last chance. I [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1805.76s)]
*  mean, I voted Janis. He could go to the next. Like there's yeah, he could go to. Who knows? Who [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1811.44s)]
*  knows where he's playing three years from now, but I guarantee he's going to be impactful. I just [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1817.52s)]
*  feel like there's more swings at the pinata for him. Sometimes Janis, I feel like he's actually [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1821.04s)]
*  like underrated, which I know probably sounds stupid, but yeah, I think you're. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1825.52s)]
*  It's a bit like another one. Yeah, but I want to lay out the Durant case. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1832.72s)]
*  If it's. So Brooklyn with Kyrie disaster extension fire everybody. OK, never mind. No, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1837.84s)]
*  actually trade me, but only trade me to this team and Phoenix doesn't make it. And I'm not even [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1845.4399999999998s)]
*  talking about a ring bill. I'm talking about like just a competitive Western Conference finals where [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1849.76s)]
*  we're not sure the outcome. And even if the Suns were to lose just a hell of a lot better than what [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1853.84s)]
*  we saw with Minnesota just taking him out back. Yeah, it's a woodshed that I don't know that [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1857.9199999999998s)]
*  you're ever going to see somebody as great as Durant have two rings where you want to use a [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  yeah, but example. He's going to be out of the all the guys in the top 20 with rings. He'll be the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1868.4799999999998s)]
*  biggest. Yeah, but he will. I don't know. So as you know, I'm probably his biggest fan. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1874.8799999999999s)]
*  It will be yeah, but you joined a 73 win team and you won two titles and that's the only reason you [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1884.9599999999998s)]
*  won. That's what he's going to get and he's going to say he doesn't care, but I think he does. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1889.52s)]
*  I have another like this is a great one. It's a zag. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1898.0s)]
*  Jah. It's young. You don't think of it, right? It's like. But there's [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1904.4s)]
*  Jah. It's just a lot of I kind of forgot about Jah. Everyone's forgotten about Jah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1912.16s)]
*  They're just kind of over here on the side, but if you look at their summer and their roster and [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1917.12s)]
*  their pieces combined with the fact that they have the ninth pick and hopefully he comes back with [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1922.8s)]
*  his head on straight, I don't know. They're left out of that Western conversation. I don't know if [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1928.8s)]
*  I would leave them out because there's no reason he can't at least imitate Edwards from an offensive [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1935.12s)]
*  statistic standpoint. He's not going to imitate the defense part, but could he match? Could he be [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1941.44s)]
*  basically Edwards from Memphis? Yeah, I think it could. So and this is somebody that I think we're [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1946.96s)]
*  all disappointed in and worried that it's going to keep going sideways and maybe it just flips and [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1953.6000000000001s)]
*  goes the other way. That's a great one. Thank you. I don't even feel like you had to get the zag. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1959.52s)]
*  Well, because he's young. You don't think of it like legacy young guys yet, but you know, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1966.64s)]
*  he's headed toward like you start rattling off the disappointing superstars who their career got [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1972.24s)]
*  fucked up in some way, and he's in pencil on that list unless he flips it. He gives you so much fun. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1978.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And in the beginning and then you think about the record they had before everybody got hurt [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1986.5600000000002s)]
*  a couple years ago and you're going, man, and they like that's what the what the timber wolves [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1991.68s)]
*  just did is what this Memphis story was supposed to be. This playoff moment where they announced [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=1997.2800000000002s)]
*  to the NBA world, OK, like we're a real factor here. You got to always be thinking about Memphis [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2002.88s)]
*  and how you match up with us. And then, of course, just when it gets into like the favorite, the guys [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2008.48s)]
*  that you just love watching play basketball. Although I'll tell you, I'm going to worry about [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2013.2800000000002s)]
*  him the rest of his career the way he lands. Well, yeah, we've been talking about that for [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2017.92s)]
*  what, four years? Yeah, he's our number one oh no guy other than Porzingis. Yeah. But then you add [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2023.6000000000001s)]
*  in the other part here. Just think. This guy's deal is what's still the longest time. So he doesn't [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2030.0800000000002s)]
*  feel like the face of franchise in the last couple of seasons. It's up to him to kind of turn that [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2040.16s)]
*  around. But that's a good one. Do you have one? Because I have another one. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2045.92s)]
*  Well, I just have the aged out group that we've already talked about. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2052.56s)]
*  All right. I have two more. I think we covered it. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2057.2000000000003s)]
*  Is Levine good enough for the conversation? No. OK. How about Paul George? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2062.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course he is. So I really like Paul George and he was actually my number one guy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2069.6s)]
*  And my list after Dame because he's had a fascinating career dating back to going toe to [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2075.68s)]
*  toe with Miami and those two Indiana heat finals, which seemed like a million years ago, but they're [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2083.2s)]
*  only 11 and 12 years ago. It's the broken leg comes back from that is a huge, huge, huge trade [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2088.0s)]
*  piece slash can we get this guy piece for a couple of years, which we're about to talk about the [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2095.12s)]
*  retreatables has that weird OKC year. And then instead of going Lakers goes to the Clippers [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2099.84s)]
*  and becomes kind of Kawhi's Jalen Brown. But then when Kawhi got hurt that one year, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2106.96s)]
*  what was that? 22. And all of a sudden, Paul George looked like he could be a one A and be [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2113.6800000000003s)]
*  the best guy on a finals team potentially and almost got it done. And now he's kind of floated [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2118.2400000000002s)]
*  into that zone. What did you call him? A coin toss guy? Yeah, I called he and Harden the coin [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2124.56s)]
*  toss brothers in the playoffs. It's a man, a man, one of your best nicknames of all time, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2130.64s)]
*  the coin toss brothers. So the question for me is this Paul George, I think is hiding into his, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2135.04s)]
*  it would be his 15th season. This next one where he's going to get one last big contract. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2140.08s)]
*  And is that just who he is? Is he a coin toss brother or what if he went to Philadelphia [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2145.2799999999997s)]
*  and played with Embita Maxey or what if he went into Orlando and became the lead guy with Palo or [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2150.5600000000004s)]
*  you know, wherever. What if the Lakers and Clippers flip him and he becomes a Laker and [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2156.88s)]
*  LeBron goes to the Clippers? Like whatever scenario you want to give. It seems like he's going to be [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2161.44s)]
*  in a more interesting spot next year than this year, I guess is my point, because whatever he's [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2166.8s)]
*  wherever he is on the Clippers, he's the number three star on the movie poster now because Kawhi [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2170.7200000000003s)]
*  sucks up all the oxygen and then Harden once he got there, he sucked up a lot of the oxygen [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2176.0s)]
*  and it's like, oh yeah. And we also have Paul George and he, I think he's better than that. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2180.8s)]
*  I voted for him for all NBA last year too, I should mention. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2187.76s)]
*  I was looking at this because I know we're going to talk Sixers and options and all that stuff, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2192.48s)]
*  but I'm glad you brought up the 22 playoff run because prior to that- [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2196.8s)]
*  He was like 30 a game, right? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2205.44s)]
*  Yeah, excuse me. The 21 playoff run. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2208.0s)]
*  21, that's what it was because it was still a little COVID hangover. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2210.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. I thought that series against Utah, a really good regular season team in Utah, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2213.84s)]
*  I just thought it was important that Dallas series, that Utah series, and then he still put up big [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2220.88s)]
*  numbers against the Suns, which ended up going six games. And he used to be somebody that was [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2226.64s)]
*  almost laughably underperforming in the playoffs. Which made the playoff P nickname so funny. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2236.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there was the game, I forget, was it a playoff game against Cleveland where [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2244.72s)]
*  he either they were in the Gatorade commercial where he hits this game winner in the Gatorade [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2250.56s)]
*  commercial, then he came back in the real game out of commercial and missed it, or it was the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2255.44s)]
*  other way around. And then when you look at the Oklahoma City losses in the two years that he was [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2259.84s)]
*  there at 18 and 19, the game that I just was like, how do you score 34 points in game five and five [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  points in game six? How did the Thunder lose to the Jazz that year? That series means a lot to me [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2274.32s)]
*  when I think about Westbrook. And then at that time with George, so I think the 21 one that George [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2282.64s)]
*  was on was really important, at least for him. And that's kind of the, maybe we're too deep in the [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2289.2799999999997s)]
*  weeds with it, but I think that's why the playoffs can be so important too, beyond just who wins the [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2294.4s)]
*  whole thing or who loses in the finals and who's an all-time great and then who sucks and who's [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2297.92s)]
*  disappointing is going to be labeled all these things the rest of their lives. But for George, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2302.0s)]
*  just to have that moment, because at that point, the standard had been so low set by him of like, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2306.16s)]
*  what is this guy? And after Dame hits that shot, and he's like, it's still a bad shot. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  And you're just not allowed to say it, even if it was right. You just say, what the hell are you [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2316.08s)]
*  thinking about when you're out there when you're in this incredibly talented guy? So I don't know [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2320.48s)]
*  if the ring part of it mentions, but I'd say the second part of his playoff thing here has been [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2326.3999999999996s)]
*  just far better than, maybe I should say the third part, because I think the early indie [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2332.08s)]
*  chapters were actually pretty good for him when no one really expected that team to beat the Heat [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2337.04s)]
*  anyway. So Kawhi gets hurt in game four of that Utah series and including game four all the way [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2341.68s)]
*  through the Phoenix series, Paul George in those nine games was 30, 11 rebounds, 5.4 assists, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2348.0s)]
*  playing 41 minutes a game. I mean, that was, he looked like one of the five, six best guys in the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2357.44s)]
*  league. So the question, like I think about the Philly fit for him, which I'm not sure I'm buying [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2361.84s)]
*  it. As I talked about in previous pods, I just don't, I don't buy that a guy who grew up in [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2367.1200000000003s)]
*  California who wanted for years to get back to California, who's in California is something [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2372.08s)]
*  that could be like, you know, it sounds awesome Philly for great things about their fans in the [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2376.32s)]
*  East coast. Maybe I'll try it. I just, I'm dubious, but I asked the thing from a basketball standpoint, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2381.1200000000003s)]
*  it would be an amazing move to play with Maxine and Embiid. Now you're in the same situation [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2386.56s)]
*  and beat as you are with Kawhi where you just have your fingers crossed every week that the guy's [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2391.36s)]
*  going to be in the court, but they need somebody like him. And in the East, which I think is wide [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2395.28s)]
*  open with the exception of Boston and whatever we see from Milwaukee, like it's possible. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  One more legacy guy really quick. Um, there's a LeBron ring chase piece that I don't think he'll [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2408.08s)]
*  do, but it would be interesting if he did it. Cause he's still good enough that it wouldn't [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2416.96s)]
*  feel like a Gary Payton on the 2006 heat type of thing. Right. He could go to Dallas and be the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2421.2s)]
*  third best guy on the team, maybe even second, depending on where he is physically at age 40, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2426.96s)]
*  but he could go to Philly and play with Embiid and Maxine. Like there's teams you could put him on [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2433.04s)]
*  where it's like, it's not 2006 Gary Payton. I just don't think he'll do it. But you know, I, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2438.56s)]
*  the question for me is, is he just done chasing rings or not? Cause he has no chance of winning [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2444.8s)]
*  one with the Lakers. I don't think. It would be funny because it would be his fifth and also [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2448.5600000000004s)]
*  would be the least impactful ring, perhaps in NBA history for a star to have his legacy changed at [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2455.92s)]
*  all. Cause nobody's changing their mind on him at this point. There's too much data. I've seen it all. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2462.48s)]
*  Well, no, there's one scenario. If he went to Dallas and played with Luca and Kyrie and then [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2469.1200000000003s)]
*  Luca got hurt in the first round in LeBron's like, I guess I'm going to have to dip back into the [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2473.6s)]
*  way back machine and then won the title. Anyway, it would have to be on a team where the star got [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2478.56s)]
*  hurt and he had to throw it on his back. That would, that would be the scenario. All right. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2483.2s)]
*  I agree with that. I did not think, I still think people will be like, well, yeah, but they, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2488.8s)]
*  Luca did all the regular season work and got him the seed. Yeah. I mean, those guys would just find [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2492.8s)]
*  a way to dump on them anyway. All right. Where's that? Where's Embiid in all this? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2499.2s)]
*  You know, what's funny? I considered him briefly and I just feel like I've given up. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2506.0s)]
*  You've given up. Whoa. I think I have. I think I've given up. He can win me back, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2511.9199999999996s)]
*  but I'm just, I just don't think he gets it. Like even seeing him on that halftime show or whatever, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2518.24s)]
*  the pregame show, the clips, I'm just like, Oh man. Like you haven't come through in one playoff [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2524.88s)]
*  series in your entire career. And I don't even think you realize that. Right. Does he realize that [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2531.76s)]
*  you're 30? Where he and Ben Simmons actually perfect teammates for lack of realization. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2541.44s)]
*  Like at some point it might be you, you know, how many excuses can we have up? I really like Embiid, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2546.96s)]
*  but I still go back to that week when he dropped the 70 on 19 year old Wemba Nyama and then missed [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2554.64s)]
*  the Denver game. And I'm just like, does this guy get it? I don't know. I just don't know. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2560.64s)]
*  You were laughing. Well, I can't believe you said you've given up, even though I [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2569.8399999999997s)]
*  did something similar when I went on part of my take and we were just kind of, it was a conversation [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2574.64s)]
*  that somehow started with like the Tatum windows of possibilities, right? If Tatum wins the finals [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2580.88s)]
*  MVP, which even if the Celtics win this thing, I don't know, he would have to do some, the series [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2587.36s)]
*  would have to go longer. He would have to have some huge, huge games. So it's not, I'm not completely [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2592.48s)]
*  ruling it out. But as of today, you wouldn't feel great about Tatum's chances of finals MVP. And so [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2597.04s)]
*  what the high side of that conversation could be, right? Some of the, Hey, is he actually, is Luca [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2601.28s)]
*  actually better than this guy? And it's like, yeah, Luca is better than him. Okay. I don't even [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2606.48s)]
*  care about what happens in the finals. Like it's ridiculous to me. Then on the low side, if Dallas [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2610.56s)]
*  sort of win the whole thing or what if they blew a three or something like that, like what would [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2616.08s)]
*  happen to this Celtics group? I have to ask you some of those questions a little bit later in the [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2619.92s)]
*  pod, but then it became like, okay, well who are the top four? And that's when Zach Lowe, that clip [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2623.6s)]
*  had gone around and him saying like the top four are irrefutable. And my point was like until further [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2629.44s)]
*  notice, I don't like, and beat is just not waved into that group for me anymore. He just isn't. It [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2635.44s)]
*  doesn't mean I don't think he's like outside of the top 10 or something absurd like that. Of course [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2641.44s)]
*  not. But I'm just, I'm not going to like blindly think of him in the same category that I think of [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2646.32s)]
*  the other top shot creator, massive stack guys, MVP conversation guys. So I don't know if we're [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2654.56s)]
*  saying the same thing. No, you know why, you know why you thought that? Cause he's not reliable. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2660.08s)]
*  He hasn't proven that he can be reliable season to season. He just hasn't. And now he's going to be [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2664.72s)]
*  30. And I'm looking at the history of big dudes and what happens when you just start adding weight [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2669.68s)]
*  every year, just because you're getting older and that's what happens. I don't think he's a reliable [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2674.9599999999996s)]
*  bet from a health standpoint. And I don't know if he gets it. And when I say get it, I mean, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2679.68s)]
*  Hey, and beat like you gotta be in awesome shape, right? The more weight you carry, the more bad [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2686.56s)]
*  things can happen and you can blame whoever, but it ultimately starts with that. I think he [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2692.32s)]
*  obviously works on his game, his offensive game. I think both of us were like, wow, this guy, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2697.76s)]
*  this is the best shooting big man we've ever had. He's an incredible free throw shooter. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2703.92s)]
*  A lot of things to like, but at this point, the reason I put him on is I'd be really surprised [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2710.1600000000003s)]
*  if you flip that narrative. I haven't seen him. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2716.24s)]
*  And maybe he has, and I've missed it, but have you seen like real reflection with him? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2722.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, what am I doing wrong? Maybe I could have maybe going into next year, I have to do this, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2727.12s)]
*  this and this. I just haven't heard it. You hear stuff like you see him on the ESPN show [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2734.8799999999997s)]
*  where he's talking about the Celtics got lucky this year, cause I got hurt. So you get hurt every [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  year. That was a tough look. Now, were they actually debating are the Celtics a dynasty [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2743.92s)]
*  before they won the finals? That was stupid in itself. I'm just wondering. The dumbest thing [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2749.6s)]
*  I've ever seen. As somebody who's worked in television. You got to win a title before we [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2754.7200000000003s)]
*  can have the dynasty combo. Just win the first one. Was Embiid on the desk just so rattled from [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2760.4s)]
*  how terrible that segment producing was? I'm coming up with an excuse for him because maybe [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2769.68s)]
*  he didn't realize, like he saw the tape after because I shouldn't have said that the Celtics [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2776.48s)]
*  were lucky when I was hurt again. He's like, but God, why did we start the B's with are the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2779.7599999999998s)]
*  Celtics a dynasty before they've even won this first one? I did a ringer top hundred. We had the [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2784.96s)]
*  last vote and I think I had Embiid ninth and I wanted to put her higher and I just couldn't [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2793.92s)]
*  justify it. Okay. Give me the eight in front of them. Jokic, Doncic, Giannis, Shea, Tatum. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2799.76s)]
*  I had Brunson sixth. I'm not going to apologize either. Curry said, you shouldn't just an aside [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  on Brunson. I've been prepping now for last week, just cramming for the NBA draft and watching these [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2815.6800000000003s)]
*  small point cards and go, well, that's really cool, but I don't know. All right. That's amazing [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2822.08s)]
*  you did that, but I don't really like the way you're finishing around the rim here and I'm not sure [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2828.56s)]
*  this is going to work or whatever. And then every time all I do is think about Jalen Brunson [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2833.52s)]
*  and what he did this year. He has to be six. Curry seventh. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2837.84s)]
*  Didn't make the playoffs. Like, sorry. Edwards eight. That was the toughest one that Edwards, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2843.6s)]
*  Curry Brunson thing. And then I had Embiid nine. Guess who had number 10? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2850.48s)]
*  Durant. Victor Wembediyama. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2854.8s)]
*  I'm just ready. I'm just, I'm never making a list like that again and not having him in the top 10. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2860.16s)]
*  Just not. NBA.com should do this where they have all the MVP voters vote for like the top 10 players [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2866.56s)]
*  once a month. Well, that's kind of what we were trying to do with the ringer top hundred, but it [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2875.28s)]
*  would be what you just said though is what they should do with the MVP to stay and make it stand [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2881.6800000000003s)]
*  out from all NBA. We should vote for 10 places. There should be like he finished ninth in the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2885.2000000000003s)]
*  MVP voting should be a thing we say. I don't know why we cut it off at five. I like that because [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2890.32s)]
*  this is something that you've brought up and you brought it up in your book. And this is why this [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2895.84s)]
*  stuff matters is you go back and like, I was looking at Charles Barkley and I was trying to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2899.76s)]
*  find these articles from 93 like half off the top of the pot. Like how are people talking about him? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2903.36s)]
*  And then I go, my God, like he had eight top six MVP finishes. Right. And it would be kind of cool [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2908.48s)]
*  if we had 10 slots for the MVP vote, just so you could see like historically where guys lined up. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2914.8s)]
*  Because then when you go through Karl Malone's resume, because I started looking at like Barkley's [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2921.84s)]
*  MVP year against Jordan, then also the Karl Malone years and like how many years he finished [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2925.2000000000003s)]
*  really high in the MVP voting. And granted, you can end up finishing lower than because of just [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2930.56s)]
*  the points and the way the voting works for everything. But if there was like an end of year [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2936.32s)]
*  definitive top 10 list based on the MVP voting, it'd be a great resource to just kind of go back [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2940.08s)]
*  and think of like, this is where this guy lived for this many years of his career, as opposed to [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2945.6800000000003s)]
*  like a peak two or three year season or two career. Larry Bird is the best version of that [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2950.0s)]
*  because he's like, it's like shocking, shocking submission. No, he's, he's I think top three for [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2956.48s)]
*  10 years of the first, first 10 years of the league. Is he really? It's like, no, it's like three, two, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2962.48s)]
*  three, two, one, one, one, two, three. I forget what it is, but yeah. All right. I have it here. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2969.76s)]
*  422211132. Yeah, since his first, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2977.12s)]
*  since his first nine years in the league, like that's crazy. Nobody's going to do that again. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz9cb2RgCA&t=2987.3599999999997s)]
