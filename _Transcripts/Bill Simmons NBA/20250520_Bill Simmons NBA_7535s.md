# The Invincible OKC, Knicks Nirvana and Giannis Trades | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg)
*  It is 813 Pacific time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=0.0s)]
*  Zach low stayed up late tonight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=28.76s)]
*  I was kind of deep down hoping we were going to get a really fun [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=31.0s)]
*  Timberwolves okay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  See game one. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=36.56s)]
*  And then for about a quarter and a half, it felt like we're heading that way. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=37.24s)]
*  And then okay. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=40.68s)]
*  See, does the thing that they do from time to time where their [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=41.28s)]
*  defense just shifts it's shape shifters. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=44.28s)]
*  They just turn it up a different way. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=48.36s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the game's over and you're like, what happened? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=50.32s)]
*  How was this an 18 point game? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=53.44s)]
*  It was just, they were just up by two a second ago and that was it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=58.24s)]
*  You take anything away from this or is it just typical game one? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=59.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, the wolves are ahead by four points halfway through the third [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=62.32s)]
*  quarter, Mike Conley had a little, had a little flurry, little flurry. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=66.64s)]
*  Mike Conley hit a three. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=69.88s)]
*  It was 60 to 56 with seven 22 left. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=70.72s)]
*  But look, I said this before the series, I picked thunder in six. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=73.6s)]
*  Don't feel any better. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=77.44s)]
*  I guess I have to feel slightly better about that pick, but the bottom line is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=78.56s)]
*  this, the most consistent unit, let's call it left in the playoffs is Oklahoma [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=81.92s)]
*  city's defense every single night. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=87.28s)]
*  They're going to be an absolute bear to score on them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=89.92s)]
*  No one has really found an answer at any point of the season. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=92.44s)]
*  Denver did pretty well against them in the regular season. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=96.4s)]
*  Spoiler alert, that did not last until playoffs, even with the best player in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=98.72s)]
*  the world, yeah, trying every trick he has. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=102.04s)]
*  And they just reach a frenzy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=106.28s)]
*  And you know, like Julius Randall posting up, it's just like, watch out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=108.84s)]
*  Like, where's it, where's the hell is there any help coming from? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=113.2s)]
*  Is Lou Dork going to pull the chair? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=115.32s)]
*  Where are the arms? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=116.56s)]
*  There's arms everywhere. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=117.12s)]
*  And, you know, look, uh, 17 turnovers doesn't sound that bad for Minnesota. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=118.52s)]
*  I mean, it's not great, but it doesn't sound that bad. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=124.84s)]
*  13 of those were steals and that plus a free throw margin that is even and, or [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=126.72s)]
*  slightly an edge to Oklahoma City is just the wolves are dead on arrival [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=132.72s)]
*  against this defensive. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=137.24s)]
*  Those stats trend that way. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=138.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=140.28s)]
*  It felt like this was the game. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=140.56s)]
*  About 30, 40 minutes in and it's like, all right, they're going to get this one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=143.2s)]
*  If they're going to get a game, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=146.12s)]
*  Everything's going well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Randall's playing out of his ass and, uh, okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=148.68s)]
*  So he looked nervous and okay. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=151.44s)]
*  So he looked a little tired from maybe that seven gamer. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=153.52s)]
*  And it was interesting when Ken Rich Williams came in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=157.76s)]
*  Love it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=160.12s)]
*  Kenny hustle, baby. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=160.52s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  Like would he have been the fifth best nugget? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=162.88s)]
*  Where do you have him ranked on nuggets? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=164.96s)]
*  Could he have played 35 minutes a game for the nuggets? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=166.88s)]
*  He's he was plus 19 and nine minutes made every shot that he took. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=169.44s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=173.72s)]
*  So when he did that, I'm like, is this a tactical move or did he extend the bench [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=174.68s)]
*  today because he was worried his team was a little worn out or what's going on? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  And did he lose faith in Caruso all of a sudden? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=184.0s)]
*  And then Caruso came in and played one of the great stretches he's had in the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  playoffs. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  So that was that answered that question. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=194.44000000000003s)]
*  Caruso is making threes guarding Randall as I think, I think everyone was reminded [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  that, oh yeah, he's going to guard Randall when he guarded Jokic at the end of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  series and Ken Rich Williams. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=203.0s)]
*  He's like a beloved guy there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=204.48s)]
*  You know, for years they've been saying he's going to be Nick Collison 2.0 for us. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=206.32s)]
*  He's just going to be a lifer here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=210.04s)]
*  We love him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=211.56s)]
*  He's about all the right things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=212.04s)]
*  Hadn't really done much in the playoffs in the real playoffs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=214.08s)]
*  I'm not going to count the Memphis series. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=216.84s)]
*  It's a cool moment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=219.2s)]
*  He may not do much from here on out, but that's a big, that was a big stretch of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  basketball for him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=223.44s)]
*  It was a cool moment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=224.16s)]
*  Was he had a big three too. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=225.16s)]
*  So the things I was worried about heading into this game, what are we getting from [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=227.8s)]
*  Mike Conley who's old going against this gauntlet you called on Sunday's pod or [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=232.16s)]
*  Monday's pod. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=238.04s)]
*  You said you thought, okay, sees defenses now going way up there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=238.72s)]
*  I want to see it for four rounds because I, I, I I'm still licking my wounds from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=243.28s)]
*  jumping the gun with Minnesota last year when they look good in round two and all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=248.72s)]
*  of a sudden I was comparing them to the 89 piston. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=252.44s)]
*  So I'm just, I have the training wheels on for all defense takes in these playoffs. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=254.48s)]
*  But I, you know, the bones are there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=259.8s)]
*  I think what makes them special is, is the different looks and how they can do the big [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=262.96s)]
*  and small, how they can put like, Oh, we're just going to try to get a lot of steals [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=266.76s)]
*  lineup. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=270.6s)]
*  They, they have looks like a football team that I don't really remember seeing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=271.08s)]
*  I guess the, the, you know, you go back to the 89 pistons and teams of that ilk that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=275.24s)]
*  could kind of change their look, depending on what you had. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  They're on pace, but what they did today is they do it over and over again. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=284.56s)]
*  They just go on these runs and their defense fueled, which is so unusual in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=288.56s)]
*  league, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=292.84s)]
*  The runs that we usually have in the league are threes and, or somebody getting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  hot. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=299.64s)]
*  This team can have runs based on steals and pressure and picking up guys at half [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=300.64s)]
*  court. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  That one sequence, I know you know what I'm about to say when Edwards was bringing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=305.52s)]
*  the ball up and Caruso kind of jumped on him and then he almost lost, he almost [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=309.56s)]
*  fell over for a back court just because of the pressure and then got it back and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=314.92s)]
*  then just like launched a terrible three. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=319.36s)]
*  Nobody else is doing that in the league. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=321.36s)]
*  And I think that's what makes them special is they just throw things defensively. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=323.76s)]
*  They're like, I'm not seeing that anywhere. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=327.12s)]
*  Yeah, they have, they have a couple every game where it's just, Oh, the guy just [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=330.12s)]
*  either fell over along the sideline under pressure, bringing the ball up or [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=334.8s)]
*  dribble the ball off his foot, or I don't quite know what happened. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=338.64s)]
*  I have to watch the replay to see what went haywire here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=342.12s)]
*  But you mentioned different looks and you know, I was talking about this before [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  the series we saw, I said, it's going to be a safer series to play Chet as the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=349.24s)]
*  only big guy on the floor. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=353.96s)]
*  They were afraid to do it against Denver very much. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=355.12s)]
*  And they did it a lot today. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=357.24s)]
*  Hartenstein only played 20 minutes and chat was awesome. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=358.32s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't jump off the stat sheet, you know, 15, seven, three. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=361.88s)]
*  I just thought he made the kind of plays he needs to make on offense for them to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=366.0s)]
*  win the championship to for them to win 16 playoff games. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=370.0s)]
*  Going to have to hit some threes. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=372.48s)]
*  He had just won, but he was one of one, some tough twos, some good takes around [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=373.56s)]
*  the basket and just he's, they have him guarding either McDaniels or a little bit [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=377.28s)]
*  go bear, never Julius Randall. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=382.12s)]
*  They were like, we're just keeping you away from that matchup. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=384.32s)]
*  He's going to bulldoze you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=386.56s)]
*  And he's saving your sternum and your ribs. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=387.92s)]
*  He's, we're going to make you, we're going to preserve you as a help defender. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=389.96s)]
*  A lot. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=393.16s)]
*  And he's just everywhere. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=393.36s)]
*  Like there was that one play where he had, he switched onto Devin Schenzo on the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=394.44s)]
*  right corner because the wolves kind of moved around their office a little bit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  And even Chet's like, cool, I'll just drive baseline and see what happens. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=401.08s)]
*  And what happens is Chet's like, you're just going to eat the basketball for [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=403.68s)]
*  dinner. How's that? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=406.44s)]
*  How does that feel? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=407.08s)]
*  He was, he was awesome. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=407.64s)]
*  And then we saw them close the game. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=409.0s)]
*  I mean, the game was already kind of closed, but with no bigs on the floor, they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=410.48s)]
*  went to their sort of all wing, all guards, switch everything. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=413.92s)]
*  Good luck figuring this thing out. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=416.6s)]
*  Lineup and you know, they have a little bit more lineup flexibility, I think in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=418.36s)]
*  this series than they did against Denver. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=423.0s)]
*  And look, Minnesota had 88 points, 88 points. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think we, I guess we got to talk about the threes, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=429.0s)]
*  15 to 51. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=431.8s)]
*  53 is 88 points is never a good ratio. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=433.08s)]
*  Hard to win in the NBA in 2025 when the other team takes 30 more threes than you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  And yet they won running away and I'm the tracking data. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=442.32s)]
*  Nerves are already flagging it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=447.0s)]
*  They're already awaiting the second spectrum data tomorrow. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  And did Minnesota underperform their expected shot variation by, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=451.08s)]
*  was this just a shot luck game? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=455.04s)]
*  And I'll be interested to see what that data actually says because they missed [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  some good ones, but man, they make you take, first of all, no defense is better [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  at helping making you think you're open and then flying back at you while another [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=465.40000000000003s)]
*  guy stunts at you. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=471.04s)]
*  So at least there's like stuff happening in your line of sight. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, the guy flying at me has gigantic arms and he's really fast and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=475.64s)]
*  he's like 23 years old and at the peak of his, that his athleticism and a lot of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=479.8s)]
*  them watching in real time and we're doing this right after the game. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=484.2s)]
*  I haven't gone back and rewatched them yet. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=486.64s)]
*  They felt like long threes and a lot like early in the shot clock threes and even [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=488.32s)]
*  the ones that are decent and 29 feet early in the shot clock are long and have [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=493.32s)]
*  the feel of like, well, I better shoot this one now cause it's pretty good and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=497.92s)]
*  we, we ain't getting anything better than this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=501.12s)]
*  I'm letting it fly. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=502.76s)]
*  And you know, I thought for the most part, a lot of those threes were like [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=504.32s)]
*  decently contested. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  And for a lot of this game, it was Minnesota missing tough threes and Oklahoma [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  city missing tough twos. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  And I think what should scare Minnesota a little bit is Oklahoma city started [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=518.0s)]
*  getting easier twos and making more of the twos as the game went on. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=521.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=525.6s)]
*  Well, if you're Minnesota, the one thing you're going to come out of the game is [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=526.64s)]
*  we have to get a better whistle on these SGA calls. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=529.84s)]
*  Oh, they were furious. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=532.9200000000001s)]
*  The whole game. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=533.76s)]
*  I mean, they were, they were going into the game, which is always kind of a bad [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=534.2s)]
*  sign. If you're already like on edge about it, it's, it's like, you're, you're, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=538.08s)]
*  it feels like you're, you just got to chill out a little bit, except that it's [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  going to be bad, but yeah, I'm sure some clips will be sent to the league office [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=545.0s)]
*  between games one and two. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=549.36s)]
*  Deservedly. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=550.6s)]
*  Look, I, you know, I tweeted this in real time and I never tweet during games [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=551.88s)]
*  usually, but I just thought Shay and I don't, I don't care. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't bet on the game. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=559.64s)]
*  I didn't really care who won. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=561.2s)]
*  I just hope we have a long, fun series, but I feel like Shay is getting this [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=562.48s)]
*  whistle that nobody else in the playoffs is getting where there's little touch [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=566.84s)]
*  fouls or these bumps where you're not even sure who initiated the bumps and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=571.12s)]
*  he's just getting it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=574.52s)]
*  And I think with Minnesota, you can see this, you saw it in the Laker series. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  You saw in the last series, McDaniels can just have four or five fouls [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=580.24s)]
*  immediately and you don't even know what happened. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=584.32s)]
*  And when, when he has fouls, I think Minnesota is a different team because [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=586.44s)]
*  he's kind of, he's their swing guy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=592.24s)]
*  Every team has a swing guy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=594.08s)]
*  I feel like he's their swing guy. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=595.4s)]
*  And once you put foul trouble on him and he's not as, uh, not as aggressive, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=597.48s)]
*  it's, then it comes down to like his aunt or, you know, are the threes [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=602.76s)]
*  going to go in or his aunt going to go nuts? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=606.8s)]
*  The bench guys were also really bad. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  And there's a, there's officially a Nas Reed storyline that's developed [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=611.04s)]
*  where he's been bad for three weeks now. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=614.6s)]
*  Where he hasn't looked like this guy, like when they, when they really [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=618.52s)]
*  got hot, when Randall was out, I think it was like February range. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  And he was like 20 to 25 a night and, you know, seven, eight rebounds a game. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=624.72s)]
*  And was like really impactful. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=630.2s)]
*  I don't think he's figured out how to impact the team. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=632.12s)]
*  Now that Randall is looking like Randall and, uh, today he was one for 11. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=634.7600000000001s)]
*  Obviously it's about as bad as it's going to get, but you do that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=639.32s)]
*  Alexander Walker's three for 11 and, and Dante was three for 14. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=641.7600000000001s)]
*  They're not really built to survive three shit bench games. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=646.7600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=650.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=650.44s)]
*  Five of 28 on threes combined for those three guys. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  First of all, 28 threes for three bench guys. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=657.84s)]
*  That's almost an accomplishment in and of itself. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  Like you're almost having three bench guys take 10 threes of ease. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=663.1600000000001s)]
*  And you said that about, even Missoula is like, I don't know. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=669.2s)]
*  I thought, I thought Missoula would be like in, in like the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=670.6s)]
*  jungles of the Amazon by now. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=674.6s)]
*  Yeah, he probably is. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=677.0s)]
*  He doesn't have cable right now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=677.84s)]
*  He has no cable, no streaming right now. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=679.12s)]
*  You know, you said that about Nas read and it seemed like a little unfair to me. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=682.24s)]
*  Cause I, in my head, I mean, it's like been a while since the wolves played in my [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=686.48s)]
*  head, I'm like, he's had some pretty good games. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=689.96s)]
*  I'm looking back last three games against golden state, all single digits. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=691.2s)]
*  First two, he had 30 combined and then two single digit games against the Lakers. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=694.88s)]
*  A really good game one, which maybe is the one that's sticking in my head, but [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=699.6s)]
*  since then, very quiet, very quiet and it winter lose this series and whatever. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  Obviously Minnesota and their new ownership is going to have some big [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=709.04s)]
*  financial decisions to make and he's a big one. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=713.04s)]
*  I didn't realize we were going there already. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=716.64s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=718.48s)]
*  We're not. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=719.12s)]
*  I'm just saying you brought it up free agents, but there's also no calf space. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=719.52s)]
*  And he's such a legend there and deservedly. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=725.16s)]
*  So like the, just people just screaming Nas read in the streets and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=727.8s)]
*  holding the Nas read towels. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=732.12s)]
*  I hope he stays there forever. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  But look, I think Minnesota will work their way into this series, but this [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=734.5999999999999s)]
*  game was, um, not, not the start you were hoping for it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=738.0s)]
*  Could you come out of this like, Oh geez, man with this is going to be tough to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=744.44s)]
*  score enough against these guys. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=747.52s)]
*  It exacerbated all the things I was worried about, which is ball handling [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=749.72s)]
*  Conley's age, the fact that they don't really have a backup point guard, that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=753.68s)]
*  it seems like Edwards is going to have to have the ball a lot and I think, okay. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=757.6s)]
*  So he was ready for that, especially in the second half, you could say like, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=761.6s)]
*  Oh, you're going to have Edwards, bring it up. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=764.36s)]
*  We're going to actually make it really difficult for him. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=765.68s)]
*  And okay. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=768.28s)]
*  See with the, especially at home with the ability to snap this, snap [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=769.12s)]
*  the switch for four minutes. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=773.04s)]
*  I'm worried for Minnesota. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=776.0s)]
*  Um, cause I'm trying to think what's the roadmap for them to be awesome in this [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=777.64s)]
*  series, when you think how bad okay. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=781.96s)]
*  See played for the first half of this game, basically for them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=783.56s)]
*  And then they still win the game easily. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=787.04s)]
*  Um, I guess it starts with Edwards. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=789.24s)]
*  It was only 18 points. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=791.4s)]
*  Um, typical, like weird feeling it out. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=793.96s)]
*  He does this sometimes. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=796.84s)]
*  He didn't, there was a Laker game like this too. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=797.88s)]
*  There was the first game of the warrior series where it's like this. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=800.32s)]
*  It's almost like a feel out game, but it lasts the whole game. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=803.92s)]
*  And then the game's over and they lost, but I would assume he's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=806.32s)]
*  going to come out way more aggressive. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=809.52s)]
*  I, you know, you do have to remind yourself all the time. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=812.4s)]
*  Don't overreact to game one, even if it, even, and maybe especially if it [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=815.28s)]
*  confirms to your expectations about how the series would go, cause then your [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=819.68s)]
*  tendency is to really overreact to it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=822.64s)]
*  Um, roadmap number one is hit four more threes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=825.36s)]
*  If you're going to take 50 and that, that does a lot of the work for you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=829.0s)]
*  But I will continue to 19, 20. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=832.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=834.24s)]
*  I'll continue to say this. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=834.52s)]
*  Like if they lose the turnover, if they lose the live ball turnover battle like [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=835.8s)]
*  that, because Oklahoma city had 12 turnovers, only five of those were steals. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=840.2s)]
*  So that's what did I say? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=843.64s)]
*  13 steals to five steals. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=845.04s)]
*  If they lose that battle that badly and they don't win the free throw battle by [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=847.16s)]
*  a significant margin, they're just not going to win games. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=851.24s)]
*  There's just no math that's going to help them win games with step one is the threes. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=853.4s)]
*  The ant thing, like grade the ant. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=857.4s)]
*  What, what grade would you give ant this game? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=860.48s)]
*  He does have games like this where like he has moments and first of all, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=862.36s)]
*  for him D plus, wow. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=866.0s)]
*  For him, not deep across the board for him. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=868.52s)]
*  What do you want more of? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=872.0s)]
*  What did you, what did you see that concerned you swagger? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  I want, I want, yo, we're playing the best team in the league and I'm in their house [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=877.6s)]
*  and I'm stealing this game from them. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=882.36s)]
*  I didn't feel that at all in this game. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=884.64s)]
*  Now he did get hurt in the first, in the first half. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=886.28s)]
*  And I don't know if that tweaked, whatever was going on and on Randall also had a [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=888.6s)]
*  huge first half. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=893.2s)]
*  So maybe you back off, but, um, he's got to win the swagger battle with this. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=894.2s)]
*  That this you beat. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=899.88s)]
*  See by it's, it sounds stupid and it's the opposite of second spectrum. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=900.16s)]
*  And I liked your second spectrum voice that you broke out by the way, the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=905.24s)]
*  you're nerdy second spectrum. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=907.96s)]
*  It's like, you know, I always tell people like, yeah, I said it about the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=909.16s)]
*  self-except for game, game one and game two against the next hang the, hang the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=912.0s)]
*  shot quality championship banner. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=915.6s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=917.08s)]
*  You had better shot quality. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=917.92s)]
*  You're, you're down two O in the series. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=918.8s)]
*  You got nothing for that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=920.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=921.84s)]
*  I think for him, he's got to be talking shit. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=922.32s)]
*  He's got to feel like he's the alpha on the court. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=925.68s)]
*  I didn't feel that at all in this game. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=929.16s)]
*  Randall, ironically, was the one that was starting to carry himself that way. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=930.64s)]
*  And it was interesting to watch. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=933.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=934.72s)]
*  So he swing there, everything they were doing defensively to try to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=935.0s)]
*  just kind of take him out. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=938.6s)]
*  I mean, the Caruso piece of this, I was thinking how, as you know, I always [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=939.72s)]
*  want more awards because I think we need stuff to commemorate the season. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=945.6s)]
*  Well, after the fact and be like, oh, that was the season when this happened [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=950.2s)]
*  and this happened and this happened. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=953.2s)]
*  If we had a role player, the playoffs award, it feel like Caruso would be [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=955.84s)]
*  like minus 700 on Fandl to take it at this point. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=960.44s)]
*  He to watch somebody guard Randall. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=964.12s)]
*  Edwards and Jokic. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=967.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, in a 48 hour span, who else is doing that? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=969.76s)]
*  Who else is in the, does it have to be a bench guy? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=975.48s)]
*  Like is Josh Hart in the conversation? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  Is Andrew Nemhart in the conversation? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=981.6s)]
*  Those guys are other leaders. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=983.92s)]
*  You have to think of it like it's, it's a movie poster and it can't be somebody [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=986.0s)]
*  who would be one of the two or three faces in the movie poster or in the, like [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=990.48s)]
*  the TNT that when they're doing the commercial for the game, it would be [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=994.28s)]
*  weird if they were in the game. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=999.04s)]
*  Like Julius Randall is not eligible. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1000.28s)]
*  He's Aaron Gordon too good for, for, for that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1001.92s)]
*  I think he is because if you're doing the nuggets movie poster, it's the three guys. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1006.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  So it'd be Christian Brown in that case would be your role. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1010.12s)]
*  Movie poster is just Jokic sitting on the bench looking sad as, as the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1012.88s)]
*  lead is like Frid frittered away. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1017.24s)]
*  They always cut to him. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1019.16s)]
*  It was the first, it was the Nico Harrison in the crowd cut when [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1020.4s)]
*  anything bad would happen. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1023.76s)]
*  And then it became the Jokic on the bench. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  Can't he's looking up and it's like, Oh, there's 11 minutes and 10 [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1027.08s)]
*  seconds left in the fourth quarter. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1031.92s)]
*  I probably can't come back yet. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1033.52s)]
*  They want to, they, they told me they wanted me to get to nine minutes. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1036.16s)]
*  How did that? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1039.08s)]
*  Oh God, brush just turned the ball over again. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1039.56s)]
*  Oh, now it's 10 50. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1041.72s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1044.84s)]
*  Can we talk a little more about it? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1045.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1047.12s)]
*  So like the simplest explanation for why Oklahoma city is, is very [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1048.3200000000002s)]
*  difficult to play against is if you're an, and you have the ball at the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1054.4s)]
*  top of the top of the arc, like what, what direction are you going against this? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1057.96s)]
*  Defense? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1064.0s)]
*  There's no easy Mark to go at. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1064.44s)]
*  I thought at the beginning of the game, he was starting to get traction in [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1068.04s)]
*  the go bear pick and roll just like, like not softest part of the defense, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1071.68s)]
*  but just, I can always get a big guy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1076.56s)]
*  Like get Hardenstein up, up the floor and like, maybe I can get around him or [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1079.04s)]
*  there's a pocket pass to go bear or something and then go barely ends up [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1082.96s)]
*  playing 20 minutes, they play Chet at center quite a bit when Isaiah Joe was [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1086.12s)]
*  on the floor and really wanted to go at him and they couldn't get that switch. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1090.2s)]
*  Like the thunder were really good at hedging recovering and like you take [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1094.2s)]
*  that out of it and it's like, I don't know where to go and you could try [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1097.48s)]
*  Shay, but ant has not really developed like the sort of back to the basket, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1102.12s)]
*  um, bully ball game that I think he'd like. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1107.76s)]
*  I mean, he and I talked about it three, four years ago in a phone interview. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1110.12s)]
*  He would like to do that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1112.72s)]
*  And it just hasn't, it's just a, there's just not a lot of places to pick at. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1114.0s)]
*  Whereas I thought the thunder gradually were like, oh, Shay was like, okay, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1117.96s)]
*  particularly when go bears off the floor, I can get someplace against Randall. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1122.76s)]
*  I can attack Nas Reed's feet in the pick and roll. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1127.08s)]
*  Like I got played. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1129.52s)]
*  It's not great. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1130.36s)]
*  Like this is a really good defensive team too, but I got things I can do. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1131.16s)]
*  And ant is still figuring out kind of where he wants to poke at. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1134.88s)]
*  And I think he's going to have a game where he finds the right, the right [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1138.0400000000002s)]
*  places and stuff starts to open up for him. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1140.92s)]
*  Maybe part of it is like, like he likes to go one-on-one. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  He's an incredible one-on-one player and he can beat almost anybody one-on-one [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1145.88s)]
*  and he had a couple of those in this game. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1151.0s)]
*  But again, it's like, if it's case in Wallace or somebody like that, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1153.44s)]
*  like that's no picnic and they're going to pick you a lot of the time too. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1156.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1158.76s)]
*  Kason Wallace was in there for a little bit and you. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1159.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1162.48s)]
*  So it was that's two guys you just completely forgot were on the team. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1162.68s)]
*  And then they're just kicking ass for three straight minutes. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1165.92s)]
*  I think the thing that okay. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1168.72s)]
*  See seems like they love is if somebody is going straight up one-on-one. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1169.8s)]
*  Almost like the old school one forward. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1174.44s)]
*  And it's like, I'm going to go one-on-one beat a guy and just try to get to the basket. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1176.08s)]
*  They're like, great, please try that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1179.6s)]
*  We're we're ready in so many different ways. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1181.84s)]
*  It seems like you got to attack them on the sides with angles. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1183.68s)]
*  Cause I feel like the Celtics fell into the same kind of issues with Tatum when it would go bad, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1186.28s)]
*  when it was always like him 40 feet from the basket, straight ahead. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1190.92s)]
*  Versus when they would put him on the left or the right and he could kind of veer toward the paint [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1194.84s)]
*  and decide like what to do off the dribble. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1200.24s)]
*  I always felt like he was better. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1202.56s)]
*  Maybe that's what they're going to have to do with Edwards. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1203.76s)]
*  And I thought they found something in the first half of the go bear pick and rolls and then they just stopped. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1205.32s)]
*  There was a play in the second half where I don't remember exactly. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1210.32s)]
*  It was an ant pick and roll. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1213.36s)]
*  Maybe with go bear and he got case and Wallace on his hip and got him trapped kind of behind him and then [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1214.4799999999998s)]
*  snaked it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1220.28s)]
*  So he changed directions and it looked like he was going to have a driving lane to the right. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1221.28s)]
*  And that if go bear was the screener, let's just say go bear was going to seal off everyone on the other side of the floor. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1225.6799999999998s)]
*  And Caruso just ran in from the right corner off Alexander Walker and it was like, oh my God. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1238.6799999999998s)]
*  I'll kick the ball to Alexander Walker. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1239.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1240.6s)]
*  I'll kick the ball to Alexander Walker. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1240.88s)]
*  And in real time, I thought they had switched and then I rewatched it and it was like, no, Caruso just ran all the way back to Alexander Walker, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1242.52s)]
*  contested the three. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1250.08s)]
*  So Alexander Walker had to pump, put the ball on the floor for one dribble, rise up for a three. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1251.48s)]
*  And then here comes case and Wallace coming at me. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1256.48s)]
*  And it was like a decent three. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1258.6s)]
*  But it's an example of ant just couldn't get like an easy feel for there's a clear path to the rim and I'm taking it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1260.08s)]
*  And then they're just flying at you and making you take like some decent threes, some bad threes. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1268.4s)]
*  So there's a great, I mean, look, it's not breaking news. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1274.3600000000001s)]
*  They're an awesome defensive team. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1277.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, the problem if you're the other team that's playing whoever the favorite, you kind of have to win game one. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1280.1200000000001s)]
*  I feel like to pull off an upset. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  The Thunder were 68 and 14 this season. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1288.52s)]
*  They're eight and three in the playoffs. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1292.16s)]
*  Now you have to beat them four to six times, basically, to send them packing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1294.3600000000001s)]
*  And that includes winning at least one game on the road. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1297.64s)]
*  Right. And I guess game seven on the road. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1301.96s)]
*  Just a tall task. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1305.88s)]
*  I thought this was the game they had to steal, especially OKC definitely seemed tired that first half. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1308.0400000000002s)]
*  Randall's playing great. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1312.8000000000002s)]
*  This is the game you probably take. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1313.8400000000001s)]
*  So I don't I don't really know. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  In terms of tweaks, I feel like it's going to be easier for OKC to tweak this and use the, you know, the last quarter and a half to their advantage. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1319.2s)]
*  Hey, we worked with Fandool long hours trying to figure out a great idea for the NBA playoffs. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1327.6799999999998s)]
*  And we stumbled into a really good one that we've done for the last couple of weeks. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  We've won two weeks in a row. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1336.04s)]
*  It's called tail or fade. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1337.28s)]
*  I make a prop that I like. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1340.7199999999998s)]
*  And you can either back me or you can go against me. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1344.04s)]
*  And it's hit the last two weeks and it's going to hit again this week because we were going Carl Anthony Towns under 24 and a half points. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1346.84s)]
*  It's the first under prop that I've done. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1353.48s)]
*  And by the way, if you think I'm wrong, fade me, go the other way. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1356.36s)]
*  I think he's going to score 25 points or more. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1360.04s)]
*  There's a little minus action on this. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1361.8799999999999s)]

*  I know we've talked about it, prepared for it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1472.76s)]

*  It just seems like they're gonna win this and it still feels like they have their future ahead of them, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1480.0s)]
*  which is a really unusual place for a champion to be. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1485.8000000000002s)]

*  about Nas Reed's free agency and then you're like, are we going to talk about [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1497.28s)]

*  Seven wins away now. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1501.48s)]
*  And it doesn't, I feel like Denver might've been the best chance to beat them. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1502.76s)]
*  Well, I think even as limited as that team was when they, when they beat Denver. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1507.24s)]
*  And it's always hard to go through a proven champion with the best player. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1511.76s)]
*  When they beat Denver, they were very clearly like the bedding, the solid [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1516.04s)]
*  favor to win the championship tonight only reinforced that. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1520.08s)]
*  But there are still seven wins to go and three tough teams and a lot of [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1523.48s)]
*  randomness health stuff, who knows what could pop up, but yeah, I mean, I [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1527.96s)]
*  picked them to make the finals this year. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1531.8s)]
*  I thought I picked Boston over Oklahoma city as my, as my, so I'm not surprised. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1533.32s)]
*  And it doesn't feel premature to me in part because. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1538.0s)]
*  You know, they, they had people kind of like, like sometimes talk as if last [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1541.56s)]
*  season's playoff run was so crushingly disappointing and so short. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1548.56s)]
*  That was a real like new, the new Orleans series in the first round was a walkover, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1552.48s)]
*  but Dallas was a team that ended up making the finals with two generationally [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1556.28s)]
*  elite ball handlers and a lot of sides and a lot of problems. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1561.08s)]
*  And like, they had to problem solve at a high level. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1564.44s)]
*  They, they failed. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1566.96s)]
*  They lost the series, but it was a very close series. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1567.9199999999998s)]
*  It easily could have gone seven easily could have gone the other way. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1569.9199999999998s)]
*  Like that was real playoff experience. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1573.08s)]
*  And then they completely like the Hartenstein Caruso double dip completely [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1575.04s)]
*  changes their team in a lot of different ways and they're, they're, they're [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1580.08s)]
*  ready for this. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1583.72s)]
*  It sure feels like it. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1585.84s)]
*  They Denver thing really put some chest hair on them. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1588.08s)]
*  And I was talking to some people yesterday about the Denver game. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1591.64s)]
*  I don't obviously they didn't break Yoke edge. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1596.64s)]
*  She's incredible, but it was interesting to watch him run out of solutions. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1598.68s)]
*  And I potted right afterwards. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1603.16s)]
*  It was for so long, but I was still thinking about the game after. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1604.68s)]
*  And, um, when they just weren't able to get him the ball, it's unbelievable [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1607.36s)]
*  for, for long swaths of the game, you know, and, and finally Yoke edge, like. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1614.12s)]
*  He really didn't shoot them. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1621.24s)]
*  I think he had 17 points at halftime. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1622.56s)]
*  He might've finished with 20. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1624.56s)]
*  Um, I felt like they broke the nuggets a little bit in that game. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1626.6s)]
*  I that's another team. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1630.76s)]
*  It's not just that you're, uh, you know, I have a chance to win the title. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1632.5600000000002s)]
*  You're also leaving wreckage of teams behind. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1636.16s)]
*  I don't know what happens to that Denver team going forward or what the moves are [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1638.72s)]
*  or how you fix kind of this nucleus that feels like it's just not going to be [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1642.8400000000001s)]
*  good enough anymore. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1647.5600000000002s)]
*  Um, but that's, that's a piece of it. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1648.88s)]
*  And it goes back to what something I talked about on Sunday and you've talked [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1651.72s)]
*  about in your pot too, is it feels, it feels like there's some sort of shift [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1654.92s)]
*  this season that we're moving into the ha the second half of the decade, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1658.44s)]
*  literally, and all of the teams that mattered the first half of the decade [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1664.3200000000002s)]
*  for the most part are going by the wayside. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  And now we have this new kind of new crop of teams that are just going to be in our [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1671.0800000000002s)]
*  lives. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1676.44s)]
*  The question for me is whether Minnesota can stay there with the tax stuff [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1676.96s)]
*  regardless of what happens in this year. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1681.2s)]
*  So they're going to be able to pay Nasrid. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1682.68s)]
*  Do they have the pockets to do that? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1684.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, how are they going to handle Randall if he ops out, which I think he, there's [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1686.24s)]
*  a chance he might. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1691.16s)]
*  I mean, if that's all, well, it's all going to be, I mean, he'll know if he, if [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1693.8000000000002s)]
*  he ops out, he'll know he's opting out for something better than opting in. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1698.68s)]
*  I don't want, I still want to talk about Minnesota counters and what else they [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1703.88s)]
*  can do. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1707.5200000000002s)]
*  I don't want to be, I don't want to go this far. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1707.88s)]
*  This is too, this is too far for me. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1709.68s)]
*  This is, this is why we're talking it out. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1711.4s)]
*  Uh, offensive rebounding. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1713.96s)]
*  There was a moment where it felt like, Oh, they're going to be able to kind of [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1716.3200000000002s)]
*  bully this team on the glass. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1720.16s)]
*  And then it faded away. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1721.5200000000002s)]
*  I think we got to see more of that. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1723.3200000000002s)]
*  Uh, I was surprised. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1725.72s)]
*  I think they only played one possession of zone in the whole game. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1728.8000000000002s)]
*  And it felt like it was more to protect Jayden McDaniels or maybe Jayden McDaniels [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  got taken out right before. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1737.2800000000002s)]
*  I thought that was going to be something they went to a little bit more, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1738.3600000000001s)]
*  particularly after watching Denver kind of trouble them a little bit with the [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1741.96s)]
*  zone. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1745.72s)]
*  I wonder if they're just like, we don't want to play that card right away in game [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1746.52s)]
*  one. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1749.2s)]
*  We want to see what our man to man defense can do. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1749.4s)]
*  Um, you know, there's a couple, a couple of things they go bear, go bear two [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  points, three rebounds. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1757.3200000000002s)]
*  It's just, it's just gotta be like 12 points, 14 rebounds. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1759.3200000000002s)]
*  Eight of those rebounds are offensive rebounds. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1763.44s)]
*  Like if he's going to play and they're going to win, it's gotta be something like [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1765.4s)]
*  that. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1768.28s)]
*  They did something with him. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1769.2s)]
*  He did the drive down the middle. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1770.28s)]
*  Where it seems like he's going to do a scoop shot and then he just whips it out [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1772.76s)]
*  to the side. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1776.3200000000002s)]
*  I forget which OKC player was like, you're passing into the corner and just stood [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1777.8000000000002s)]
*  there and took the ball in the pass. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1781.44s)]
*  Do you think Minnesota's like the guys on the bench have like had training [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1782.92s)]
*  sessions about, okay, guys, when Rudy starts to do that, you can't start [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1787.72s)]
*  laughing. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1793.0800000000002s)]
*  You can't like hide. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1793.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you, you, you've got to just like stare straight ahead. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1794.64s)]
*  A two foot layup for a kick out to the corner. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1797.0800000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1801.4s)]
*  So you think more go bear just more, three point luck has to change. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1801.6000000000001s)]
*  Aunt goes way more Alfie. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1807.16s)]
*  Shea doesn't get the same calls. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1809.64s)]
*  McDaniels is able to actually stay in the court and be McDaniels. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1812.44s)]
*  I think that's the recipe. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1816.64s)]
*  I still don't know if it's enough. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1818.0s)]
*  I mean, I thought thunder and six. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1819.96s)]
*  Uh, so I, I don't think it's all going to be enough, but that's what I had too. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1822.0800000000002s)]
*  I thought, I thought Minnesota would get two wins somehow. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1826.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know where they're coming from now. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1829.48s)]
*  Five just feels for a team that is what eight and two in the playoffs coming [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1831.36s)]
*  into this and made the conference finals last year, it five just feels like [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1836.12s)]
*  they've earned a little bit more respect than that. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1839.76s)]
*  And seven felt too much. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1841.3999999999999s)]
*  Seven felt like that's, that's too many. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1842.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm going six. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1845.04s)]
*  So quickly on Randall, I was looking up cause I was bored once that game got out [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1847.12s)]
*  of hand, I was looking at Randall's weird career. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1851.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, he's averaging for his career 19 and nine. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1855.76s)]
*  And I looked up how many guys have played 700 plus games and average 19 and nine. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1858.8s)]
*  What do you think the number is? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1866.24s)]
*  Number of players in the history of the NBA, 19 and nine, 19 points, nine [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1867.44s)]
*  rebounds again, that's it. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1871.0s)]

*  Multiple hall of famers, guys, multiple guys who are in the top 20 all time. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1904.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, and then if you go that same list where 3.5 assists a game that [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1909.52s)]
*  then that list goes down to 10. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1916.04s)]

*  Is that what you're doing? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1920.32s)]
*  I, I gotta say, I did not realize I kind of given up on Randall as like a real [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1921.92s)]
*  asset, but I've been so impressed with him in the playoffs that it's making me [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1927.52s)]
*  re-evaluate like, did I get something wrong? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1932.24s)]
*  Did he get better? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1934.6s)]
*  Was he this good the whole time? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1935.3999999999999s)]

*  And he's just, I don't know how it happened, but he's probably the most [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1949.48s)]
*  polarizing guy in the league, right? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1952.48s)]
*  For, for the discourse, how far it's gone in different directions. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1954.52s)]
*  Should we pitch a documentary on, um, the kind of, uh, post-Coby pre-LeBron [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1958.48s)]

*  Well, I'm talking about like the young guys, Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1976.52s)]
*  There's like a Nick Young, D'Angelo Russell subplot in there. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1980.56s)]
*  Iggy Azalea is involved. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1984.08s)]
*  If I said, if I said her name right. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1985.7199999999998s)]
*  So you're saying the year before. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1987.8s)]
*  Larry Nance Jr. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1989.04s)]
*  Just like the, the youth movement that LeBron kind of came in and was like, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1990.2399999999998s)]
*  yeah, I'm publicly like, yeah, I'm curious. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1993.6s)]
*  Like these guys are all interesting. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1995.56s)]
*  And then was like, can we just trade all of them immediately? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1996.8s)]
*  Like one, but Kuzma, Kuzma is another one. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=1999.36s)]
*  They're all like these characters scattered across the league. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2001.44s)]
*  Now Lakers fans were so excited about that team. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2003.8s)]
*  Luke Walton was the coach and there was a moment, there were moments where it was [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2006.3600000000001s)]
*  like, maybe this could be a team. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2009.44s)]
*  Like maybe this could grow into something like a, like not a great team, but like a [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2011.48s)]
*  49 win team one year or something fun and homegrown. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2015.04s)]
*  And now they're just like a bomb went off and they're just scattered everywhere. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2018.16s)]
*  They had the number two pick. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2022.56s)]
*  Lonzo, Lonzo's in there. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2023.88s)]
*  I'm about to give you that, that Lonzo was on there. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2025.1200000000001s)]
*  Thomas Bryant. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2028.4s)]
*  He's in the playoffs right now. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2029.28s)]
*  KCP, Caruso, Jordan Clarkson, Channing Frye, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Kyle [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2030.52s)]
*  Kuzma, Brooke Lopez, Larry Nance, Gary Payton and Zubats all had minutes on the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2037.32s)]
*  2018 Lakers. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2045.48s)]
*  Now some of them left during the season with trades, but yeah, the Caruso piece [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2046.68s)]
*  of it, first of all, that he was in the G league nine years ago, that picture of [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2052.84s)]
*  him and Mark Dagnall is unbelievable. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2057.12s)]
*  Them and G league together. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2059.0s)]
*  It's just like an unbelievable photo. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2060.04s)]
*  But the fact that it just took this long for him to be fully appreciated, like [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2062.52s)]
*  he's being in these playoffs when it probably should have happened in 2020. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2068.2000000000003s)]
*  All the stuff he was doing then. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2072.0s)]
*  I still love that trade for both teams. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2073.6400000000003s)]
*  I think Giddy for Caruso is one of the most fun trades of the last five, six [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2075.44s)]
*  years, perfect trade for both teams. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2080.0s)]
*  All the stuff Caruso is doing on OKC is wasted on a 41 and 41 Bulls team. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2081.96s)]
*  Like this is where he should be. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2087.2400000000002s)]
*  Good trade. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2089.36s)]
*  If that like, no, I, I look, I, I didn't like it for the Bulls as much as you did, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2090.12s)]
*  but I also thought the Bulls got too much flack for that trade. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2094.76s)]
*  But Caruso is doing this on the highest level of professional basketball for the [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2097.96s)]
*  Bulls to end up in three years saying, Hey, that trade worked out just as well for us. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2104.88s)]
*  Giddy is going to have to do some of this stuff on like a really high level of [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2111.04s)]
*  basketball and not like it's cool that you average 28 and eight in March and [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2115.6s)]
*  April when half of the East is tanking. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2119.84s)]
*  And like, that's cool. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying it's meaningless. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2122.64s)]
*  Like he shot the three well this year, but it's gotta happen with [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2123.68s)]
*  some real stakes at some point. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2127.64s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2130.52s)]
*  And in the East, Hey Bill, like apologies to what, you know, the Boston thing, the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2131.4s)]
*  Milwaukee thing, like, Hey, it could, could be next year. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2136.52s)]
*  Bulls could be four or five series next year. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2138.56s)]
*  You know, who knows? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2141.4s)]
*  Well, that's the case. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2143.16s)]
*  Ben Thompson's coming up later. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  Cause I had to bring him on to yell at me about my Janus for Mowgli trade. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2145.7999999999997s)]
*  What was your take on that trade by the way? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2151.12s)]
*  Well, my first take was the same one that Bobby Marks had, which was, I'm pretty [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2152.8399999999997s)]
*  sure like this is way more complicated than that. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2158.64s)]
*  It was a theoretical. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2159.72s)]
*  And then my second trade was, I think Cleveland would just reflexively recoil [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2160.8399999999997s)]
*  from it because Mowgli is seven years or eight years younger or whatever it is. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2165.68s)]
*  Six and a half. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2170.16s)]
*  Six and a half. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2170.8799999999997s)]
*  And, and then my third thought was, should they, should they just [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2173.08s)]
*  reflexively recoil? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2176.44s)]
*  Like what is Mowgli's? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2177.6s)]
*  And I love Mowgli. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2178.8799999999997s)]
*  You and you and I both are super high on Mowgli. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2179.64s)]
*  It's probably going to make second team all NBA and kind of deservedly, I think. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2182.3199999999997s)]
*  And defensive player of the year. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2186.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2188.12s)]
*  I just, I just, but Janus is Janus and Mitchell, Mitchell Garland, Janus [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2190.44s)]
*  makes more sense than Shengun Thompson Janus or like, like, but, but I just [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2198.16s)]
*  think in the end, I'm a little bit more risk averse trading young for aging. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2206.6s)]
*  Um, it's the same reason I never got so excited about Durant coming to Boston. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2211.28s)]
*  Um, but I think, I think you, if their instinct, and I believe that it probably [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2215.6s)]
*  would be is to just like recoil in horror at the idea of trading Mowgli. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2221.4s)]
*  I think they need to at least sort of tamp that down and really think it [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2226.0s)]
*  through and what does it look like and what, what is the cost at least? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2228.92s)]
*  Boogie Cousins was on some show today saying that, uh, he thought Dallas should [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2232.16s)]
*  trade the Cooper flag pick for Durant. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2237.24s)]
*  Which I thought was bold. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2240.36s)]
*  Cause he said they're Dallas's windows right now. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2241.36s)]
*  Um, I feel like you're trying to bait me into, I'm not trying to bait you. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2245.6s)]
*  I'm just passing along information. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2248.52s)]
*  I will respectfully disagree with the Mark's cousins. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2250.32s)]
*  I don't think, I mean, I don't disagree. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2253.24s)]
*  He's right about the window and what Nico Harrison is probably said about [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2255.52s)]
*  the window, which is, which is why you aim it at Yanis and not Kevin Durant. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2258.8s)]
*  I think if you're going to, if you're going to do that, and I don't think [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2265.52s)]
*  they should do it either way. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2267.96s)]
*  I'm keeping flag. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2269.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2270.1200000000003s)]
*  Thanks anyway, everybody. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2270.52s)]

*  Thank you for all your offers. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2272.96s)]
*  I'll be keeping, I'll be keeping flag. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2274.32s)]
*  I guess. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2276.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2278.08s)]
*  Even Mowgli, I just flags still 18 and he's going to come in. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2278.2000000000003s)]
*  He's by the way yet you don't watch college basketball. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2282.64s)]
*  Um, he's going to be your favorite player. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2286.2s)]
*  I've watched my, I've done my YouTube and I've watched a couple of [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2289.7599999999998s)]
*  games because I got far in the tournament. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2292.2799999999997s)]
*  I enjoyed, I enjoyed a lot of boxes on the Zach scale. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2293.92s)]
*  I'll tell you that. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2298.04s)]
*  I enjoyed Duke's final four collapse against who did they, who did they collapse against? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2298.2s)]
*  Uh, Auburn Houston, one of those Houston. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2303.12s)]
*  Houston. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2305.68s)]
*  Great. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2305.96s)]
*  Great time. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2306.4s)]

*  Who did you have in Nick's Pacers? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2310.16s)]
*  Out of curiosity, Nixon seven, Nixon seven. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2311.64s)]
*  Are you, you have Pacers in four? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2315.52s)]
*  I assume. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2317.12s)]
*  No, I have either Pacers and six or Nixon seven. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2318.3599999999997s)]
*  I think it's one of those two outcomes. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2322.16s)]
*  I think any other, any other, well, any other pick than that, or I guess [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2323.64s)]
*  Pacers and seven, if he's thinking of winning on the road, any pick other [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2327.56s)]

*  Um, so I'll get there at five 20. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2350.64s)]
*  And don't stand next to wind horse. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2353.6s)]
*  He's just try to be like, or defend wind horse. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2355.6s)]
*  If anyone comes at him, like he's some, he's some karate. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2359.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm, that still made me mad. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2362.0s)]
*  Well, like, look, the Knicks, the Knicks fandom is awesome. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  And I'm, I'm like, go off. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2367.04s)]
*  It's been 25 years. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2369.12s)]
*  You want to flood the streets. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2370.36s)]
*  It's my favorite city in the world. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2371.44s)]
*  I lived there for 18 years. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2372.72s)]
*  You want to go crazy, but like someone, someone tweeted today, like, I don't [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2374.0s)]
*  know where the line is on this kind of stuff. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2377.84s)]
*  I think the line is like throwing stuff at people and shoving them and punching [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2379.68s)]
*  them. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2383.88s)]
*  There's a, it's pretty easy. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2384.24s)]
*  You can shout anything you want. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2385.36s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2386.88s)]
*  Like the stuff they did to the Pacers fan that Halliburton is flying out to [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2388.64s)]
*  Indiana, it's like that, that's a pretty, that's pretty clear line. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2392.64s)]
*  Like talk, talk, talk your shit, but like, don't hit people or throw stuff at them. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2395.64s)]
*  We know where the lines are. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2401.2s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2402.36s)]
*  There there's, we have some Knicks fans coming up after you. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2403.08s)]
*  There's a Jalen Brunson moment lurking right now that, you know, could take on [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  Joe Namath winning the third Superbowl ever proportions. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2411.48s)]
*  If, if he could actually pull it off. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2414.3199999999997s)]
*  He's eight minutes away. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2416.2s)]
*  Did you, did you ever see any version of this with the Knicks where they could [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2417.6s)]
*  actually like win the title? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2422.08s)]
*  They were pretty massive underdogs in that Celtic series. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2424.12s)]
*  Did you see it was like the fifth biggest upset of the 21st century in [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2426.8s)]
*  basketball, that series? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2430.56s)]
*  I mean, I've, I've always been higher on this Knicks team and even last season's [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2432.8s)]
*  Knicks team, I said was the biggest threat to the Celtics in the East. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2437.64s)]
*  Even if Philly were healthy, even if Milwaukee had been healthy, I would've [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2442.36s)]
*  thought that, um, I just thought Boston was a terrible matchup for them. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2445.6800000000003s)]
*  And I was shocked at how I think, you know, you put Tibbs on the hot seat [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2451.84s)]
*  before the playoffs and I understood why you did it. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2456.6800000000003s)]
*  I think he deserves a ton of credit for the job he's done this year on [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2459.32s)]
*  both ends of the floor and that series against, against Boston and the way. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2462.44s)]
*  That they stretch their, their scheme and their style into places that were [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2466.64s)]
*  not really familiar for them and part of their A game, I think it was an [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2471.04s)]
*  awesome performance top of the bottom, but I was shocked how easily they [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2474.4s)]
*  solved their Boston problem. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2477.36s)]
*  There's been some pretty crazy Celtics losses during this Tatum Brown era, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2479.96s)]
*  you know, like game seven, Cleveland 2018 when they missed, I think every [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2485.32s)]
*  three they took or it felt like it. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2490.64s)]
*  That was all gravy though. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2492.48s)]
*  Wasn't it for you? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2493.48s)]
*  I know, but it's just, it was one, I think, I think it's still one of the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2494.48s)]
*  four worst three point shooting performances in the history of the playoffs. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  That was back to back days with the, the Rockets missing 27. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2501.92s)]
*  That was another one of the worst ones ever. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2505.0s)]
*  Um, the 2022 that game four, when Steph just levitated above the game, the [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2507.36s)]
*  game seven 23 against Miami, when Tatum gets hurt a minute into the game. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2513.5600000000004s)]
*  Explainable though. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2518.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2519.2400000000002s)]
*  Explainable. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2519.6400000000003s)]
*  But I'm just saying the earlier losses in that series were worse. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2520.4s)]
*  They were comparable to games one and two against New York this year. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2525.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2528.92s)]
*  And then a game one and two, and I don't even know those games are just [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2529.6400000000003s)]
*  going to be lumped together in Celtics history. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2532.48s)]
*  It's not like, Oh, game two. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2535.2s)]
*  It's like, just those two together. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2536.68s)]
*  We'll be discussed. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2539.0s)]
*  Like just how do you lose two games a row at home to start a series down 20. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2540.12s)]
*  But I did feel, and I said this to you in the next segment, I really did feel [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2544.64s)]
*  like the Knicks played the best I've seen them play all year in the second half of [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2549.0s)]
*  game four and then all game six. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2553.36s)]
*  Like that, that was like the full potential of whatever this team is. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2554.92s)]
*  Plus they finally have a bench, even though it's two people. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2558.4s)]
*  Well, Bridges has, has become the player that they traded for in terms [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2560.64s)]
*  of just what he's doing. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2565.24s)]
*  McBride started making shots and Robinson being this healthy mobile monster, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2566.88s)]
*  like completely changes their team for 15 to 20 minutes a game. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2574.0s)]
*  It's those that those three variables alone are a big, big deal. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2577.7999999999997s)]
*  The other stuff is pretty consistent. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2581.2799999999997s)]
*  He was eye-openingly available for months during the season. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2582.04s)]
*  Robinson. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2585.44s)]
*  I'm kind of surprised nobody tried to scoop them up, but I think he, from an [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2586.6s)]
*  injury standpoint, I think, I think he just had this thing to him. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2589.36s)]
*  It's like, what am I, it's almost like where Rob Williams was after a while [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2593.88s)]
*  with the injuries where like, I just, is he going to play? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2597.0s)]
*  It's going to have any, how many games that are on my getting now? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2600.28s)]
*  It's only, it's only gotten worse for time Lord and the Blazers, uh, which [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2602.64s)]
*  is how those things typically go. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2608.2s)]
*  But yeah, long way to go. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2609.76s)]
*  Before we go, last question. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2611.28s)]
*  Cause I'm already in trade mode and draft mode as, cause now we only have one game [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2612.44s)]
*  a day, there's more stuff to think about. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2616.36s)]
*  Is there a team you feel like could be a holy shit trade team that [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2618.84s)]
*  we're not talking about enough yet? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2623.32s)]
*  It's funny because. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2625.48s)]
*  Is there a team you're on watch with out of the 30? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2626.44s)]
*  One of my plans for Thursday, my Thursday episode is I'm having another guest [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2629.64s)]
*  on where each going to pick our three. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2635.28s)]
*  Have we discussed this team enough off season team? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2637.2000000000003s)]
*  So this is like right up my. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2639.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2641.2400000000002s)]
*  So we'll tee that up for Thursday. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2641.84s)]
*  No, no, but I want to pick a team now. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2643.5200000000004s)]
*  Um, I mean, I feel, I don't want to pick an obvious one like Milwaukee or even [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2645.4s)]
*  Memphis we've talked about a lot. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2652.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm saying a little bit of a zag. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2653.32s)]
*  Uh, I've got my eyes on Atlanta and Sacramento. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2657.1600000000003s)]
*  They just feel like teams that are just, they just feel like teams that [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2663.36s)]
*  are just sizzling with, we both kind of like parts of where we're headed [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2668.08s)]
*  and especially Atlanta, but also we just like, we just fired our, like the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2674.2799999999997s)]
*  Hawks just fired their GM Landry fields and Sacramento had this turnover. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2678.44s)]
*  The DeRozan thing. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2682.92s)]
*  I just, both of them feel just like ripe for why, wait, why'd they do that? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2683.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2687.96s)]
*  Maybe I don't know. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2688.84s)]
*  Those are just two. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2689.72s)]
*  You got, you got one on the brain. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2690.6s)]
*  Give me, I know you got one on the brain, so let me, let me hear yours. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2692.16s)]
*  You're going to last. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2695.96s)]
*  It was Atlanta. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2697.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2698.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2700.2s)]
*  I had somebody ask me cause they've, he's heard some of the Yanis content [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2700.7999999999997s)]
*  we've done on different pods. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2705.96s)]
*  And he was like, why isn't Atlanta in the honest combo? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2708.3999999999996s)]
*  And I was like, what do you mean? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2711.24s)]
*  And he's like, well, Jaylen Johnson's awesome. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2712.2799999999997s)]
*  He's on their team. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2715.8399999999997s)]
*  He just got hurt. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2716.7999999999997s)]
*  Everyone forgets that he didn't play the second half of the year, but as a center [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2717.68s)]
*  piece of a trade, that's a really good centerpiece. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2720.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, they had their, they don't have their next couple of picks, but [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2725.08s)]
*  they have picks later and it would be pretty easy for them to put something [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2728.36s)]
*  together and basically turn it into train Yannis and keep Yannis in the East. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2732.88s)]
*  And I look, I wasn't saying it was going to happen, but he was, the question was, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2736.68s)]
*  why wouldn't Atlanta take a swing? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2742.16s)]
*  They don't have their picks anyway. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2743.84s)]
*  I didn't hate it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2748.24s)]
*  Um, I mean, I think if you're the bucks, it's gotta be, well, what else is there [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2749.2s)]
*  for us other than Jaylen Johnson, who I love and I believe is from Wisconsin. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2754.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2759.44s)]
*  But what's the way more in the trade than Jaylen Johnson? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2759.68s)]
*  So what's the way more, uh, because they owe some picks. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2762.44s)]
*  They have the Lakers pick and they have an extra pick from it's like the second [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2765.6s)]
*  best of New Orleans and Milwaukee and their own pick. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2769.32s)]
*  Um, they're missing their next couple, right? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2773.48s)]
*  Yeah, they have, they, they, they, the next three drafts, this one and the [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2777.4s)]
*  next two are controlled by the Spurs. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2781.52s)]
*  Uh, the next one's a swap with the Spurs, but they own 20, 29, 30, 31. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2783.64s)]
*  And then they have an extra bucks to New Orleans pick. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2789.16s)]
*  And they also have Reese's Shea. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2791.08s)]
*  If you wanted to get excited there, that feels like the rubber meets the road [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2792.2799999999997s)]
*  piece in any, in, in that discussion, you've been getting like a little [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2797.12s)]
*  bit off the ground is Reese's Shea. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2800.2s)]
*  And so if it's Jaylen Johnson, Reese's Shea, all their remaining picks. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2802.2s)]
*  I think Milwaukee has to sit down and think about it. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2806.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's an offer that teams can beat, but it's an offer that's like, you gotta [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2809.0s)]
*  beat it's not, it's not a nothing offer for sure. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2814.04s)]
*  I love Jaylen Johnson. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2816.68s)]
*  But I thought the same thing with Atlanta where it's, they had some upheaval. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2818.04s)]
*  They're kind of a no man's land. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2822.84s)]
*  Why not? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  If he's available, they've done weird shit before. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2826.8s)]
*  I'll tell you what mitigates against that though, is like how [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2829.28s)]
*  fucking bad the East is. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2831.96s)]
*  Like it's really easy to talk yourself into a world where Atlanta just stands, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2833.56s)]
*  Pat resigns, Laverte does nothing, all that interesting and is like, why can't [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2837.04s)]
*  we go 52 and 30 next year and be the third seed in the East and like still [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2841.24s)]
*  have some stuff to do. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2845.56s)]
*  Well, that's the case for Milwaukee. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2847.24s)]
*  To not do it, to do, to do, maybe we keep Yanis, maybe we're just a 50 win [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2850.64s)]
*  team by default in the East. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2855.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2857.56s)]
*  The difference is Yanis has tasted the championship and understands that [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2857.88s)]
*  the window is shrinking, the time window is shrinking. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2863.4s)]
*  And Trey has, and the Hawks have tasted the conference finals and everyone kind [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2866.68s)]
*  of, you know, wrote that one off and then there's just been swimming in the play [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2871.2799999999997s)]
*  end, just playing, playing, they should name the play end after the Hawks at [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2875.64s)]
*  this point, Hawks in the heat. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2880.04s)]
*  It's like a guaranteed play in game every year. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2881.12s)]
*  I wish Miami had one more guy because there's a bam in all your picks for [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2883.72s)]
*  Yanis type of framework that I think would work, but it just puts Yanis in [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2888.04s)]
*  the same situation as it now. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2892.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2894.08s)]
*  At least the Hawks one, at least you can say, well, he's going to another, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2894.72s)]
*  whatever you want to call Trey perennial all-star, semi perennial all-star, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2901.08s)]
*  couple time all-star and like, he fits well with Yanis. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2904.9199999999996s)]
*  Hero's like a one time all-star and everyone is like, really? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2907.48s)]
*  You know, I don't think, I mean, San Antonio has a ton of picks, but I don't [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2911.7599999999998s)]
*  think I said this to Ben later. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2918.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2919.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm stepping on a segment that's coming later, but I just don't, if I'm Yanis, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2920.08s)]
*  I'm not getting traded unless I'm guaranteed I'm going to be one of the [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2923.6s)]
*  best four teams, which is why going back to Cleveland, that's why the [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2926.12s)]
*  mobile thing made sense to me. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2929.92s)]
*  So it's like, if he gets traded there, Moby is the guy coming back. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2931.56s)]
*  I now know I'm the favorite in the East and I'm okay. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2935.08s)]
*  I'll prove in that trade at that point, but I guess we'll see. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2938.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2941.16s)]
*  Thursday, you're talking, uh, coming off the next game that you're going to go [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=2941.44s)]

*  And this series was magical and this week is, is extraordinary. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3103.44s)]
*  And I don't want to hear a damn word about guys over celebrating a second round [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3108.7200000000003s)]
*  victory because we haven't been there in a quarter century. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3113.16s)]
*  And that was an incredibly meaningful moment for the franchise, for the fan base [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3117.04s)]
*  and for a team that had lacked a signature moment all season. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3122.0s)]
*  And this series was clearly to this point, their signature moment. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3126.24s)]
*  So I'm just elated. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3129.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm thrilled and I'm super excited about this year's the Pacers. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3130.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll just add amen to all of that and kudos to you, Bill, because I think a lot of [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3134.24s)]
*  people would have said you wouldn't have two Knicks fans on. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3137.9199999999996s)]
*  And certainly some of my friends were like, is Bill going to have you on? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3141.48s)]
*  I'm like, look, you reached out to me. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3144.04s)]
*  I didn't reach out to you. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3145.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't like being that fan. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3146.96s)]
*  I don't like rubbing it in, but golly, I'm happy to be here. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3148.24s)]
*  I am delighted to be here. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3151.36s)]
*  That was one of the so I went to game six. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3152.92s)]
*  I was I was teetering, obviously the tickets and I bought my tickets. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3156.52s)]
*  No comps here. I'm not that kind of celebrity. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3160.52s)]
*  Certainly not on your level. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3162.8s)]
*  So I can't get in there with, you know, Chalamet and Bad Bunny. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3164.1600000000003s)]
*  But I remember exactly where I was in 1999 when we when we when we clenched at home [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3167.76s)]
*  to go to the NBA finals, when we beat the Indiana Pacers, I know exactly where I was [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3174.48s)]
*  in 2000 when Ewing dunked over morning the last trip to the Eastern Conference [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3179.08s)]
*  finals, and I said to myself, that kid, that 17 year old would have done anything. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3183.48s)]
*  He would have walked from his house in Montreal to Madison Square Garden to be here. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3187.2000000000003s)]
*  I have to figure out a way to be there. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3190.92s)]
*  And I'm so happy I got to go with my two kids because it was the greatest sporting [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3192.56s)]
*  event that I've ever been to in my life. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3195.56s)]
*  And I've been lucky to be to some. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3197.44s)]
*  It was a three hour party, Bill. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3199.04s)]
*  It was a three hour freaking party. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3200.88s)]
*  It was unlike anything because there was no tension. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3203.04s)]
*  There was no stress. We hadn't had one of those games yet in the playoffs. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3205.56s)]
*  Lord knows we didn't have a lot of those wins throughout the season. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3208.56s)]
*  And from the jump, you know, at one point, I think it was like seven five Boston. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3211.32s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3215.24s)]
*  You know, Jalen hit a couple of shots and that was it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3216.08s)]
*  It was a party. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3218.08s)]
*  And and and just I was able to look at everything. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3219.32s)]
*  And I told my kids this hasn't happened in 25 years to 13 and 11. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3221.84s)]
*  Oliver and Walter, I said, look at all this. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3226.04s)]
*  Take this all in. This doesn't happen. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3228.2s)]
*  Don't take this for granted. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3230.32s)]
*  And then we had to walk through the crowd, which, you know, I know everyone has their [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3231.64s)]
*  take on the crowd, but I thought everyone was well behaved. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3234.64s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3237.36s)]
*  We'll never forget it. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3238.12s)]
*  And I honestly wish that the Eastern Conference finals were starting on Saturday, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3239.24s)]
*  because I still need like five more days to revel in all the highlights, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3242.0s)]
*  all the videos about that win over the Celtics, because I don't want this feeling to go away. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3245.3199999999997s)]
*  Sean, you want the feeling to go away or are you ready to play some basketball? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3251.3599999999997s)]
*  I want to play. We're not done. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3255.2s)]
*  I think there's this is a team that has a really good chance to move on. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3256.7999999999997s)]
*  And frankly, we have revenge come due after last last series at the Pacers last year. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3260.7999999999997s)]
*  So I wanted Halliburton the whole time. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3266.16s)]
*  I'm glad it worked out. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3268.96s)]
*  I'm glad the Cavs once again were a paper tiger. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3269.88s)]
*  That's three years in a row. They've been a paper tiger. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3271.92s)]
*  And I think this team, I don't know if they're a team of destiny. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3274.12s)]
*  I have heard that said a few times. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3278.6s)]
*  I think the guys on group chat called them a team of destiny the other day. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3280.04s)]
*  But there is something different. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3283.52s)]
*  I never would have guessed that a team that is highlighted by Karl Anthony Towns, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3285.12s)]
*  a player I never understood or respected all the way up until last October. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3288.92s)]
*  But there is some sort of juju going on with them right now that is just thrilling. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3293.56s)]
*  And I'm the only time I'll probably disagree with Ariel this entire time. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3299.44s)]
*  This entire call is that I want the game to start tonight. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3303.36s)]
*  I wish they were playing right now. I'm ready. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3306.56s)]
*  Well, I know, Sean, you've come on sometimes and you've just laid some bombs [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3308.84s)]
*  and laid some wood on some rivals because you turned into a sports fan, Sean. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3312.76s)]
*  I hate I hate Karl Anthony Towns after that series. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3317.72s)]
*  And it's going to be tough for me to refer him for a while. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3320.7599999999998s)]
*  No rational reason for it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3323.6s)]
*  It's just he started playing well in game six and started puffing his chest out a little bit. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3325.52s)]
*  And the wheels have come off not just the Celtic series, but the season and probably the era. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3330.3599999999997s)]
*  And he became the target. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3335.72s)]
*  But that are you where do you where did you land on towns? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3337.64s)]
*  You're still trying to figure him out. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3340.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, no, I see fighter is he? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3342.52s)]
*  No, he's the man. He's the freaking man. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3344.2799999999997s)]
*  I hope they build a statue for him outside. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3345.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, my God. Karl Towns is the man. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3348.84s)]
*  I mean, look, look, everyone has their take on him. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3351.0s)]
*  Second trip to the conference finals and back to back seasons. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3354.84s)]
*  He beat Jokic last year, Western Conference finals. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3358.76s)]
*  Like you need to start respecting the team. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3360.6000000000004s)]
*  Jokic. Yeah, he was he was a big part of that in my opinion. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't remember that as the town series. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3365.52s)]
*  Oh, he was fantastic in that series. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3367.6000000000004s)]
*  But he must drive you crazy because he would drive me crazy if he was the center of my team. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3369.84s)]
*  I would go. I know what you're trying to do here. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3374.48s)]
*  There is nothing you can say about sports guy to get me to say anything negative about the New York Knicks right now. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3376.2s)]
*  I freaking love all of them. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3381.72s)]
*  I wish Jericho Simms and Matt Ryan and and and and and Jacob Toppin was back on the bench because I miss those guys as well. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3382.96s)]
*  That's how irrational all of this is. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3389.48s)]
*  I cannot I cannot tell you what it's like walking around. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3391.24s)]
*  So so right now we're near NYU and seeing everyone with their Knicks gear. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3395.92s)]
*  I was so tired of the LOL Knicks. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3399.96s)]
*  I was so tired of all the jokes of all the media outlets. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3402.3199999999997s)]
*  Always cracking jokes. I mean, they're still doing it. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3405.2s)]
*  TNT is still doing it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3407.08s)]
*  It's ridiculous how they're treating this team. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3408.64s)]
*  But I just love how the city how everyone is rallied around them. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3411.2799999999997s)]
*  Jalen is the I'm so lucky to grow up in an era where Jalen Brunson and Josh Allen are my two guys. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3414.44s)]
*  I mean, they are cut from the same cloth. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3422.04s)]
*  They're exactly the same. And that my kids can root for these guys the way he handled Friday. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3423.92s)]
*  He didn't even celebrate. Look at the look on his face. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3428.12s)]
*  He looked upset. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3430.24s)]
*  And I went back and looked at the post game press conference after Game 7, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3431.32s)]
*  when Tyrese Haliburton thought he was also cute walking in there with a t-shirt and the choking. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3434.6000000000004s)]
*  I can't wait for them to get revenge for that one because we have not forgotten. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3439.28s)]
*  And I went back and looked at his media availability with a broken hand. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3442.2000000000003s)]
*  He had the broken hand in that game. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3445.2000000000003s)]
*  And someone said to him, is this season a success? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3446.8s)]
*  And it was his version of job not finished. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3449.0400000000004s)]
*  And he's like, did we make it far? Did we win? No, this wasn't a success. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3450.76s)]
*  We're not here for any sort of like, you know, moral victory. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3454.52s)]
*  I love his mentality. I love everything about him. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3457.2000000000003s)]
*  And if you're still subscribing to the notion that he's too small or not the best guy on the court [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3459.56s)]
*  or all this nonsense, you know, you're missing the point and you're missing the fun. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3464.04s)]
*  This has been an unbelievable run. This is a likable team. This is a fun team. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3467.88s)]
*  Carl Towns completely dominated every big man that Boston threw his way from Porzingis to Horford [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3471.6s)]
*  to everyone in between. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3477.96s)]
*  Porzingis was dying of an illness. Horford's 39. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3479.04s)]
*  Cornet was a... I mean, we had Cornet before you guys had Cornet. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3482.92s)]
*  That was a great... And what about Mitchell Robinson in that one sequence? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3485.8s)]
*  That was the thing. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3488.8s)]
*  I mean, I will say Sean never gave up on Mitch Robb. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3489.92s)]
*  Good. You were waiting for those 15 minutes in the playoffs. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3493.6400000000003s)]
*  That was the weirdest thing about the series was by the end of the series, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3496.8s)]
*  all of a sudden, the Knicks had the seven man rotation that makes sense as like a four round playoff team. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3500.76s)]
*  Which I was not expecting. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3506.0800000000004s)]
*  If they get good deuce and they get good Mitch, they're an incredibly formidable team. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3507.32s)]
*  That legitimately feels like a championship team to me. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3511.76s)]
*  If it's only six guys, I get really tight. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3514.6400000000003s)]
*  And if one of those guys who's missing from that seven is Kat, like he was in game five, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3517.64s)]
*  then I'm really nervous that that was the best and the worst of this team that you saw in five and six. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3522.16s)]
*  When all cylinders were firing in six was the opposite of five. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3527.72s)]
*  So it's not... This is not the 93 Bulls. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3531.7599999999998s)]
*  That's not really what we're looking at here with these teams. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3536.36s)]
*  It's just their fears. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3538.68s)]
*  It feels like an opportunistic hole for them to slide into. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3540.6s)]
*  And like Ariel said, they have JB. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3544.72s)]
*  In my lifetime, never been an athlete who in the final minutes of a game, I trusted more in my life. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3547.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3553.88s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3555.32s)]
*  I mean, literally not close in my 43 years of watching sports. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3556.28s)]
*  Who is even... I mean, who's on the list? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3561.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you're a Bills fan, Ariel. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3562.48s)]
*  I'm a Jets fan. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3564.04s)]
*  So obviously, I don't have anybody to choose from there. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3564.76s)]
*  Well, I guess first three quarters, Josh Allen. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3567.1600000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3570.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm just lashing out. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3570.48s)]
*  No, that was just mean. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3571.8s)]
*  I don't know why I did that. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3573.7200000000003s)]
*  What's so great about this is like for the last 20 years, all the Boston teams have broken my heart. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3575.08s)]
*  You know, from the Bruins, Red Sox, Blue Jays now. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3580.36s)]
*  I'm a Blue Jays fan because my ex Bo's left. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3583.36s)]
*  Let's not get into that. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3585.12s)]
*  Nick Celtics, obviously, and of course, Patriots and both. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3586.2s)]
*  Everything's turning in my favor now, Bill. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3590.16s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3592.04s)]
*  We smoke you guys every year. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3593.2s)]
*  In fact, we let you guys beat us at the end of the season. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3594.84s)]
*  So you want to get the first pick. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3597.16s)]
*  We're favored in 13 games this year. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3599.32s)]
*  That McDermott switcheroo when we let you guys beat us was amazing. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3601.2s)]
*  And then what happened here? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3604.48s)]
*  You guys were so cocky going into this second round series. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3605.96s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3609.44s)]
*  We should have been. We were minus 800 favorites. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3610.16s)]
*  Why wouldn't we have been cocky? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3612.12s)]
*  You guys barely beat the Pistons. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3613.76s)]
*  You wrote them up. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3616.08s)]
*  We were up 3-1 and beat them in six. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3617.72s)]
*  Every fourth quarter was like was either or. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3619.32s)]
*  That's when they're at their most comfortable. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3623.04s)]
*  You know it now. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3624.36s)]
*  I know. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3625.12s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3625.48s)]
*  By the way, Bill, you're not subscribing to the theory that like we beat the Celtics because Tatum's injured, right? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3626.2s)]
*  Like we were winning that game. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3631.48s)]
*  We were winning game four. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3632.6s)]
*  Talk to my dad about this today. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3633.72s)]
*  We lost the series in the first two games and the fourth quarter you played in game four, which was incredible basketball. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3635.7599999999998s)]
*  We would have been down 3-1 in the series with the Porzingis who's like zombie Porzingis. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3644.2799999999997s)]
*  Howser, the sprained ankle. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3651.4s)]
*  Jalen Brown, we find out after he had this torn meniscus that they were kind enough never to tell us about for two months. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3653.4s)]
*  I don't think we could have won three in a row. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3659.6s)]
*  Looking back, I think it would have been a tall task. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3661.2799999999997s)]
*  You would have one game where you at least played one awesome half. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3663.56s)]
*  And I just don't. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3668.24s)]
*  I just don't think they would have won three straight with the team they had. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3669.08s)]
*  Now, before in March, I wouldn't have said that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3672.08s)]
*  Game six would have been really tough for you guys, even if Tatum was healthy, I think. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3676.16s)]
*  Game four was hard. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3679.52s)]
*  Tatum played one of the best games of his life and we were down nine when he got hurt. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3680.52s)]
*  Can I work up some Indiana animosity for you guys? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3685.84s)]
*  Oh, please. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3688.68s)]
*  Easy. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3689.36s)]
*  Not that hard. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3689.84s)]
*  Halliburton, you're already there. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3690.4s)]
*  It sounds like 10 out of 10 hatred. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3691.64s)]
*  Annoying. Annoying. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3693.96s)]
*  Yeah, fuck him. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3695.08s)]
*  Swarp. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3695.56s)]
*  Yeah, fuck him. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3696.2s)]
*  Reggie Miller doing the announcing. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3697.72s)]
*  Annoying. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3699.52s)]
*  That means you have to see the eight, nine seconds and the threes and the Spike Lee trash talk. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3700.2799999999997s)]
*  We're going to be force fed that. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3705.88s)]
*  Not looking forward to that. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3708.2799999999997s)]
*  Aaron Neesmith as a quote unquote Brunson stopper, just following him around every year and doing agitator stuff. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3709.68s)]
*  Like, where do you stand on him? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3717.68s)]
*  Did you say Brunson Fowler? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3719.92s)]
*  Brunson Fowler, some people say. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3722.08s)]
*  That's his role in this series, I think. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3723.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3726.7599999999998s)]
*  Neesmith's good. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3727.8399999999997s)]
*  Neesmith's good. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3729.48s)]
*  Nemheart's good as well. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3730.24s)]
*  My fellow Canadian hit that big shot in game three, which we would have won the series had that not happened. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3731.7599999999998s)]
*  They are a very good team and they're a very deep team. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3737.7599999999998s)]
*  Dare I say they're the best team that will play in the playoffs so far. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3740.2799999999997s)]
*  Sorry about the Celtics. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3743.4s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3745.44s)]
*  If you remove the poor Zyngus piece and Jaylen on... [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3745.8399999999997s)]
*  As they're currently constructed, as they're playing right now. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3749.08s)]
*  I'm not against that argument. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3751.4s)]
*  They're athletic. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3753.2400000000002s)]
*  They're like the 1993 Arkansas Razorbacks. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3754.04s)]
*  They play full-court press the entire game. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3758.44s)]
*  They don't let up. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3761.48s)]
*  TJ McConnell is a pest. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3762.92s)]
*  He's annoying. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3764.32s)]
*  He's a nat. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3764.88s)]
*  They've got a deep line. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3765.6s)]
*  But like I said, Siakam is really good, but we've got OG back. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3766.52s)]
*  Remember how OG played against Siakam in the first two games before he got hurt? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3769.6s)]
*  Turner's fine, but we've got Kat now who can compete with him. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3773.4s)]
*  Everyone likes to talk... [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3778.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, Maturin's good. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3779.64s)]
*  He didn't play last year. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3781.44s)]
*  He was hurt. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3782.44s)]
*  That's a nice addition. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3783.16s)]
*  But look how different our team is compared to last year. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3783.88s)]
*  And look how much healthier we are compared to last year. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3786.04s)]
*  You have a healthy seven. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3788.28s)]
*  A healthy, strong seven. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3789.84s)]
*  And look, Campaigne is there if we need him as well. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3791.92s)]
*  Our spark plug. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3794.64s)]
*  Don't forget about him. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3795.68s)]
*  I don't know of Campaigne. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3796.68s)]
*  I'm going to be counting on that one. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3797.64s)]
*  Plus you have more guys to hate, Sean. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3798.88s)]
*  You have TJ McConnell. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3800.92s)]
*  Hate him. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3803.56s)]
*  I'm sure you'll work a healthy amount of animosity toward him. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3804.08s)]
*  Hate him already. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3806.76s)]
*  Also a former sixer, which means I double despise him. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3807.44s)]
*  However, if TJ McConnell were a Nick, he would be an icon. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3810.16s)]
*  I just want to put that out there. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3813.64s)]
*  And then Maturin, who gets into it. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3814.72s)]
*  He's like those Detroit guys. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3818.64s)]
*  He'll get into it two, three times in a series. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3820.2s)]
*  He'll get some double techs. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3822.3199999999997s)]
*  He's fun to root against. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3823.52s)]
*  Rick Carlisle makes some annoying faces. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3825.12s)]
*  I feel like the animosity is going to be... [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3826.92s)]
*  Plus all the old 90s videos. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3828.68s)]
*  It just feels like this will be a really good old school. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3832.2s)]
*  A lot of hate on both sides. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3834.64s)]
*  I also think Indiana is a really hard place to play with the arena. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3836.3999999999996s)]
*  They have great fans. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3840.0s)]
*  The one thing, did you notice Rick Carlisle in his pre-series comments was trying to give [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3842.28s)]
*  a lot of credit to Precious Achua, I think, to kind of Jedi mind trick Tom Thibodeau into [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3847.16s)]
*  playing Precious. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3851.6s)]
*  I was like, I love Precious. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3852.44s)]
*  Precious plays so hard. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3853.7200000000003s)]
*  But I was like, why are we talking about Precious Achua in this press conference? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3854.8s)]
*  And Obi Toppin, old Nick coming back for... [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3858.36s)]
*  You know, he'll have one quarter or one game where he's just awesome. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3862.12s)]
*  And be like, oh, the Obi Toppin game. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3866.44s)]
*  I think Indiana has a slightly better team, but you have the Brunson piece. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3869.96s)]
*  And that's why I think this is... [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3874.56s)]
*  The line has shifted. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3876.16s)]
*  So now it's like Pacers minus, or Pacers plus 124, Knicks are favored. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3877.28s)]
*  But you're the healthiest you've been all year. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3883.88s)]
*  And I really, I said this to Rosillo on Sunday. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3885.4s)]
*  I think second half of game four and game six were the best I've seen those five guys [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3887.64s)]
*  play together. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3893.96s)]
*  And you really haven't had all five together for long stretches. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3894.96s)]
*  So that would be the case, combined with the energy in those Knicks games. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3898.72s)]
*  It's easy to hit those threes when you're playing Milwaukee without Dame, when you're [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3903.7999999999997s)]
*  playing Cleveland when everyone's terrified because they feel like the series is sliding. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3907.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a little different to do the pull up 25 footers in MSG when like Chalamet is stink [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3912.6s)]
*  eyeing you. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3919.12s)]
*  You know, all the celebs. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3920.68s)]
*  Sean, was there a celeb that you were like, come on, you haven't been to a game in 25 [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3921.9599999999996s)]
*  years. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3926.3999999999996s)]
*  How are you dining on this right now? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3927.3999999999996s)]
*  Anyone you want to call out or no? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3929.08s)]
*  You know, I'm in a passionate one-sided affair with Anne Hathaway and I love her to pieces. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3930.08s)]
*  And she's, you know, she's big Nick fan, but there's a little bit of confusion as to whether [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3934.8s)]
*  Philly or New York is the city sports city of choice for her. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3937.88s)]
*  You know, she was at that Eagle Superbowl. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3942.44s)]
*  Little bigamisty. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3944.64s)]
*  You know, her family's from Philly, but she roots for the Knicks. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3945.64s)]
*  But then there's a clip of her wearing Giants gear on Jimmy Fallon from eight years ago. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3949.4s)]
*  Little bit of confusion around Anne. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3955.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, I think she's a wonderful actress, but she's not really out here with like Tracy [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3957.1200000000003s)]
*  Morgan, Rock, you know, Stiller, the Sopranos guys. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3961.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3965.32s)]
*  Bobby Bacala. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3966.32s)]
*  Like those are really the icons. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3967.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3968.32s)]
*  Edie Falco, Bronson, Chloe Sevigny, Action Bronson. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3969.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3972.6800000000003s)]
*  There's I had some Sudeikis questions. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3973.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3975.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3976.32s)]
*  You stole mine, Bill. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3977.32s)]
*  I was waiting. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3978.32s)]
*  That one. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3979.32s)]
*  I don't want to be that fan. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3980.32s)]
*  I don't want to be that guy. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3981.32s)]
*  Where were you? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3982.32s)]
*  You know, when Lance Thomas was running up and down the corridor, Kylo Quinn, I don't [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3983.32s)]
*  want to be that guy. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3985.1200000000003s)]
*  But Sudeikis is a Nets guy. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3986.48s)]
*  He's all Nets. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3989.4s)]
*  He's in Nets, Liberties, Barclays. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3990.4s)]
*  He's in that whole universe. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3992.12s)]
*  I saw him on Friday and I was the one guy where I was like, nah, this one felt a little [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3993.12s)]
*  bit weird. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3998.62s)]
*  But again, I welcome all this whole thing that we can't celebrate or where were you [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=3999.62s)]
*  when all this nonsense, screw all that, be happy, enjoy the fun. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4003.72s)]
*  Sean's not like that at all. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4007.04s)]
*  Sean is not a welcome all. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4008.24s)]
*  He's like, where were you? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4009.64s)]
*  Where were you in round two when Roy Hibbert was killing Tyson Chandler? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4010.64s)]
*  Where were you? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4014.52s)]
*  I know where I was when that series was happening was I was in a bachelor party in Montreal [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4015.92s)]
*  off my tree and watching that game in tears. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4019.96s)]
*  I was so fucking mad and all the verticality. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4023.28s)]
*  I remember that era very well. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4025.6s)]
*  Where's Roy Hibbert now? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4027.04s)]
*  Nowhere to be seen. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4028.04s)]
*  Where's that style of basketball? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4029.04s)]
*  Dead. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4030.04s)]
*  What are we playing now? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4031.04s)]
*  Mitchell Robinson ball where we defend all five positions elegantly with grace and power [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4032.04s)]
*  until we break our ankle. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4036.68s)]
*  Ariel, where are you staying on Tibbs these days and what was your darkest moment with [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4038.12s)]
*  him the last couple of years? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4042.28s)]
*  Okay, so I'll tell you this again. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4045.36s)]
*  I know you're trying to get me to talk about you're trying to create some dissension when [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4048.16s)]
*  the vibes are immaculate right now. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4052.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4054.52s)]
*  At all. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4055.52s)]
*  This is dicey with us, though. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4056.52s)]
*  This is a little bit of a tricky thing. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4057.52s)]
*  Tibbs, you know, Ariel. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4058.52s)]
*  No, no, I'm cool with Tibbs ever since he was assistant coach with Jeff Nicks and Jeff [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4059.52s)]
*  Van Gundy under the great Pat Riley. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4064.04s)]
*  I'm okay with Tibbs. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4066.04s)]
*  Tibbs is my guy. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4067.04s)]
*  There was a game against the sound. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4068.04s)]
*  Sean says, okay, listen, we're different, different strokes for different folks. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4070.64s)]
*  There was a game in November, December at Chicago where it was very clear that Carl [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4074.92s)]
*  Townes was dealing with some sort of knee issue. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4080.2400000000002s)]
*  And at that point, it was the Derrick Rose game. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4083.1600000000003s)]
*  Derrick Rose had his little ceremony and so the Knicks were in town. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4085.44s)]
*  It was the second night of a back to back. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4088.4s)]
*  It was a Saturday and he kept Townes in and I thought Townes had a torn ACL. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4089.8s)]
*  I'm like, why is he in? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4094.2400000000002s)]
*  We're down by 15 points. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4095.4s)]
*  Why is he in? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4097.0s)]
*  That was the one time where I was like, I don't know if I could deal with this anymore. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4098.04s)]
*  But he's been phenomenal. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4101.24s)]
*  He's made the adjustments, made the adjustments from five to six in the last series. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4103.76s)]
*  That's my guy. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4108.76s)]
*  I ride with him. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4109.76s)]
*  I love the fact, I think it might have been on your show. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4110.76s)]
*  No, it was on New York, New York. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4113.56s)]
*  And I have to give a shout out to John. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4115.64s)]
*  He's been phenomenal. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4117.16s)]
*  His interview with Chris Childs that dropped I think this morning was so great and such [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4118.16s)]
*  a blast from the past to hear that unique voice of his. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4121.66s)]
*  I've loved his coverage. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4123.96s)]
*  So shout out to John. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4125.04s)]
*  He said that his vision of Tibbs was like after game six, he went to the back, opened [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4126.6s)]
*  a Diet Coke and just watched 100 hours of Pacers footage. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4132.92s)]
*  That's what I love about him. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4137.280000000001s)]
*  He's not out to drink wine. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4138.280000000001s)]
*  He's not out to go out for dinner. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4139.280000000001s)]
*  He's not out to hobnob. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4140.88s)]
*  He is a true basketball lifer. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4142.0s)]
*  He has no wife. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4143.360000000001s)]
*  He has no girlfriend. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4144.360000000001s)]
*  He has no kids. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4145.360000000001s)]
*  He has no nothing. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4146.360000000001s)]
*  I don't even know where he lives, the poor guy. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4147.360000000001s)]
*  He probably lives in Westchester. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4148.360000000001s)]
*  And so that's our guy. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4149.6s)]
*  We're riding with him. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4151.280000000001s)]
*  I love that he's still hanging on to the hair. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4153.240000000001s)]
*  The beard is a good addition to the look as well. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4155.160000000001s)]
*  You're not going to get me to say anything about Tibbs and what a story it would be for [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4157.72s)]
*  Tom Thibodeau to beat Minnesota. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4160.88s)]
*  People don't talk about that angle. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4162.68s)]
*  He was an assistant coach and then the head coach with Minnesota. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4165.360000000001s)]
*  What a story that would be if he plays Minnesota in the finals. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4168.2s)]
*  I'm getting ahead of myself here, but love Tibbs. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4172.08s)]
*  Can't wait for him to hold that trophy down the Canyon of Heroes in about a month and [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4174.8s)]
*  change. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4179.08s)]
*  Sean, who plays Tibbs in the movie? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4180.08s)]
*  Ooh, I mean, it would have been Gandolfini. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4182.08s)]
*  I mean, what an extraordinary Gandolfini part that would have been. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4185.76s)]
*  He's got the same bearing, burly guy, the deep voice, the thinning hair, you know, man on [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4189.28s)]
*  a mission. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4194.5199999999995s)]
*  Gandolfini would have played his starters too much, I feel like. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4195.5199999999995s)]
*  He played Paulie and Christopher a lot. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4197.36s)]
*  What about Paul Giamatti? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4200.36s)]
*  Oh, Giamatti would be good. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4201.36s)]
*  See the size? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4204.36s)]
*  I guess they'd have to cheat it. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4205.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he could put a prosthetic. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4207.24s)]
*  Giamatti would be a good Jeff Van Gundy, actually, now that I think about it. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4209.24s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4212.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4213.8s)]
*  I'm loving all of this. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4214.8s)]
*  Look how far we've come. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4216.2s)]
*  Now we're doing movies about the season. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4217.36s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4219.36s)]
*  Can we still buy the DVD? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4220.36s)]
*  Like, do they still do that at the end of the year when your team wins a championship? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4221.36s)]
*  Can I still get that? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4224.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4225.76s)]
*  What a sad question. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4226.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4227.76s)]
*  I've never experienced this in my life. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4228.76s)]
*  Bill's never won. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4229.76s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, because you have it. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4230.76s)]
*  What happens is you just spend a lot of money over the next 72 hours. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4232.92s)]
*  There's t-shirts and hats you need. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4236.72s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4238.72s)]
*  There's mugs. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4239.88s)]
*  There's just, and they keep coming and the hats keep changing and then the DVDs come [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4240.88s)]
*  out, so you got to get those. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4244.8s)]
*  It never ends. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4246.44s)]
*  But you had, I mean, Sean's kid is young. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4247.44s)]
*  You have kids now that are actually at the right age to experience, to just basically [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4250.28s)]
*  go completely apeshit if they actually kept going. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4255.28s)]
*  Bill, this has been a gift from God, honestly, because I fell in love. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4258.28s)]
*  The first team that I really, really loved, 1992 Knicks. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4262.799999999999s)]
*  91, I remember when they got swept by the Bulls in the first round, 3-0. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4266.2s)]
*  But the 92 Knicks, I remember vividly, my brothers were Bulls fans, so in 92 I'm 9, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4269.84s)]
*  and I remember sitting there, game seven, convincing myself that we were going to beat [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4276.24s)]
*  the Bulls on the road to the defending champions, and we got blown out. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4280.0s)]
*  I sat there, we were in a hotel room in Boston, and I was crying. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4283.32s)]
*  It was Memorial Day weekend, actually Victoria Day weekend, because we had off Canadian holiday. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4286.599999999999s)]
*  My sons are the same age now, 11 and 13. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4291.4s)]
*  To be able to experience this with them as a dad, and I know you and your dad have bonded [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4294.48s)]
*  over the Celtics. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4300.36s)]
*  It is great for myself personally. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4301.36s)]
*  I'm 42. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4304.04s)]
*  I've lived and died with this team, I adore them. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4305.5199999999995s)]
*  But to now see it through their eyes, and you know what's the best part? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4307.679999999999s)]
*  They calm me down. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4310.66s)]
*  Because as Sean said earlier, we're Cynics, we've been hurt. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4312.12s)]
*  They're completely positive. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4316.12s)]
*  They're like, oh yeah, we're going to beat these guys. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4317.12s)]
*  I have a video that I posted on my Instagram. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4320.04s)]
*  My son said before the game, we're winning by 30. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4321.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, are you insane? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4323.799999999999s)]
*  We don't win anything by 30. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4324.799999999999s)]
*  We never win a clincher at home by 30. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4326.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're just sort of like, they have this sort of like, blasé attitude about it all. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4328.959999999999s)]
*  They don't know any better. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4332.0s)]
*  They're idiots of aunts, for God's sakes. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4333.08s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing to witness that and to experience that with them. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4334.92s)]
*  And also to not have the hurt that we have. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4339.08s)]
*  They don't have any of this. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4341.8s)]
*  And so it gives me hope that perhaps this is truly a new era, at least in my life. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4342.8s)]
*  My buddy Sully's kids who were like early 2000s kids. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4347.32s)]
*  And that was kind of how they saw sports because they didn't have any of the DNA. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4351.92s)]
*  Because like when they were little, Brady won the first Super Bowl and then the Red [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4356.2s)]
*  Side. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4359.12s)]
*  And they just kind of assumed that's how it was. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4360.12s)]
*  And they're surrounded by all these tortured older people who are just waiting for the [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4361.36s)]
*  other shoe. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4365.639999999999s)]
*  And then then you have Sean, who's 40. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4366.639999999999s)]
*  How old are you now, Sean? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4369.639999999999s)]
*  43? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4370.639999999999s)]
*  Be 43 in July. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4371.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4372.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4373.639999999999s)]
*  What day? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4374.639999999999s)]
*  It hasn't been a great sports run. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4375.639999999999s)]
*  What day in July? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4376.639999999999s)]
*  I'm turning 43 in July too. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4377.639999999999s)]
*  We're like Kindred Spirits, you and I, Sean. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4378.639999999999s)]
*  26th, Ariel. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4380.4s)]
*  What day are you? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4381.4s)]
*  I'm July 8th. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4382.4s)]
*  But anyway, stop being such a cynic. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4383.4s)]
*  Enjoy it, man. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4384.4s)]
*  Have fun. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4385.4s)]
*  The thing with Sean, I've known Sean since 2012. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4386.4s)]
*  This is easily the best sports run he's been on. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4389.0s)]
*  Vsoto. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4392.24s)]
*  You got Ritter Baron Rogers, your least favorite New York athlete ever. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4393.36s)]
*  And then the Knicks run. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4396.48s)]
*  This is kind of weirdly the peak. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4397.48s)]
*  Speaking of John Dostremski, John and I were talking about this last week. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4402.2s)]
*  I feel like the franchises are in very good hands. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4404.8s)]
*  That's something that has defined my fandom is feeling like the franchises, you mentioned [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4408.12s)]
*  Lowell Knicks. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4413.44s)]
*  Lowell Mets isn't ongoing and Lowell Jets are ongoing bits for all the teams I care about. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4414.44s)]
*  They're often considered the laughingstocks of their respective leagues. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4419.4400000000005s)]
*  And somehow you remember this, Bill, when when the Knicks missed out on Kyrie and KD [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4423.12s)]
*  and they signed they signed Randall, I was apoplectic. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4429.84s)]
*  I was so upset, so furious. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4432.84s)]
*  I felt like it was the culmination of 20 years of failure for the franchise since that 2000 [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4435.12s)]
*  run that they made that Ariel was referring to earlier. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4440.12s)]
*  And I just could not take it. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4443.42s)]
*  I was so sick of Dolan. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4444.96s)]
*  I didn't understand. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4447.2s)]
*  The Timbs hire was a retread. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4448.679999999999s)]
*  And I was wrong, wrong, wrong. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4449.88s)]
*  I was wrong about everything. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4451.76s)]
*  I was wrong about every move that they made in the aftermath. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4453.08s)]
*  I was I actually liked the Brunson signing and did not have the like, I don't know about [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4455.5599999999995s)]
*  this contract attitude about it because I had just watched him mow down the jazz in [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4459.92s)]
*  that previous series in the Western Conference. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4463.76s)]
*  So I liked that. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4466.5s)]
*  I liked that his dad was basically like, we're bringing this kid here in two years and they [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4467.5s)]
*  had a plan. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4469.92s)]
*  But almost everything else that they did, I didn't really get it. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4471.0s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4474.679999999999s)]
*  I didn't understand it. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4475.679999999999s)]
*  I'm just a fan. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4476.679999999999s)]
*  I'm not an expert. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4478.16s)]
*  And to be proven wrong specifically in this way is the greatest feeling in the world because [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4479.16s)]
*  like even the bridges trade two months ago, maybe even two weeks ago, people were saying [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4485.240000000001s)]
*  this is a terrible trade. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4491.240000000001s)]
*  And then he did things in that Boston series that completely flipped the argument completely. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4493.4400000000005s)]
*  Fuck them picks is a motto in New York. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4498.52s)]
*  Now we don't care about that. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4501.16s)]
*  We are just delighted to have beaten the Celtics and to be going on to face the Pacers. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4502.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4506.719999999999s)]
*  You know, something you said, Aro was about the Knicks gear being everywhere. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4507.719999999999s)]
*  That was one of my favorite things about living in Boston when that would happen. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4511.88s)]
*  When there was some big series or some big game coming up and just the city would just [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4515.599999999999s)]
*  assume the identity of the franchise, which is really hard to do in New York, but was [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4520.48s)]
*  always why you knew Brooklyn was never going to really make it as the second alternative [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4525.44s)]
*  NBA team. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4530.12s)]
*  Because the case was as soon as the Knicks get their shit together, this is how it's [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4531.799999999999s)]
*  going to play out. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4535.76s)]
*  And it feels like it's played out even more than that. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4537.24s)]
*  Right. Like I got to say, like the outpouring has been just watching it from 3000 miles [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4539.320000000001s)]
*  away even feels bigger than I expected. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4544.68s)]
*  And I had high expectations. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4546.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. And that scene on Friday was absurd. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4548.84s)]
*  Like you walk out and there's a dude in flip flops sitting on top of a billboard. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4552.04s)]
*  I still have no idea how he got there. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4555.96s)]
*  But all of it was pretty well behaved. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4557.8s)]
*  You know, I know the one. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4559.84s)]
*  Look, the one guy in the Halliburton jersey. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4561.400000000001s)]
*  Like, what did you expect, buddy? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4563.6s)]
*  What did you expect? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4564.88s)]
*  Like he wanted that. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4565.88s)]
*  I didn't like the Wind Horse stuff. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4566.88s)]
*  I didn't like it at all. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4567.88s)]
*  Hated that. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4568.88s)]
*  Hated that. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4569.88s)]
*  Dispised that. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4570.88s)]
*  It's his job to give opinions. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4571.88s)]
*  Leave him the fuck alone. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4572.88s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4573.88s)]
*  But there were no cars being burned or anything like that. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4574.88s)]
*  No fights, at least that I saw. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4576.4800000000005s)]
*  And you know, a lot of those fans aren't as old as Sean and I. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4579.32s)]
*  A lot of those fans, you know, grew up with those pretty crappy teams. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4582.88s)]
*  Their one kind of high moment was 2013. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4586.6s)]
*  Hibbert blocks Mello at the at the rim, Linsanity, things like that. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4589.8s)]
*  And so I understand. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4593.12s)]
*  It's like this mixture of these like 25, 26 year old kids who are all experiencing this [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4595.62s)]
*  for the first time. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4600.66s)]
*  And then it's the, you know, the the Sean's and I of the world who are like, wow, this [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4601.94s)]
*  is just like the 90s. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4605.54s)]
*  And then I love meeting the old heads, right? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4607.0199999999995s)]
*  Like the dudes that were there in the 70s that were like, this is the second coming [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4609.46s)]
*  of Clyde. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4613.26s)]
*  It's so, I mean, I get chills just thinking about it. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4614.26s)]
*  It's those three chapters. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4616.3s)]
*  And obviously there's a lot of crap in between. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4618.0199999999995s)]
*  But to be in this city now, like when I was growing up, I said to myself, I need to make [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4620.0199999999995s)]
*  it to New York. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4624.62s)]
*  I need to live in New York. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4625.62s)]
*  I need to be able to go to work and be like one of those guys in the stands who's wearing [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4626.62s)]
*  the suit who just goes to the garden after work. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4629.82s)]
*  What a life. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4631.78s)]
*  You get to go to the garden after work and watch Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4632.78s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4635.5s)]
*  They suck for 20 years when I moved here. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4637.0s)]
*  So now finally we're here and experiencing the city walking up and down the street, seeing [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4639.26s)]
*  everyone wear their gear. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4643.22s)]
*  It's there's nothing like it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4644.86s)]
*  I've been here when the Yankees won. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4646.18s)]
*  I've been here when the Mets made it to the World Series. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4647.46s)]
*  Nothing even close to it. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4649.78s)]
*  Sean used to be like that. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4651.38s)]
*  When I made a move to L.A. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4652.38s)]
*  Come back. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4654.74s)]
*  Sean was like, someday I'll just live here. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4655.74s)]
*  I'll just leave work. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4657.34s)]
*  I'll go to a Knicks game. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4658.34s)]
*  I did see a screening after. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4660.34s)]
*  It'd be great. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4662.14s)]
*  I did used to live that life of going to Knicks games. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4663.14s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4665.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I can go back now that since I haven't gone back already. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4668.66s)]
*  Now I'm like I'm feeling superstitious. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4671.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4673.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, maybe. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4674.9800000000005s)]
*  Maybe that. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4675.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, like you have FOMO. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4676.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you feel like you need to be at one of these games? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4677.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4679.78s)]
*  I was in Oregon about as you know, at a golf resort about as far from the New York Knicks [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4680.94s)]
*  celebration universe as you could possibly be. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4685.94s)]
*  And I'm the lone guy sitting in a bar watching the game near tears. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4687.86s)]
*  Just like gobsmacked, gobsmacked by what I was watching. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4691.38s)]
*  Same thing after game two. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4694.66s)]
*  I'm sitting in my house in Los Angeles alone, hoping my child does not bother me, stunned [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4695.66s)]
*  by what was happening in game two. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4701.219999999999s)]
*  That was the most shocked I've been in a sporting event in 10 years. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4702.7s)]
*  So there's a part of me that thinks I just need to sit on my freaking couch and watch [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4706.36s)]
*  this series and not go anywhere. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4709.78s)]
*  But if they advance though, I don't know. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4711.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you'll keep me away. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4715.0599999999995s)]
*  Like I don't know how I could not go to the NBA finals. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4716.58s)]
*  It's hard for me to dream of that, but that would be genuinely exciting. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4718.98s)]
*  It's going to be I think it's already one of the harder tickets in the history of basketball. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4723.46s)]
*  And then there's the combo of Dolan just hoarding all the tickets and not giving any to the [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4728.86s)]
*  league. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4733.9s)]
*  And so it's just like, hey, I'm taking care of my people. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4734.9s)]
*  Steve strip has been coming here the whole time. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4738.3s)]
*  He's going to stay in his seat. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4740.900000000001s)]
*  Like, hey, he's weirdly loyal in a way that I love. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4742.14s)]
*  What was the darkest moment for you, Ariel? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4744.900000000001s)]
*  Sean said it was when they signed Randall was rock bottom for him. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4747.42s)]
*  What was rock bottom for you? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4751.3s)]
*  Well there are two moments where I really started to question myself. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4753.18s)]
*  The first was the night that Oakley got dragged out of the building that that that was dark. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4756.18s)]
*  That was really dark. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4760.700000000001s)]
*  I adore Charles Oakley and I will to the day I die. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4761.700000000001s)]
*  He meant so much to those teams and I still believe that his number should be retired. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4764.74s)]
*  And I think Starks, his number should be retired as well. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4768.179999999999s)]
*  That was very, very dark. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4772.179999999999s)]
*  And then the aftermath was a little weird. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4773.179999999999s)]
*  You remember the interviews and the media tour and all that. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4774.66s)]
*  As far as like actual basketball, the day they traded Porzingis, I felt like what the [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4777.78s)]
*  hell are we doing? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4784.0599999999995s)]
*  Because I believed in my soul. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4785.0599999999995s)]
*  I actually feel this way about Brunson and Josh as well. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4787.38s)]
*  I could see Chris Stapps Porzingis holding a trophy. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4790.54s)]
*  I could see that guy being a champion some way somehow. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4793.54s)]
*  And it ended up coming true. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4796.3s)]
*  He was just wearing a green jersey when he did it. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4797.54s)]
*  And I didn't understand why they gave up on him. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4800.5s)]
*  I would have much rather give up on Phil Jackson or anyone else. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4802.66s)]
*  And so to me on that day, I was like, I don't know if I could do this. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4807.06s)]
*  When they didn't get KD and Kyrie, I was bummed. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4810.22s)]
*  But you know, KD was coming off the Achilles. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4812.5s)]
*  I've never been a big Kyrie fan. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4814.82s)]
*  I was definitely bummed, but I didn't feel like this was the end. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4816.5s)]
*  I felt like it was a gamble, quite honestly. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4819.98s)]
*  I didn't hate the Randall signing as well. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4823.0599999999995s)]
*  So those two were really, really dark because Oakley has meant so much to this team and [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4825.0599999999995s)]
*  to this city, and he didn't deserve that. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4829.66s)]
*  And it's so great seeing all the legends. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4831.74s)]
*  I miss seeing him. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4834.179999999999s)]
*  One of the great stories is seeing Ewing back in the fold here. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4835.54s)]
*  Like those videos of Ewing rocking up with the guys off the team bus into the locker [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4838.58s)]
*  room, wearing his gear, looking like he could give you a solid 20 minutes, you know, maybe [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4842.98s)]
*  10 and 10. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4847.339999999999s)]
*  Like he looks ready to go. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4848.339999999999s)]
*  He's slimmed down. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4849.139999999999s)]
*  I love that content. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4850.139999999999s)]
*  I can't get enough of it. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4850.98s)]
*  So it's nice to see all the legends, but we're missing one big guy. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4852.82s)]
*  And I pray that they're able to figure it out. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4855.5s)]
*  A friend of mine, pretty connected, had good seats for one of the games, game four, game [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4859.139999999999s)]
*  six. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4864.179999999999s)]
*  And sitting next to him was one of the, it was like Starks, one of those guys. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4865.38s)]
*  It's like, oh my God. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4869.099999999999s)]
*  And then he just happened to be in the area where like six of them were. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4870.54s)]
*  And it was like his young adult came to life and he was just like, almost having a seizure. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4874.82s)]
*  It is crazy how many. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4880.259999999999s)]
*  To me, like, look, I'm not a Knicks fan. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4882.54s)]
*  I'm obviously a giant basketball fan. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4885.02s)]
*  When we start moving into the Marbury era, that gets a little where it's like, hey, look, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4887.66s)]
*  there's Marbury. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4892.5s)]
*  It's like nothing good happened with Marbury the entire time he was with the Knicks. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4893.18s)]
*  Like there's some of those, but I think. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4896.7s)]
*  He's a son of New York, though. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4899.54s)]
*  Like there's a slightly more complicated thing there. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4900.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4902.9800000000005s)]
*  I just think the Celtics version of when we bring the greats back is a little, you [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4903.42s)]
*  usually have to have had one good thing happen. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4908.42s)]
*  18 to two. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4910.78s)]
*  By the way, you know, it's my like totally irrational dark day when we traded Machak [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4912.06s)]
*  Lampi to the sons for Spon Marbury. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4915.860000000001s)]
*  I was convinced that Lampi was going to be the guy. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4918.06s)]
*  He was our Polish prince. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4920.06s)]
*  I thought that he would be like our European stud. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4921.22s)]
*  And also when they got rid of. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4924.06s)]
*  There was something about him that I just love. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4926.580000000001s)]
*  And also Billy Hernan Gomez. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4927.9400000000005s)]
*  I thought that he was going to be something special for us as well. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4929.860000000001s)]
*  Like there was all these guys and that's part of the fun, right? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4932.18s)]
*  Going through these these stories and seeing all these Alexi Sved, like those guys, like [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4934.38s)]
*  that's what makes all this worth it. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4939.22s)]
*  Remember him? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4941.46s)]
*  He had a great run. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4942.259999999999s)]
*  Before we go, since I have both of you here. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4943.42s)]
*  There's a UFC movie coming out with The Rock that The Rock is allegedly a real [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4946.82s)]
*  Oscars contender for. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4952.66s)]
*  So Sean follows this stuff obsessively. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4954.299999999999s)]
*  And then this is Ariel's domain. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4957.219999999999s)]
*  Ariel, what have you heard? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4960.42s)]
*  OK. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4961.94s)]
*  What have I heard about the film? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4963.54s)]
*  The film is called The Smashing Machine. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4964.58s)]
*  It's based on, in my opinion, one of, if not the best combat sports documentaries of all time. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4966.62s)]
*  It's about a guy named Mark Kerr who had a crazy life. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4973.0599999999995s)]
*  Had a run in the UFC, but was really a star in Pride, which was an organization in Japan [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4976.78s)]
*  when Pride was the number one MMA organization in the world in the early 2000s. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4981.94s)]
*  And HBO, it's 2000, 2001 that this film came out. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4985.7s)]
*  Put on this documentary when, you know, remember back then, 2000, 2001, like no one was airing [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4990.14s)]
*  anything about MMA. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4994.34s)]
*  It was as far away from mainstream as possible. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4995.3s)]
*  And there's drugs and there's all kinds of stuff involved. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=4998.1s)]
*  And so the film is based on, you know, The Rock movie is based on that documentary. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5000.26s)]
*  So my hopes are very, very high just given the subject matter. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5004.58s)]
*  And I think initially people thought, hmm, are they going to be able to pull it off? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5008.26s)]
*  Is it going to be too high? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5011.78s)]
*  Is The Rock the right guy for all of this? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5013.62s)]
*  But once that trailer came out, I mean, I could speak for the MMA community. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5015.62s)]
*  Everyone was like, holy crap, this looks a legit. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5019.38s)]
*  It looks spot on. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5022.820000000001s)]
*  And it looks like they were able to capture the essence of that time period. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5024.26s)]
*  So, you know, they got guys like Alexander Usyk in there, Ryan Bader playing Mark Coleman. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5027.46s)]
*  Like I saw some of the footage and I mean, just from the three minute clip, I think they [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5033.14s)]
*  kind of nailed it. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5038.9800000000005s)]
*  I can't wait for this. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5039.62s)]
*  And you know this as well as anyone, but like there haven't been a lot of great MMA movies. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5040.5s)]
*  You know, we got Here Comes the Boom and Warrior. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5044.34s)]
*  It's the best one, I think. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5047.3s)]
*  Not a lot of them for some bizarre reason. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5048.9800000000005s)]
*  Obviously, you know, not as old as boxing. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5050.74s)]
*  But this could be it. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5052.98s)]
*  And perhaps this is the one that gets The Rock's movie career back on track, which I [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5054.74s)]
*  would love. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5058.099999999999s)]
*  So very excited. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5058.419999999999s)]
*  What's funny is they've been cranking out boxing movies pretty consistently for 100 [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5058.9s)]
*  years. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5066.0199999999995s)]
*  And just when you think like they've made enough boxing movies, then another one comes [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5066.66s)]
*  out, another one comes out. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5070.259999999999s)]
*  I thought that the woman about the female boxer, Chrissa Shields, thought that was [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5071.459999999999s)]
*  actually good. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5075.62s)]
*  The fire inside, yeah. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5076.099999999999s)]
*  The fire inside, yeah. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5076.9s)]
*  But you would have thought there would be more MMA in there. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5077.219999999999s)]
*  Just hasn't. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5080.66s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5081.299999999999s)]
*  So Sean, we did, you've talked about this on your pod a bunch. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5081.54s)]
*  We did a video on Ringer Movies about is it ever going to happen for The Rock? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5085.3s)]
*  Why is the movie star thing, has the ship sailed? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5091.86s)]
*  And then you see this trailer and it's like, okay, maybe we're back in. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5097.46s)]
*  To me, it was a mystery and now it's just a frustration that it has taken this long. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5102.18s)]
*  For two reasons. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5109.46s)]
*  One, I know you both know this, never seen anybody better on the mic short of Rick [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5110.18s)]
*  Flair in pro wrestling. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5113.94s)]
*  I mean, he was just in the prime of the attitude era. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5115.3s)]
*  And even in the second half, moving into the scene era, he was unbelievable at just [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5120.1s)]
*  selling anything. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5125.78s)]
*  And a huge part of being a movie star is selling the absurd, is selling the [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5127.38s)]
*  ridiculous setup. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5131.94s)]
*  So on that face, he should have been incredible. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5133.3s)]
*  And then secondarily, I always tell the story. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5135.78s)]
*  I went to the premiere of Hobbs and Shaw, whatever that was seven, eight years ago. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5137.46s)]
*  And it was at the Kodak theater in Hollywood and someone's soda rolled down the aisle and [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5141.06s)]
*  smashed into a chair, which then triggered a fuse explosion and the lights turned off [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5149.86s)]
*  in the theater. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5157.06s)]
*  So there was a delay before the film started and to stem the tide and keep the people in [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5158.34s)]
*  their seats. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5164.58s)]
*  Dwayne came out and just riffed for 25 minutes, just talked, made tons of jokes at Jason [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5165.22s)]
*  Statham's expense, just sold, sold, sold for 25 minutes in front of 2000 people waiting [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5172.9s)]
*  for this movie to start. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5178.0199999999995s)]
*  And he was magnetic. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5179.38s)]
*  And then I see the movies that he makes and I'm like, who told him to do this? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5181.38s)]
*  Why is he in Jungle Cruise? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5185.86s)]
*  Why did Black Adam happen? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5187.86s)]
*  I don't understand because you see him to communicate and you can tell just what a [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5189.22s)]
*  vibrant, fascinating, funny, self-aware person he is. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5192.74s)]
*  And he just hasn't picked good collaborators. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5196.34s)]
*  And the end note on this conversation is the person who directed The Smashing Machine is [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5198.26s)]
*  Benny Safdie, a Knicks fan and New Yorker who understands the peculiarity of strange [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5202.82s)]
*  characters. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5208.74s)]
*  And Mark Kerr is an interesting guy and The Smashing Machine documentary is not a cookie [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5209.94s)]
*  cutter portrait of a rise to greatness. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5215.86s)]
*  It's much more complex than that. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5219.0599999999995s)]
*  So I think if you care about sports movies, if you care about The Rock, if you're interested [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5220.66s)]
*  in combat sports, it feels like it's tailor-made for an incredible moment for him and for [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5224.58s)]
*  movies. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5231.7s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5232.18s)]
*  I care about all three of those things. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5232.5s)]
*  The problem is with UFC and MMA in general, it's such a passionate, loud audience. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5234.74s)]
*  But then I always wonder like how big is the actual audience, right? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5241.139999999999s)]
*  Like I know Netflix is thinking about, you know, it's been reported. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5245.3s)]
*  Do they want to get in and grab some pay-per-views? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5249.3s)]
*  Like I wonder if Netflix got some pay-per-views, Ariel, and it's just going to all these different [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5251.46s)]
*  countries. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5258.820000000001s)]
*  Does that make MMA bigger or did we hit the ceiling already? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5259.38s)]
*  Like is there new people to find? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5262.820000000001s)]
*  Because I think this ties into the movie. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5264.5s)]
*  How much audience is left that's out there? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5266.66s)]
*  Oh, there's a ton left. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5269.3s)]
*  I mean, we're seeing a guy named Ilya Tuporiya who has just opened this whole Spanish region [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5270.66s)]
*  that was non-existent and they're saying that he can headline the Bernabeu, which is where [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5276.42s)]
*  Real Madrid play and that's like 80,000 people. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5280.82s)]
*  That wasn't an option, you know, two, three years ago. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5283.22s)]
*  And so when guys start to pop up in these different countries and then, you know, people [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5286.1s)]
*  will emerge here and it's very cyclical. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5289.9400000000005s)]
*  There's high moments, there's down moments, there's stars, you know, the whole Russian [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5291.86s)]
*  region. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5295.62s)]
*  That wasn't really a thing five, six years ago. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5295.9400000000005s)]
*  And now you have all these guys who are... [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5297.78s)]
*  France came on too. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5299.06s)]
*  That was another one. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5300.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5301.22s)]
*  So, you know, Brazil, France has been incredible as far as MMA and pro wrestling. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5301.54s)]
*  So, no, they have not hit the ceiling. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5306.5s)]
*  As you know, combat sports, like I said, there are peaks and valleys and everyone likes to [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5310.34s)]
*  say... [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5315.06s)]
*  You know, I even said, I said the MMA business is in a recession, but I didn't say the UFC [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5315.46s)]
*  is in a recession. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5320.26s)]
*  I said the MMA business, meaning there's just really one dominant league. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5320.9800000000005s)]
*  There are no prides anymore. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5324.900000000001s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5326.42s)]
*  We don't have it. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5327.9400000000005s)]
*  I think we've talked about this in the past. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5328.58s)]
*  There is no AEW to UFC's WWE right now. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5330.0199999999995s)]
*  Not even close. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5333.7s)]
*  Like not even close. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5334.82s)]
*  So the UFC is doing just fine. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5335.62s)]
*  They're going to get a multi-billion dollar deal. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5336.9s)]
*  Whenever they sign their new deal, ESPN will probably still be involved in some way, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5339.299999999999s)]
*  shape or form, and it will continue to get bigger. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5342.82s)]
*  But as you know, it only goes as far as like who the stars are, right? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5345.46s)]
*  The UFC always wants to position itself as the biggest star, the UFC. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5349.94s)]
*  That's the brand and it's doing great. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5354.339999999999s)]
*  But then when you get those superstars that come along and they will continue to come [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5356.179999999999s)]
*  along, it goes to a whole other level and they're experiencing that with [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5359.14s)]
*  Deporia who's headlining on June 28th and they'll experience it with others as well. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5361.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5365.9400000000005s)]
*  He took the Pereira side. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5366.18s)]
*  I'm still still bitter. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5367.860000000001s)]
*  My guy Pereira. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5369.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5370.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5371.9400000000005s)]
*  Cause you think Sean, with the MMA audience, that's kind of dormant for a movie. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5372.18s)]
*  They really hit for the rock. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5377.46s)]
*  You've got to hit different countries. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5378.9800000000005s)]
*  He hits different countries anyway. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5381.3s)]
*  And if that audience is there, so this could be the rare combo of like an awards contender [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5382.740000000001s)]
*  that actually makes real money. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5386.9s)]
*  That's not a franchise. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5389.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5391.0599999999995s)]
*  It's coming out in the first week of April, which, or excuse me, the first week of October, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5391.62s)]
*  which is historically a kind of a circling the square for box office and awards consideration. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5394.82s)]
*  That's like the same weekend that a movie like The Star is Born was released. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5401.299999999999s)]
*  So I think they're looking for a kind of like commercial critically acclaimed movie, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5404.099999999999s)]
*  which is, as we know, like one of the hardest things to do in movies right now. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5408.98s)]
*  And we'll see. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5412.0199999999995s)]
*  My advice to him would be don't over-promote it. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5414.66s)]
*  Don't feel like you need to be all over the place with it. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5418.259999999999s)]
*  Like be a little discreet because I don't feel like that over-promotion stuff works [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5420.82s)]
*  with the awards and this is like his one chance, but I hope, I hope we get more [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5424.9s)]
*  MMA stuff just in general. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5430.179999999999s)]
*  I'm always amazed that that's not a lane for movies right now. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5431.7s)]
*  It would seem like that would be even easier to do than boxing. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5435.78s)]
*  You know, you guys are the experts when it comes to this, but actually just today [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5439.78s)]
*  on my show, I spoke to Ryan Bader, who's playing Mark Coleman in the movie. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5443.54s)]
*  And Mark Coleman was Mark Kerr's best friend. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5448.02s)]
*  Looks just like him from the photos that I saw. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5451.06s)]
*  And I actually asked him, like that was his first movie. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5453.3s)]
*  He's a former UFC title contender, Bellator champion. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5456.02s)]
*  What was it like, you know, just being on set, sitting around the multiple takes? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5459.06s)]
*  Did you drive yourself crazy? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5463.22s)]
*  And he said, and again, this is not my world, but he said, actually, Benny's philosophy is [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5464.5s)]
*  don't do too many takes, like three, four takes. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5470.18s)]
*  If the Rock's mouthpiece came out, like keep it. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5473.139999999999s)]
*  He wants it to be raw. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5475.299999999999s)]
*  He kind of shot it like a documentary, which actually made me even more interested in seeing [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5476.259999999999s)]
*  how it all looks. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5481.139999999999s)]
*  So I don't know if that's unique. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5481.86s)]
*  I don't know if that's something different if certain guys do that. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5483.0599999999995s)]
*  But I thought that was interesting. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5486.259999999999s)]
*  By the way, shout out to Bill for completely changing the subject and not maybe focusing [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5487.78s)]
*  on Miles McBride's huge block. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5491.54s)]
*  And that's, you remember that chase down in game six when he blocked and then they came [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5493.62s)]
*  back with the Anwanja. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5497.219999999999s)]
*  Like, I love the way you just transitioned away. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5498.339999999999s)]
*  That was a big time block. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5500.42s)]
*  You have to admit. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5501.46s)]
*  I had to get 10 minutes of UFC with you when you're here. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5503.06s)]
*  I mean, I just thought we'd talk more. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5506.1s)]
*  Like, do we want to talk about how Missoula was exposed? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5507.700000000001s)]
*  Like, he doesn't really, you know. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5510.900000000001s)]
*  Settle down. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5513.3s)]
*  We won the title last year. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5513.9400000000005s)]
*  That was fine. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5515.780000000001s)]
*  That was all Yudoka's doing. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5516.5s)]
*  That was Yudoka. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5517.14s)]
*  I mean, he just seen hair to the teeth. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5517.700000000001s)]
*  Yudoka. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5519.38s)]
*  Can he be a little nicer to the media? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5520.18s)]
*  Like the shtick of being like grumpy is wearing a little thin. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5523.06s)]
*  I love just my two cents. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5527.38s)]
*  But Luke Cornett had a great game play. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5529.38s)]
*  Way in a Belichick's girlfriend now. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5530.58s)]
*  What other hits do you want to take? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5531.86s)]
*  Cornett had a great game five. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5533.78s)]
*  I mean, like, are we raising a banner for the game five or what? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5535.38s)]
*  What's the deal? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5538.42s)]
*  Telling our grandkids about it. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5538.9800000000005s)]
*  We won the title last year. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5539.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm in a five-year grace period. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5541.06s)]
*  All right, guys. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5543.9400000000005s)]
*  Good luck against the Pacers in round three. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5545.22s)]
*  I'm happy for both of you. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5548.66s)]
*  Wait, I was going to say, you're picking against us or what? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5549.9400000000005s)]
*  I hear you and Rosillo and you guys just spent all this time hyping the Pacers and kind of [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5551.7s)]
*  not negging the Knicks, but just not addressing the Knicks. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5557.62s)]
*  I think it's either Pacers in six or Knicks in seven. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5560.66s)]
*  I don't think the Pacers can win a game seven against a healthy Knicks team with [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5563.3s)]
*  the way the arena will be. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5567.38s)]
*  But we'll see. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5569.46s)]
*  My fear for you guys, there's a couple health guys I do not trust on your team [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5571.14s)]
*  who have stayed reasonably healthy so far. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5577.62s)]
*  Townsend and Ananobe. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5581.38s)]
*  Not to mention Mitchell Robinson, who every game you get out of him [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5582.900000000001s)]
*  is, it feels like a miracle. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5586.1s)]
*  So I just, you know, these playoff games are hard. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5588.18s)]
*  They're intense. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5590.5s)]
*  That's, I feel like the Pacers are probably a little more durable [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5591.9400000000005s)]
*  when this thing gets really physical than maybe the Knicks are, but who knows? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5596.02s)]
*  You might have the team of destiny thing and the Brunson thing is unbelievable. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5599.3s)]
*  When he rooting against that guy in a playoff series in the fourth quarters, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5603.3s)]
*  I just felt like he was going to score on us. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5607.700000000001s)]
*  And we had like, we had a holiday on him. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5609.700000000001s)]
*  We were throwing Tatum and Brown on him. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5611.54s)]
*  And I just felt like he was going to get, when he shook holiday, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5613.14s)]
*  that one shot, I can't remember if it was game one or game two, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5616.18s)]
*  coming off the inbounds with like 10 seconds left. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5620.02s)]
*  Just shook him off and got the shot he wanted. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5622.900000000001s)]
*  Like that was crazy. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5626.02s)]
*  Nobody does that to Drew Holiday. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5626.740000000001s)]
*  So can I tell you something? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5628.34s)]
*  I watched the four minute cut down recap of game four, like 11 times in a row that night, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5629.860000000001s)]
*  just to watch him absolutely cook white. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5635.9400000000005s)]
*  He cooked white all day long. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5638.34s)]
*  That was astonishing to watch. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5641.22s)]
*  Whether he can do that to Aaron fucking Neesmith, we're about to find out. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5643.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5646.58s)]
*  Oh, I'm so worried about Neesmith. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5647.22s)]
*  He just dealt with Thompson, Brown, Tatum, Derek White. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5648.900000000001s)]
*  I like this, the cocky. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5653.46s)]
*  I'm so worried about Neesmith. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5655.38s)]
*  Don't get, just keep it in check. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5656.82s)]
*  What about Neesmith? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5658.58s)]
*  What about TJ McConnell? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5659.62s)]
*  Picking him up 94 feet. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5661.14s)]
*  The horror. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5664.02s)]
*  There is going to be some 94 feet. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5664.5s)]
*  They're going to try to put some miles on your guy. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5666.02s)]
*  They're going to try to wear him down. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5668.26s)]
*  I'm cool with it. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5670.58s)]
*  Good luck. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5671.14s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5671.7s)]
*  I'm glad you were finally able to come on under happy circumstances. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5672.5s)]
*  It was a pleasure to see both. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5675.54s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5677.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5678.02s)]
*  All right. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5679.38s)]
*  He's been on this podcast many times. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5679.7s)]
*  You know him from the Strutechary newsletter, one of the pioneers. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5681.46s)]
*  He's also a giant Bucks fan. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5685.7s)]
*  His name is Ben Thompson. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5687.22s)]
*  And if I'm going to make fake Yanis trades, really is that any- [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5689.22s)]
*  No, atrocious fake Yanis trades. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5693.86s)]
*  I just seriously consider, is it worth coming on a podcast with someone that [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5695.62s)]
*  apparently seriously proposed Yanis for Evan Mobley? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5700.0199999999995s)]
*  Are you joking? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5702.66s)]
*  Can I explain the thought process behind it? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5704.66s)]
*  And then you can tell me how offended you should be. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5707.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be hard to decrease the level, but sure. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5710.66s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5712.74s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't think you should trade Yanis, which I said in the pod. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5713.62s)]
*  I think you should keep Yanis because especially with the way the East is going. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5717.86s)]
*  Oh, it's so bad. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5721.78s)]
*  It's so bad. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5722.82s)]
*  But- [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5724.58s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5724.74s)]
*  If you're going to trade them, you can't do the Kevin Durand, get a bunch of picks back [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5726.0199999999995s)]
*  and go for the future because you don't have any of your own picks. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5731.94s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5734.9s)]
*  So I need to get a good player back. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5735.78s)]
*  And I'm shopping on that Evan Mobley level looking at 80 cents on the dollar. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5739.22s)]
*  If I'm trading Yanis, that's what you have to do. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5744.9s)]
*  I get the overall thought process. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5747.86s)]
*  There's a few problems here. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5749.62s)]
*  So number one, this whole situation sucks. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5751.06s)]
*  Just to be clear, there's a real trade off. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5753.54s)]
*  What's good for the Bucks is good for Yanis. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5757.38s)]
*  I mean, the reality is if I'm going to take all emotion out of it, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5758.9s)]
*  it's probably best for both parties to move on. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5762.66s)]
*  I mean, the Bucks are, it's really rough. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5766.82s)]
*  I mean, we were starting, the fan base was happy [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5769.22s)]
*  they were starting Kevin Porter Jr. in the final game of the playoffs. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5772.42s)]
*  I mean, you can't overstate how bad it was. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5776.66s)]
*  The other thing, if you're a Yanis fan, just to be honest, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5781.22s)]
*  the fact you're proposing this seriously speaks to, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5785.06s)]
*  in my opinion, how disrespected Yanis is. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5787.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is a guy that it was one game only completely handled [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5790.42s)]
*  the Oklahoma City Thunder because he's a star who can initiate offense. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5794.1s)]
*  He can score in volume. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5798.58s)]
*  We know he's much better than say a Jokic at defense. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5800.58s)]
*  I think his capabilities on offense as an initiator are underrated as well. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5803.38s)]
*  And by the way, as long as I'm here rated as well. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5808.74s)]
*  And by resume is at par or better than Jokic. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5810.98s)]
*  If you include all defense, if you include a defensive player of the year, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5815.38s)]
*  if you include the NBA Cup, which hilariously no one does, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5818.98s)]
*  but it's like his resume is there and he's really good. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5822.26s)]
*  He initiates offense. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5826.74s)]
*  He has a mid-range game now and he's dramatically underrated. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5827.7s)]
*  As a Yanis fan, I want him to go somewhere and get his proper recognition. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5833.0599999999995s)]
*  As a Bucs fan, it breaks my heart. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5837.860000000001s)]
*  And as someone who had to watch the Indiana Pacers, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5840.1s)]
*  I'm lucky I still my eyes that I didn't gouge them out. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5842.26s)]
*  And you're also you're dealing with an organization also [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5846.820000000001s)]
*  that just doesn't know what they're doing. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5850.1s)]
*  I know Doc's your friend. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5853.14s)]
*  Sorry, he was a disaster. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5854.5s)]
*  He's coaching from 25 years ago. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5856.02s)]
*  They also haven't adjusted to Yanis's capabilities as an offensive initiator. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5857.9400000000005s)]
*  They're still building the team like it's 2019 [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5863.14s)]
*  when the Toronto Raptors doubles kind of overwhelmed him a bit. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5865.54s)]
*  Although in that series, he was still the best player. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5869.54s)]
*  Had a positive plus minus. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5871.38s)]
*  Didn't play enough minutes. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5872.98s)]
*  But the key is him at point center. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5874.5s)]
*  That's how you win in the playoffs. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5879.62s)]
*  The Bucs, I thought were building towards out the Kuzma trade. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5881.22s)]
*  Doc never plays Kuzma at the four. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5884.34s)]
*  Probably wouldn't have mattered. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5886.34s)]
*  He's horrible. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5887.06s)]
*  But they never even got approaching the right approach with him. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5888.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's just been a disaster all around. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5892.82s)]
*  And at the same time, he's Yanis. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5895.7s)]
*  He's loyal. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5898.1s)]
*  He likes Milwaukee. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5898.9s)]
*  He doesn't want to go somewhere. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5899.86s)]
*  There's a very good chance we're back whenever we get back. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5901.06s)]
*  We were supposed to be out a year ago that the bus got flushed out. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5904.66s)]
*  It was very sad. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5907.14s)]
*  Nothing has happened. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5909.22s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5910.0199999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5911.86s)]
*  You gave me a lot to work with there. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5912.34s)]
*  Sorry, I had to get that all out. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5915.06s)]
*  I was trying to make sure I got that in. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5916.5s)]
*  I expressed my disappointment with your Yanis assertions over the last few weeks. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5918.66s)]
*  Yanis better than Tatum? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5925.62s)]
*  Come on, get out of here. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5926.82s)]
*  Or you have to get him better than Yanis, I should say. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5927.86s)]
*  Well, Tatum's hurt now, so he is better. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5929.7s)]
*  I know. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5931.3s)]
*  I can't even truly go in on him. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5931.62s)]
*  It's very sad. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5932.98s)]
*  A real disappointment. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5933.62s)]
*  Yanis being underrated, that's just Bucs bullshit. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5935.62s)]
*  He's in his third, second, third, fourth, or first in the MVP voting every single year. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5939.3s)]
*  It's not like he falls to nine. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5945.38s)]
*  He's always in the top three or top four. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5947.3s)]
*  He's always first team on the NBA. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5949.3s)]
*  He doesn't get cheap MVPs for finishing six in his conference because some players got hurt. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5951.14s)]
*  For some reason, it's always all his fault. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5956.1s)]
*  Oh, by the way, as long as I'm here, your what if segment a few podcasts ago. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5958.5s)]
*  What if segment? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5964.660000000001s)]
*  This what if is Chris Middleton getting hurt in the 2022 playoffs? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5965.700000000001s)]
*  Well, we had Robert Williams was hurt too. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5968.740000000001s)]
*  Like, come on. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5970.660000000001s)]
*  Get out of here. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5973.22s)]
*  That's even more offensive than comparing Yanis and Evan Mobley. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5974.1s)]
*  Robert Williams and prime Chris Middleton. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5977.860000000001s)]
*  Wait a second. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5980.34s)]
*  So if you're keeping Yanis versus Tatum, if you're trading him, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5981.14s)]
*  you have to trade him to a place that has a chance to win the title. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5984.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5987.62s)]
*  Can we agree on that? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5987.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5989.14s)]
*  So you in to your point, the Bucks need the way the problem is their picks are scattered. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5989.38s)]
*  There's like two swaps in a pick with Portland, which everyone forgets about, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5995.14s)]
*  plus the swap picks with the Pelicans. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=5999.06s)]
*  So if you don't get someone good back, you have to get some of those picks back. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6001.46s)]
*  There's no hope for the franchise. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6005.86s)]
*  Otherwise, that's a conundrum. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6007.46s)]
*  No Portland doesn't want Yanis because they're on their own timeline and he's not going to want [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6009.3s)]
*  to go to New Orleans. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6013.54s)]
*  So you're not getting those picks back. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6014.5s)]
*  Well, it's a three or four way deal. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6016.0199999999995s)]
*  If something like that happens in reality, there's two options and maybe one dark horse [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6017.54s)]
*  that makes sense for the Bucks. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6023.7s)]
*  Option number one is a package around Amen Thompson. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6025.54s)]
*  Amen Thompson. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6028.58s)]
*  There's like, I personally think Amen might be a little overrated right now, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6029.3s)]
*  which means if I'm the Rockets, I should definitely want to trade him. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6035.7s)]
*  But that is that it has to be someone like that or the number two pick from the Spurs. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6038.42s)]
*  And both teams can throw in a lot of extra picks and assets. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6042.9s)]
*  Those are the only two that from a Bucks perspective make sense. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6046.259999999999s)]
*  And every Bucks fan is going to kill me. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6050.42s)]
*  There is a potential Philadelphia 76ers package as well. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6054.74s)]
*  What? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6057.94s)]
*  What is it? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6059.54s)]
*  Maxi, McCain, number three pick. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6059.86s)]
*  And they have the Clippers pick. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6063.219999999999s)]
*  They have a surprisingly high number of assets. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6065.7s)]
*  I don't think it works because they have a similar problem to the Bucks. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6069.3s)]
*  They have a 50 million or 60 million dollar hole on their roster. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6073.22s)]
*  Our hole is named Damian Lillard. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6076.74s)]
*  Their hole is named Joel Embiid. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6078.1s)]
*  But they do have a shockingly high number of assets [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6079.7s)]
*  augmented by getting the number three pick. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6083.54s)]
*  I'm Yanis though. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6085.14s)]
*  I'm staying in Milwaukee over going to Philly and rolling the dice with Embiid. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6085.9400000000005s)]
*  Why am I doing that? [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6089.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, me too. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6090.900000000001s)]
*  I'm just putting that out there because no one's talking about it. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6092.26s)]
*  I think it's actually kind of interesting. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6094.58s)]
*  And if I was Yanis, I'd want to stay in the East. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6096.5s)]
*  Like it is. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6098.74s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6099.78s)]
*  Who's your pick for the East next year? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6101.3s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6104.0199999999995s)]
*  It's New York and Indiana. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6104.74s)]
*  It's the Celtics are probably out of the mix. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6106.34s)]
*  Your team's in there. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6109.78s)]
*  Detroit. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6110.58s)]
*  Yeah, Orlando. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6111.94s)]
*  I mean, Detroit might be the one. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6113.46s)]
*  I mean, here's my advice to you. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6114.66s)]
*  I have advice for the Celtics. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6115.94s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6118.179999999999s)]
*  Don't I don't want your advice on the Celtics. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6119.139999999999s)]
*  It ties to the Bucks though. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6120.66s)]
*  The Celtics need to blow it up. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6121.78s)]
*  The Bucks though. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6123.46s)]
*  The Bucks problem was trying to preserve the old model, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6124.0199999999995s)]
*  which was built around holiday, pressuring the ballhand where Lopez backing them up. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6127.62s)]
*  The moment you get Dame, that whole thing needs to change. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6132.0199999999995s)]
*  You need to reorganize the team, get a bunch of wings. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6135.54s)]
*  Resigning Lopez was a mistake, you know, not prioritizing the wrong people. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6139.86s)]
*  Even at the minimum level was a mistake. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6145.46s)]
*  And to me, this sucks for Celtics, but they should trade everyone. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6148.26s)]
*  You're saying the window, eight year window, it's now closed. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6154.26s)]
*  Blow it up, rebuild around Tatum. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6158.1s)]
*  And you have a chance to rebuild it because Tatum, what, just started his extension? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6159.700000000001s)]
*  Like this was the Bucks mistake is the further you go down trading the future, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6163.3s)]
*  you're so pot committed and so in the hole that it's, I mean, best case scenario, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6168.18s)]
*  people on Bucks Twitter all about trade, like their late first on pick this year to try to get [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6175.06s)]
*  to or trade their 20, 31 pick to get two picks this year. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6180.1s)]
*  Try to just sort of get enough people and like pray for like two years from now. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6184.02s)]
*  When you have a 35 year old point guard coming off in the Achilles industry, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6189.38s)]
*  like that's our best case scenario. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6192.9800000000005s)]
*  It's very ugly. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6195.38s)]
*  It's not great. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6196.660000000001s)]
*  Well, if you go through the contenders, Oklahoma city, if they lose one of the next two rounds, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6198.34s)]
*  I guess it'd be a possibility. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6205.22s)]
*  But if I'm Oklahoma city and I'm taking the giant money Yanis is making combined with all [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6206.82s)]
*  the other money, they're going to have to show out. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6210.9s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm doing that. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6213.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6214.98s)]
*  The problem with Oklahoma city is you're showing out money to guys who I don't think [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6215.139999999999s)]
*  might not be worth that money. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6218.98s)]
*  I mean, they're there. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6220.5s)]
*  I understand what they're doing, keeping all these picks and having a few stars and just [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6222.099999999999s)]
*  continually cycling, cycling everyone out around them. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6226.82s)]
*  I love Jaylen Williams on my fantasy team. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6231.219999999999s)]
*  I've had him the last two years. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6233.299999999999s)]
*  The regular season is not the playoffs. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6234.58s)]
*  That is never been clear than ever. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6236.58s)]
*  The problem though is any picks from a team Yanis goes to are worthless because Yanis [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6240.34s)]
*  is really good and will make those picks worthless. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6248.1s)]
*  So you need picks from other teams or a three. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6250.58s)]
*  I mean, they could maybe do a three way sort of trade with the Palakins or Portland or [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6253.22s)]
*  something like that, but very hard to pull off. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6257.78s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6259.22s)]
*  So I'm going to say OKC is a thumbs down. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6259.86s)]
*  They're in the conversation, but again, Presti probably wouldn't do it. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6262.98s)]
*  I mean, I think realistically, if they get the Yanis, they're going to win. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6266.66s)]
*  I mean, the problem is I don't feel like Sam Presti really wants to win, which is why I'm [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6270.18s)]
*  cheering against Oklahoma City continuously. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6275.46s)]
*  I feel like in the NBA, you should have to go for it. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6277.7s)]
*  You just whip in the takes out tonight. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6280.58s)]
*  Sam Presti doesn't really want to win. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6281.94s)]
*  That's a take. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6283.62s)]
*  I would say he wants to win. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6284.42s)]
*  He's trying to build a ten year sustainable project. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6285.86s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6288.74s)]
*  It's the small market version of light years. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6290.18s)]
*  This idea that instead of going all in around what you have and doing everything possible [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6294.9s)]
*  to get one. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6299.78s)]
*  And by the way, the Bucks got one. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6300.5s)]
*  I am fundamentally disappointed Yanis doesn't have more. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6303.14s)]
*  I'm disappointed the Bucks have more. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6307.78s)]
*  I am very grateful that they got one and we'll talk to Oklahoma City fans. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6309.46s)]
*  If they end up getting it, then congratulations. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6315.06s)]
*  I think that Minnesota is pretty good. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6317.38s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6319.62s)]
*  If they get one, congratulations. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6321.14s)]
*  If they don't, let's talk in a decade and see how you felt about the decade long project [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6322.5s)]
*  to make the Western Conference Finals. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6326.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's how I feel about the Celtics from 2016 and now it's a nine year run. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6328.82s)]
*  They won one title, but at least we had the one title you have. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6333.3s)]
*  You had the honest thing. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6336.66s)]
*  Everyone is like, oh my God, Yanis, how is he in this situation? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6337.62s)]
*  Well, you made two massive trades where he gave up a shitload of assets and it paid off [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6341.54s)]
*  with the title. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6347.139999999999s)]
*  Then it didn't pay off with Dame, but that's how you get in this situation. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6348.5s)]
*  At the end of the day, the last time I was on here was after the Dame trade. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6352.5s)]
*  I should probably not come on spitting takes. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6357.3s)]
*  I should come on eating some humble pie after how that turned out. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6359.54s)]
*  We argued about that for the entire summer. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6362.58s)]
*  You're right. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6365.86s)]
*  I will come out and admit that's the case. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6367.38s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6370.099999999999s)]
*  They went for it and it didn't work out. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6371.62s)]
*  I had a decade of Yanis. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6374.259999999999s)]
*  The Bucks won a title, which I didn't think I'd ever see in my lifetime. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6376.34s)]
*  So at the end of the day, I'm good and I practice self care. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6379.62s)]
*  I just don't watch too many Bucks games when I realize what's exactly what's going to happen. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6383.139999999999s)]
*  If you go through the contenders, Nicks, I mean, I don't see. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6388.58s)]
*  No, this is the one that bugs me. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6393.139999999999s)]
*  The Knicks blew their load and that's where I wanted Yanis to go. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6395.78s)]
*  If this was going to go wrong, I wanted him in Madison Square Garden. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6399.46s)]
*  When 100% would get the respect he deserves, would get the internet fighters he deserves, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6403.22s)]
*  and would just blow up that city. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6408.1s)]
*  And alas, I guess if you want Mikael Bridges instead, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6410.5s)]
*  better win this year or else you're going to hear it from me for a while. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6414.5s)]
*  Well, what if the Knicks fell short in one of the next two rounds and then there's some sort of [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6417.860000000001s)]
*  towns with bridges for Yanis and the problem is they don't have any picks to throw in. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6422.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's no good for the Bucks. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6427.54s)]
*  I mean, the Bucks need, it's a small market team. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6428.740000000001s)]
*  You're not going to get a bunch, you're not going to think how the Knicks built their team is, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6432.26s)]
*  all things considered, pretty impressive. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6438.18s)]
*  I think the Bridges trade was probably the mistake just because of how much you gave. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6440.66s)]
*  Well, unless they win the title, then it's not a mistake. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6444.18s)]
*  Exactly. No, that's the thing. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6446.820000000001s)]
*  It's a little humbling that they've made it this far because I dropped that take earlier [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6448.66s)]
*  in the playoffs on Twitter and Knicks fans have been throwing it in my face ever since. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6451.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's a fair point. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6455.7s)]
*  That's the other, I'm actually curious if you update the book of basketball again, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6456.58s)]
*  which we all know now that you're a professional podcaster, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6462.5s)]
*  I don't know if you've written anything. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6465.7s)]
*  Is that above typing? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6466.9s)]
*  Exactly. You can't do it on your phone or maybe you can. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6469.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6472.1s)]
*  How do you evaluate players from this era? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6474.5s)]
*  I just compared Yanis and Jokic. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6478.5s)]
*  If Yanis and Jokic play in the 80s and 90s, both who have games that I think would scale [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6481.3s)]
*  to those eras in a world where the illegal defense, player movement, all these sorts of things [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6487.06s)]
*  favor stars to such a massive extent. Do they have more than one title? Unquestionably. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6494.42s)]
*  Does the fact the NBA is going to have seven teams in seven years actually mean that both [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6500.9s)]
*  of them deserve a bit of an adjustment in their all-time rankings despite only having one title? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6505.78s)]
*  It's pretty interesting to think about historically. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6512.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because 30 teams, a lot of talent. It's way harder to keep a team together like we're [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6515.54s)]
*  seeing now with the Celtics and some other ones. I always compare the guys in the era first. You [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6521.62s)]
*  got to start there with who are you going against and how much did you stand out? Both of those [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6529.219999999999s)]
*  guys qualify. I think both of them are in that Shaq, Moses, Hakeem kind of area. I think Durant [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6533.299999999999s)]
*  is probably in there too. Somewhere in that 11 to 16 range. I think what Jokic has done [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6541.3s)]
*  year after year offensively might give them a little bit of a trump card. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6551.3s)]
*  Janis is basically 30, 12, and 6 for seven straight years. Go through and look at the [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6556.58s)]
*  resumes. It would actually surprise you. Jokic's one advantage is one more MVP, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6561.38s)]
*  which I think was BS, but whatever. Add in defensive impact, defensive player of the year, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6567.9400000000005s)]
*  all defensive teams, and Bill, the Emirates NBA Cuff. Come on. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6573.3s)]
*  Well, wait. Let's go back to the exercise of going through all the contenders because you [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6580.1s)]
*  mentioned Houston. I want to come back to them. Knicks are out. Lakers are out. Denver's out. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6584.5s)]
*  Indiana, I just can't imagine the right trade for that. You start going down the list. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6590.5s)]
*  Minnesota. Houston, San Antonio. Houston's the one that should do it. Is there a Golden State [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6597.54s)]
*  anything that interests you there? Nothing? No. It's ridiculous. The Golden State and their [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6602.34s)]
*  organization and the media and the fans have fully completed their transition to Lakerdom. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6608.74s)]
*  Just delusionally overrating their players, assuming everyone will just end up on their team. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6614.74s)]
*  There's no world. I mean, number one, as long as we're insulting your takes, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6621.78s)]
*  Jonathan Kamiga stinks. Athletic specimen, to be sure, doesn't know what he's doing anywhere in the [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6627.46s)]
*  court. I would love to see Yannis and Curry together. We thought we were getting that with [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6633.139999999999s)]
*  Yannis and Dame. The Yannis and Dame problem is, and this is a classic NBA problem, it's actually [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6637.219999999999s)]
*  been really interesting to watch, which is one of my, one of those interesting players I watched [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6645.3s)]
*  on the Bucs was Christian Wood. And Christian Wood was a very skilled player. The problem was [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6651.54s)]
*  he could only play as the number one guy. He was completely incapable of scaling down to another [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6658.9s)]
*  position. And he wants to be the number one. And so you can see what happens when he's the number [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6664.9s)]
*  one guy. He goes to Detroit, scores a lot of points and that team wins like 15 games. Like that's the [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6668.98s)]
*  quality of his being a number one guy. And he also played the same position as Yannis. So some Bucs [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6672.9s)]
*  fans were upset when we shipped him out, but to me it was obvious. He was never ever going to be [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6677.78s)]
*  sort of a useful player in that regard. There's a little bit of a similar dynamic with Dame. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6681.46s)]
*  Dame's a great player. I'm not comparing him to Christian Wood at all. He carried those [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6687.3s)]
*  Portland teams for years and years and he carried them mostly to the second round of the playoffs. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6691.54s)]
*  And he couldn't really scale to being a number two when Yannis is a top two number one guy. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6696.82s)]
*  And that was really the core problem. When Dame played by himself, it was great. When Yannis played [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6704.34s)]
*  by himself, it was great. And when Dame played with Yannis, it was this weird passiveness. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6711.3s)]
*  It felt like he was being passive aggressive about it, but I don't think that was the case. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6717.700000000001s)]
*  I just think he wasn't able to sort of scale in that way. And so from a basketball fan perspective, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6721.3s)]
*  I love watching this with teams. You see an up and coming team and they have to figure out [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6727.780000000001s)]
*  organically who's the number one guy, who's the number two guy, who's number three guy. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6732.82s)]
*  It's the human component of basketball that's so interesting. And if I weren't a Buck fan suffering [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6736.0199999999995s)]
*  through it, watching the Yannis-Dame experience was experience in that way. And that's the [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6742.099999999999s)]
*  fundamental reason why I think it didn't work out. Yeah, I noticed it. Not really having a dog in the [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6749.54s)]
*  race. Sometimes guys really have trouble figuring out when to slide in and out. I think that's what's [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6755.38s)]
*  been so impressive over the years with Jalen Brown is he feels like it's Tatum's team, but he has a [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6760.9s)]
*  sense of when to come and go, depending on the moment. But at least when we had those guys [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6767.0599999999995s)]
*  together. It's easier when you have two number two guys. So well, the only other team there was, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6771.78s)]
*  there was a Memphis one too for, I'm ignoring you. There was a Memphis, like a Jaren Jackson one, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6777.86s)]
*  but the reason I thought of the Mobley was because you get a guy on your contract for five years. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6785.86s)]
*  He's one of the 15 or 16 best guys in the league and still has some room. I think he is when I do [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6791.54s)]
*  ringer a hundred, I have him and I forget what I had him in the last one, but you know, he just [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6797.94s)]
*  won defensive player of the year. The problem with all this stuff is the playoffs are so different [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6803.219999999999s)]
*  than the regular season. It's a cliche, but it's more true than ever. And the problem with Mobley [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6807.299999999999s)]
*  and what you need in a guy like that is someone who imposes himself on the other team, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6813.46s)]
*  someone that the other team has to react to. That's not going to be Ahmed Thompson either. I hate to break it to you. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6819.86s)]
*  I don't think so either, honest, but I think there's at least the potential there. I mean, I [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6824.26s)]
*  would say Mobley has as much potential for that. I don't know. He's been in the league five, six years. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6829.86s)]
*  When is he, what have you felt Mobley imposing himself on you? Like Thompson has done that [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6834.9s)]
*  on the defensive end and occasional flashes on offense. Now again, to be clear, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6841.14s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think he's going to get there offensively, but he's young enough. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6847.14s)]
*  But the ceiling is worth the bet. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6852.42s)]
*  The ceiling, if I'm the Bucs, I can see it. To me, the play is probably San Antonio, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6854.18s)]
*  which is disgusting to me. So you're saying number two, Devin Vassell to make the contracts work, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6861.46s)]
*  one other contract and then more picks. A ton of picks. They have a huge stash of picks. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6868.5s)]
*  Interesting ones. They have like an Atlanta pick. The key thing is you need, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6875.14s)]
*  ideally you get picks from teams you're not trading Yanis to because Yanis is going to make those [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6880.98s)]
*  picks worthless. And so you either need hope that the Bucs can take into a good player, which means [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6885.62s)]
*  you need the Portland picks back and the Pelicans picks back, which is going to be really hard. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6893.54s)]
*  Or you need someone like Thompson that I would love to get a Thompson Jersey. That does make me [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6897.700000000001s)]
*  excited. Or you make me something like the number two pick that there, you got your [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6903.700000000001s)]
*  tank-tastic pick right off the bat. And then you're basically like, I don't care about our own picks. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6909.38s)]
*  Those are sunk costs. Let's just try to figure this out. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6915.54s)]
*  You need at least one core piece, either the chance at it with your own picks or the number [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6919.54s)]
*  two pick or Thompson. And it's really hard to see anything else. I mean, maybe the number three [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6925.54s)]
*  pick, but also it seems like Harper's the clear number two. And I'm still not sold on that. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6929.62s)]
*  By the way, I looked at my ringer hundred that I turned in for the last time we did it, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6935.06s)]
*  which is a couple of weeks ago. I had Moby 13th. He's 23 years old. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6938.58s)]
*  You know, in NBA history, even if you put them at 13th, the gap between [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6943.54s)]
*  1.5 and 13, it's astronomical. So I read the Bucs just tank. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6947.62s)]
*  Well, I guess they can't tank. They have no picks. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6953.62s)]
*  Well, the real move is to keep Yanis and take it into the season, say he's staying, see how it goes. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6956.34s)]
*  And then he'll probably have just as much, if not more value from December to February. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6963.94s)]
*  I would think. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6968.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It's just so hard to trade a contract to that size. That's the other thing that makes [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6968.5s)]
*  this difficult is as how many of these teams have sufficient flotsam to trade to make up that the [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6971.78s)]
*  salary difference. I mean, I personally am probably the most pro Houston, even though [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6978.58s)]
*  I'm hesitant about Thompson, I'm pro Houston for Yanis sake in that they are like an amazing team [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6984.0199999999995s)]
*  with no star. That's their problem. And Yanis, I think putting Yanis, they would have to build [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6991.7s)]
*  around him. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6998.58s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm not doing that trade if I'm Houston, if I have to also give up Thompson, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=6999.38s)]
*  because I need him to be one of my best three guys to actually try to win the title. If I'm [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7003.46s)]
*  actually trading for Yanis, you know what I mean? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7008.02s)]
*  Yanis, because you're, no, because you're getting one, one of the best or arguably the [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7010.02s)]
*  best player in the NBA. I think, I think Houston with Yanis, with their assets wins a title with [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7013.9400000000005s)]
*  Yanis. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7019.14s)]
*  Thompson was their best player in the playoffs though. Dan Bleak, Dylan Brooks, like that. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7019.620000000001s)]
*  I don't think that's it. You need Thompson. You need all the stuff he does. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7024.900000000001s)]
*  That's- [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7028.1s)]
*  I was going to make a joke about he was the best player in the playoffs at the end of the [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7028.34s)]
*  first round, but as a Bucks fan, it's hard to make that joke. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7031.06s)]
*  Yeah. No. So you're thinking, so you would do Thompson. I think the Van Vliet contract [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7034.26s)]
*  probably has to be in it to make the Yanis thing work. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7041.54s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's a fake trade somewhere, a bunch of trades. Yeah. I think ideally we [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7043.780000000001s)]
*  would get someone like Jabari Smith too. Jabari Smith might be bad. His three point [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7048.660000000001s)]
*  percentages are disappointing. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7053.620000000001s)]
*  I like him. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7054.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He hasn't played with great guards. So that's, that's kind of the argument for it. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7055.54s)]
*  He's definitely just a supporting piece. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7059.06s)]
*  Just think of him in the corner and just tell him the jack up threes if they happen to pass [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7060.18s)]
*  him the ball. And that's kind of what he does. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7064.5s)]
*  I mean, I am someone that's easy to get overly biased by summer league. Jabari Smith was [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7066.66s)]
*  awesome at summer league last year. He was like, oh, or a couple of years ago, the number [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7071.22s)]
*  two player making a leap. Ahmaud Thompson. Oh man. One of the best summer league debuts [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7074.18s)]
*  ever. They're just absolutely incredible. But yeah, it's probably Texas or bust. Yanis, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7079.06s)]
*  by the way, very cheap, no taxes. He will like that a lot. That literally might be what [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7085.38s)]
*  pushes him over the edge. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7090.5s)]
*  I know. But see the problem is the reason I like the Cleveland trade for him was because, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7091.62s)]
*  all right, if I'm leaving Milwaukee, I have all these ties here. I've been here since 2013. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7097.06s)]
*  I want to go to a place where I'm now the favorite to win the title. That's not the case. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7102.1s)]
*  If he goes to Houston or San Antonio, do you flip him in Mowgli? He is now the favorite to come out [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7106.18s)]
*  of the East, like unquestionably with the team they already have. And that's what I thought was [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7111.94s)]
*  the appealing piece. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7116.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think I get your point. It's interesting. Are you looking at it from the [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7116.98s)]
*  Yanis perspective or the Bucks perspective? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7121.54s)]
*  I think you have to look at it from the Yanis perspective because you're throwing him a solid [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7123.86s)]
*  by trading him because he's your guy. And if you want to put him in a good situation. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7127.78s)]
*  In the Bucks defense, I think they've made a lot of poor decisions. I don't understand why John [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7131.94s)]
*  Horse got a contract extension. I think he's done a terrible job, but they did spend a lot of money. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7136.9s)]
*  They did win a title. I think they've done right by Yanis, all things considered. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7145.139999999999s)]
*  And you owe it to the organization to maximize the return. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7150.42s)]
*  But what if he calls, he's like, I will go to these three spots and Houston's not one of them. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7154.5s)]
*  Then it gets a little, I personally don't think going to San Antonio guarantees him anything. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7160.58s)]
*  I don't know if one Benyama, like do we even know he's going to be playing 60 games a year with his [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7165.62s)]
*  his body makes me nervous. He's already gone down once. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7171.3s)]
*  Look, here's the deal. San Antonio may have a disappointing supporting cast. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7174.26s)]
*  That supporting cast is like 10 X better than what the Bucks were trying to this year. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7179.78s)]
*  But you're in the West. I'm in the West instead of the East. If I'm in, if I'm on Cleveland, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7185.22s)]
*  I'm cruising. I have to worry about the Knicks and the Celtics two years from now. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7190.18s)]
*  And the trade for Yanis, it'd be great. I'm saying for the Bucks, it'd be a disaster. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7194.02s)]
*  You want to send them the other conference. If you're the Bucks, it's not even that I don't mind. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7200.9800000000005s)]
*  Actually, I would like Yanis to go to the East for Yanis sake because I want him to win a [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7204.9800000000005s)]
*  bunch more titles. And it's definitely going to be much easier if you're the Bucks, though, [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7209.38s)]
*  and you're facing this one of the worst holes in NBA history. You need more than Evan Mobley. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7213.860000000001s)]
*  That's just sort of the law. So the law is short of it. I mean, I actually I know three way and [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7220.5s)]
*  four way trades are hard, but I think if this happened, the only two direct trades that make [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7226.82s)]
*  sense are San Antonio and Houston. If there are possibilities that are almost impossible for us [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7234.42s)]
*  to build. And you see some of these trades come down and they actually get really quite complicated. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7240.9s)]
*  So Yanis goes to Cleveland, Mobley goes somewhere else. A whole bunch of stuff. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7244.66s)]
*  Or he goes to some other middle somewhat contender. And then some of those picks start coming back. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7248.74s)]
*  I think that's probably a chance to happen. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7258.42s)]
*  Do you think Cleveland, what if Milwaukee came back and said, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7261.54s)]
*  we'll do it if it's Mobley and Garland? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7265.86s)]
*  So what? We can have the same playoff performance Cleveland has had? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7268.5s)]
*  And we'll dump, we'll give Yanis and dump a contract on you and you can have Yanis and [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7270.82s)]
*  Mitchell. Then I don't think that makes sense if I'm Cleveland. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7275.3s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I mean, where are you? What are you building for Milwaukee? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7278.1s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if you want to be a sort of a middling team that has a second round [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7281.22s)]
*  ceiling, then just keep Yanis. That's, you know, again, it's only it's ultimately up to Yanis. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7285.7s)]
*  I mean, he's not he's he didn't he's not a US superstar. He didn't grow up in that culture. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7291.94s)]
*  He's well documented his sort of background where he came from. He's very comfortable in [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7297.78s)]
*  Milwaukee. He likes the idea. You leave out the part that he has a ring already. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7303.38s)]
*  It's not like he has to go chase it. That's right. And you know, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7307.9400000000005s)]
*  as my heart, my heart is split because it does kill me to listen to you, to listen to everyone [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7312.900000000001s)]
*  else. I think underappreciate how great he is because of how bad this situation is. And I want [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7319.3s)]
*  better for him. But I've had I love having him on my team. So when I voted for him for third for MVP, [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7326.82s)]
*  should I put little stars next to it to show how much I cared? Or what did you want from me? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7333.22s)]
*  Would put a little chocolate on it? I just I want I don't want any comments about Tatum being better. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7337.860000000001s)]
*  I don't want to Tatum was better than the first 5560 games of the year. And then Yanis came on [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7344.5s)]
*  like a freight train. Yeah, you know, I don't know. You're pretty good all year. I will say one thing. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7350.02s)]
*  Can I can I do one Yanis critique? He does get a free pass for how when his teammates don't play [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7353.860000000001s)]
*  well when they're next to him, it's always their fault. It's a little bit of LeBron, LeBron ish. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7359.86s)]
*  Everybody like Malik Beasley is really good on Detroit now. How was Malik Beasley in the playoffs? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7364.42s)]
*  He was good with Milwaukee the regular season also. And then he stunk in the playoffs. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7370.259999999999s)]
*  Grayson Allen was really good on Phoenix the year he left Milwaukee. I don't know. It's just [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7374.74s)]
*  we kids love it with Yanis a little bit. Yanis fucked up on the Halbert and drives in that game [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7379.139999999999s)]
*  that they blew like Halbert went by three times in a row. I thought he was this octopus on defense. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7384.179999999999s)]
*  Grayson Allen great in the season, stunk in the playoffs. That's what happened in the bucks, too. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7389.94s)]
*  You have a small guy with a slow release. They don't they don't listen. Grayson Allen was the [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7393.0599999999995s)]
*  hero of the two thousand twenty two Celtics comeback. Jason Tatum at every one of those [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7398.74s)]
*  Coach K camps should be buying Grayson Allen caviar like he was a secret weapon. I mean, it was. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7403.7s)]
*  Oh, I'm still mad at Bud about that. I mean, oh, but we get it. It could always get worse. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7411.299999999999s)]
*  That's the Bud lesson. All right. So so we go. You're you're in favor of keeping Yanis or Godfather [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7417.86s)]
*  offer from San Antonio or Houston, because the one other thing we didn't mention when Davis went to [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7424.9s)]
*  the Lakers, the Lakers really wanted Davis because of LeBron and they had this window and they they [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7429.139999999999s)]
*  were going to do whatever it took. Ishby when he really wanted to rent, he's like, fine, I'll [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7435.0599999999995s)]
*  throw in Cam Johnson. I'll do anything it takes. I don't know who the I'll do anything it takes to [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7439.46s)]
*  get Yanis team is yet. I mean, that that would only because it hasn't emerged. Maybe it'll emerge [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7444.98s)]
*  over the next two rounds. Yeah. I mean, we didn't see Minnesota emerge for Gobert until the trade [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7452.5s)]
*  actually happened. Right. And that package was pretty significant. And I think we can agree that [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7457.94s)]
*  Gobert is not even close to the level of player that that Yanis is. So and that, by the way, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7465.299999999999s)]
*  no one was putting in the Timberwolves as competitors. I'm still not sure I like that [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7471.06s)]
*  trade, to be honest, a few years later. But you can't deny they gave away way too much. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7475.46s)]
*  I mean, it worked out. What both things could be right. I need a rankings prediction, Bill. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7481.54s)]
*  If Anthony Edwards wins this year at the age he won at, I mean, we're no, you're in like magic [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7487.38s)]
*  bird magic bird under 25 territory. It's fully appreciated the trajectory that he might be on. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7496.26s)]
*  It's it's pretty amazing. Ben Thompson, you can follow or subscribe to the Stratechery [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7503.3s)]
*  newsletter, which has been an essential piece of does not have any NBA talk, which is probably [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7511.38s)]
*  best for everyone. No, it's good. Good to see you. Thanks for getting up early for us. Talk to you later. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yF-RXkgoMg&t=7517.62s)]
