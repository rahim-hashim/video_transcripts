# Hey NBA? Run From The NFL, Blow Up Your Schedule and Have a July Finals! | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=0.0s)]
*  So when I was in Austin, Texas last month for a live show, we went to your sports [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=0.5s)]
*  business class at the university of Texas in Austin, had a bunch of really smart [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=5.22s)]
*  people, um, who had been working for a while on a big project. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=12.34s)]
*  So you explained what the project was. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=17.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=19.22s)]
*  Like, so when the semester began, I'll take you back to January of 2025 and, and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=19.56s)]
*  you and Rosilla and a bunch of people were doing, um, check-ins on the NBA vibe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=23.62s)]
*  And at that time, the story was ratings are way down. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=28.98s)]
*  Um, and so we designed a case around what's going on with the NBA and what [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=32.4s)]
*  would you do to change it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=38.22s)]
*  And we had a bunch of students, like 40 or 50 students, and we'd work with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=40.1s)]
*  Fandool, they'd send us some of their handle data, which was really interesting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=43.44s)]
*  So to go beyond just TV ratings and look at betting handle as a proxy for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  interest in the league as a sort of a live betting and the, yeah, all that stuff. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=57.52s)]
*  Cause the theory is like, whether you gamble or not, I think we would all admit [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=57.78s)]
*  if there are more bets on a game, that probably means more people are paying [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=61.44s)]
*  attention to it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=65.02s)]
*  It might not just be on in the background. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=65.8s)]
*  People are actually paying attention to it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=67.08s)]
*  And, you know, the, the, the key thing we found right away is that it is a good [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=69.06s)]
*  proxy for interest. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=72.9s)]
*  It may mix a lot of the TV ratings stuff we saw early in the season, which sort [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=73.94s)]
*  of troughed in December and rebounded with that famous Christmas night game, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=78.38s)]
*  between the Lakers and Warriors. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=83.84s)]
*  And now we're slightly down year over year, but I had the students like, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=86.56s)]
*  Hey, what would you do? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  What would you recommend to the commissioner of the NBA to improve the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  popularity of our broadcasts and the overall league itself? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  So right now the season is 82 games. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=101.4s)]
*  It starts on October 22nd this year. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  It ended on April 13th. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=107.48s)]
*  It's 24 weeks, 82 games. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=109.2s)]
*  The plan is the mid April first three rounds of the playoffs this year [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=111.38s)]
*  starts April 19th ends June 2nd. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=115.26s)]
*  So it's seven plus weeks for those three rounds and the final starts June 5th. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=118.62s)]
*  And ends June 22nd. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=125.1s)]
*  And your students decided what? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=128.06s)]
*  Got to start later. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=130.58s)]
*  Move the start 45 days later in the calendar. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=131.5s)]
*  Another opening day is in December. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=135.7s)]
*  You still get that Christmas slate and you go into July bill. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=138.16s)]
*  And this is really for one main reason, which is to get away from the monster [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=143.12s)]
*  that is football, specifically NFL and college football, which hogs all of our [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=150.12s)]
*  attention and hogs my attention in the fall, it hogs your attention. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=155.44s)]
*  And we think that there's a compelling case for the NBA to consider moving out [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=159.88s)]
*  from under that boot of the football attention and an intention economy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=165.42s)]
*  I think if you play more of your games in January, February, March, April, May, June, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=170.7s)]
*  July, there's a much better chance for better television audiences and other [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=177.3s)]
*  sort of signs of interest. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=182.98s)]
*  So two things with that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=185.14s)]
*  They're launching the season, October 22nd. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=186.82s)]
*  They're going against the world series. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=189.26s)]
*  They're going against the, the NFL season has really kicked into gear. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=192.36s)]
*  All the teams are starting to play better. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=197.16s)]
*  It's like the height of college football. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  The presidential election. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=200.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  Every four years of presidential election is coming. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=203.72s)]
*  Um, and they're just popping right in the middle of that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  And people are like, cool, thanks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=209.36s)]
*  They're going the way they have it structured now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=211.24s)]
*  They're basically going against the NFL for the first 11 weeks of the NBA season. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  So it's like 45% of the season. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=219.46s)]
*  They're just going head to head against the NFL. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=221.78s)]
*  Now the playoffs, there's less games. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=223.36s)]
*  Eventually they have the, I talked about how stupid this was a couple of weeks ago. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=224.8s)]
*  NFL ends, Superbowl ends the NFL. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  The NBA has already done their trade deadlines. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=232.36s)]
*  So they lose that whole bump from whenever that happens. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=233.96s)]
*  And then they go right to the all-star break. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  And what happens during the all-star break? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  There's no basketball and everybody's complaining about how bad all-star weekend is. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  So that's, that's your first arrival. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=244.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  And then what always happens is we hit the end of February and there's good [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=246.78s)]
*  basketball games and people are like, Whoa, the NBA has got really good. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  It's like, now the NBA was really good. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=254.52s)]
*  Actually you just, you were concentrated on the football. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=256.52s)]
*  So I was like in 45 days seemed like a lot to me. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=259.62s)]
*  And I did all these different, I sketched it out a bunch of different ways. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=263.44s)]
*  And I think 45 days is around the right number. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=268.0s)]
*  So the first thing I did was 42. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=270.78s)]
*  So if you move everything 42 days, that's six weeks. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=273.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=276.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=276.86s)]
*  That starts the season on December 3rd, the week after Thanksgiving, at least [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=278.42s)]
*  that that's what would have happened this year. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=282.66s)]
*  You start December 3rd, 24 weeks ends, May 25th, play in May 27th to May 30th. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=284.1s)]
*  First three rounds, May 31st ends July 21st. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=293.5s)]
*  And then the finals go July 24th ends August 21st. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=298.38s)]
*  10th. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=303.54s)]
*  That seems too late to me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=304.82s)]
*  I love second eight to me. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=307.18s)]
*  The goal should be, how do we get away from football as much as possible? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=309.94s)]
*  How do we take advantage of all of June instead of having the finals end [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=314.1s)]
*  on like June 18th, June 19th? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=317.82s)]
*  Why are we throwing away June? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=319.86s)]
*  And then could July really work for us? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=321.58s)]
*  And I think we both agree it could. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=324.38s)]
*  And your students, I mean, talk about the case they made for July. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=326.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=331.46s)]
*  July traditionally, and we had, we were lucky enough, Bob Iger came to our class [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=331.64s)]
*  a couple of weeks before and said, there's a metric called HUTs, households [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  using television that traditionally says July is a no-fly zone on television. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=339.7s)]
*  Like that's why there's no new shows. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=344.18s)]
*  But with streaming and the changing landscape of media consumption, even [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=346.64s)]
*  he was saying, this is no longer the case. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=351.26s)]
*  Like July is open for business. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=353.86s)]
*  There's, there's streamers that are launching huge shows during the summer now. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  I think it's a little bit antiquated to say that there's no business [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=360.68s)]
*  case for playing high level basketball games. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a lot antiquated. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=367.8s)]
*  I don't think this shit matters anymore. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  The whole model of like TV goes from September to May. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=369.6s)]
*  And we have three networks and we release stuff and we have sweeps and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=373.72s)]
*  like, it's fucking out, shows can hit any time of the year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=377.32s)]
*  And if you're on vacation, you have, you bring your cable package with you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=380.88s)]
*  All of us are bringing Hulu or YouTube TV or whatever it is with us, wherever we're going. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  I do think it is a fair criticism, Bill, to say that the NBA finals being in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=389.18s)]
*  July would be annoying to a lot of the key stakeholders, whether those are the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  players, the coaches, the executives, the people running the buildings, people in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=398.26s)]
*  Phoenix or Los Angeles might not want to be in town in July. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=406.02s)]
*  Those kinds of thoughts are relevant here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=409.5s)]
*  But ultimately I think there is a strong business case to be made that we could [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=412.1s)]
*  play the playoffs in the finals later in the spring than we currently do. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=417.9s)]
*  That's where I landed. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  That's where the students landed. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=423.82s)]
*  And I think it's, it's compelling enough. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  The league should consider it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=428.78s)]
*  Well, so there's two big things. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  One, the number of weeks you could just get away from football is just [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=431.88s)]
*  the 100% positive that's it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=436.14s)]
*  Like you're not equal to football. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=438.58s)]
*  You're not going to be, it's a way bigger audience. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=440.84s)]
*  You don't have the gambling fantasy stuff that football has. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=443.73999999999995s)]
*  You don't have the ability for everybody to mobilize around Sundays. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=446.8s)]
*  And football is getting better and better at doing their own schedule. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=449.92s)]
*  They're better at, oh, here's a Friday game. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=453.32s)]
*  Oh, now we're going to have two Christmas games. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=456.24s)]
*  Oh, now we're going to tackle Saturdays. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  Like football is just going to get better and better at killing the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=460.72s)]
*  NBA during these first two months. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=463.64s)]
*  So the more you can get away from that, the better. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=465.68s)]
*  And then I just feel like for the NBA, April, May, June, July should be the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  peak months and all of July. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=473.06s)]
*  So one of the things I was looking at, if you moved everything 42 days, but you [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=475.68s)]
*  had a 76 game regular season, so everybody loses three home games, three away games. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  You guys just signed a $76 billion deal. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  You'll be fine. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=488.04s)]
*  Um, that would start the season on December 3rd, but ended on May 11th, 22 [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=489.24s)]
*  weeks, 76 games play in May 13th to May 16th, first three rounds, May 17th to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  July 7th, now we're talking. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=502.12s)]
*  Finals July 10th to July 27th. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  And now all we've done is we've, we've targeted basically post NFL draft. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=509.23999999999995s)]
*  Our three best months of the season. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=515.92s)]
*  We don't have to worry about the NFL at all. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=518.54s)]
*  It's out. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=520.4599999999999s)]
*  And the only thing we'd have to worry about is like the freaking Olympics, but [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=521.42s)]
*  I don't think the NBA player should send our guys to the Olympics anyway. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=524.9s)]
*  So we're fine. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=528.38s)]
*  Um, with that, so I've asked NBA people about this in the past. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=529.54s)]
*  And they said the biggest reason they wouldn't move it is because of the summer [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  schedule, because we need our summers. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  It's the two months off. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=540.3599999999999s)]
*  Our kids are home from school, whatever. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Counter, um, you'd still have August. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=545.5999999999999s)]
*  During July, you're working anyway with the Vegas summer league. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  That's become like a, almost a two week event. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=553.38s)]
*  Um, I would get rid of Vegas summer league completely and use that so [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=556.56s)]
*  that we're done July 27th. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=561.24s)]
*  The draft is July 31st tone down summer league. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=562.84s)]
*  Don't make it this huge thing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=566.84s)]
*  And then you basically get August and September and half of October [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=568.86s)]
*  off before we get the pre. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=573.0s)]
*  That makes way more sense to me. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=574.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=576.72s)]
*  I think it would make way more money too. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=577.28s)]
*  And there's a one word that hasn't come up, which explains why it [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  isn't like this already. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=582.28s)]
*  And that's baseball. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=584.12s)]
*  When the NBA started avoiding baseball on the calendar was that, that era's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=585.64s)]
*  version of avoiding football. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=590.84s)]
*  Now, you know, Mickey Mantle and the Yankees, we can't compete with that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=592.28s)]
*  Like let's, let's start our season right after the world series. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=596.16s)]
*  Like that's, that was the logic. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=599.88s)]
*  This is now an updated version of that where Mickey Mantle and the Yankees [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=601.48s)]
*  is now Patrick Mahomes and the chiefs. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  Um, and one further point, what did Disney just do this week or last couple [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=608.0s)]
*  of weeks is get off of their baseball relationship. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=614.0s)]
*  That's one of the major media partners and they need inventory later [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=616.68s)]
*  into the spring and summer. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  There's no Sunday night baseball anymore. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=622.6s)]
*  Well, let's put, you know, the first round of the playoffs into April, May, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=624.4s)]
*  June, uh, and, and give them more summertime content, uh, for those, those [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=628.68s)]
*  key moments, cause they're also strapped down with football, uh, for the entire [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=634.4s)]
*  fall too. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  Uh, so I think there's a lot of compelling reasons to think about this [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=640.0s)]
*  from a media perspective, uh, and as a league that's trying to gain more [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=643.3199999999999s)]
*  eyeballs and revenue in an attention economy that's increasingly competitive [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=648.28s)]
*  and increasingly in the sports world dominated by both pro football and high [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=653.88s)]
*  level college football in the fall. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=660.36s)]
*  If you're being smart about this, everything moving later also means the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=660.52s)]
*  trade deadline is after the NFL season. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=666.28s)]
*  Your all-star break and all-star game. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  If you have one now that's moving to mid March, maybe even during March [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=671.4s)]
*  madness, maybe you just don't have an all-star game anymore and you just have. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=675.72s)]
*  All-star break is March madness. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=681.64s)]
*  I still love Chris Ryan's idea of having all-star break actually just be [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=683.4s)]
*  bi-weeks with 10 team bi-weeks, three weeks in a row, or each set of 10 [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=687.72s)]
*  teams gets one week off and I would get rid of the all-star game. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=693.0s)]
*  I don't think it works that they want to have some sort of big corporate event. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=695.96s)]
*  Make that the NBA cup whenever you have that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=699.96s)]
*  Um, but the big thing to me that we know we're right is because some of the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=702.6s)]
*  stuff that they're already doing is a reaction to the fact that football [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=707.64s)]
*  is just killing them, right? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=711.8s)]
*  Moving the TNT Barkley show from Thursdays to Tuesdays during the NFL [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=714.28s)]
*  season is a direct concession that you're getting destroyed on Thursday nights. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=720.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=724.12s)]
*  Just period. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=724.52s)]
*  Doing this NBA cup thing is a direct concession that nobody gives a shit [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=726.36s)]
*  about the NBA in late October, November, and December. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=730.6s)]
*  And you need to do something to be like, Hey, we're over here. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  They just need to move it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  And here's the other thing, Kurt Goldsberry, we know expansions come in 32 teams. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=738.76s)]
*  If there's ever a time to go to a 69 game schedule, it's when they do these [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=744.36s)]
*  expansion teams because 32 games, you play the other 31 teams twice. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=748.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=755.4s)]
*  You have four, 18 conference, 18 divisions. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=755.96s)]
*  So you play everybody twice and you play everyone in your vision one more time. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=760.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's 69 games total. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=763.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=765.9599999999999s)]
*  So let's start the season, December 10th. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=766.28s)]
*  Let's end at May 4th. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=769.56s)]
*  Let's play a 20 week season. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=772.04s)]
*  Let's start the plan. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=773.8s)]
*  May 6th and May 9th. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=774.76s)]
*  Let's play the first three rounds, May 10th to June 30th. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=776.04s)]
*  And let's start the finals, July 3rd and on July 20th with a 69 game schedule. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=778.6s)]
*  There's no fucking way you can tell me that's not going to be better for the NBA. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=783.72s)]
*  If attention is good, then that's better. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=786.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think the other thing you mentioned in there is like make the NBA [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=789.3199999999999s)]
*  Cup the all-star game right after the Super Bowl. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=792.3599999999999s)]
*  That's our welcome back to the NBA moment for football. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=797.7199999999999s)]
*  It's such a great format. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=797.88s)]
*  Shout out to the NBA for adding that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=800.3599999999999s)]
*  It really makes those meaningful one game events that the NFL has taught us are so great. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=802.5999999999999s)]
*  But the NBA Cup is a winning addition to the calendar. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=809.8s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=813.8s)]
*  I think we could survive in July. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=814.6s)]
*  I don't know about summer league in August. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  That's a tricky part. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=820.52s)]
*  There will be people who are annoyed. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=821.88s)]
*  Just have it for the don't make it as big of a thing as it was and just make it like [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=824.2s)]
*  if you're going to do a counter on this, the hardest thing to figure out is the college [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  season ends kids graduate, but you wouldn't be able to have the draft until July and end of July. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=833.0s)]
*  So none of those kids would know where they're playing, who they're working out for, for [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=838.52s)]
*  an extra six weeks. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=842.6s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  Maybe you have the draft between the regular season and playoffs. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=846.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=850.0400000000001s)]
*  But that's the only part I can figure out. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=851.24s)]
*  Well, so the let's say, you know, early April college season ends, you know, if we're not [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=853.96s)]
*  starting until December, who cares if the draft is not till the August or whatever. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=859.4s)]
*  I think that's fine. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=864.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=865.32s)]
*  Those kids are all working out on themselves. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=867.32s)]
*  Screw the rookies. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=867.8000000000001s)]
*  So just, I'm going to go through this one more time. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=868.6s)]
*  69 game regular season. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=872.44s)]
*  Once we have 32 teams starts December 10th, ends May 4th. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=874.12s)]
*  We could even say we'll give everyone next week. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=877.72s)]
*  We'll start May 11th, but let's say May 4th, the playoffs are done. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=880.2s)]
*  First three rounds on June 30th finals goes July 3rd, right before July 4th, which would be cool. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=884.12s)]
*  Through July 20th and we're done on July 20th. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=890.84s)]
*  We're done on July 20th. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=893.8s)]
*  So we basically, if you shorten the season and then move it and it's a month longer, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=895.0s)]
*  and now I'm concentrating all my best stuff in May, June, July, that's how you win. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=900.5999999999999s)]
*  This is how they have to think. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=905.0s)]
*  If they don't start thinking this way, I'm going to really start thinking that they need [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=906.52s)]
*  the leadership at the top. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  I know they got this giant media deal, but these are easy fixes that they should do. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=910.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, and the other thing that I think is starting to percolate out, there's this [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=916.68s)]
*  rumor of alternate leagues coming around. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=919.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=922.28s)]
*  It's not a rumor anymore. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=922.84s)]
*  It's not a rumor anymore. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=924.84s)]
*  And I wonder, you know, in an era where live golf came in and the Saudi soccer thing came [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=926.2s)]
*  in, if the league keeps jamming us up with 82 games and making it such a slog, if they [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=932.2800000000001s)]
*  don't show some concession to the athletes or the players, are they making these rival [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=939.72s)]
*  league potentials more attractive to some of their talent around? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=946.52s)]
*  And you can call me crazy all you want. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=951.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying if you follow soccer or golf, you've just seen this. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=952.84s)]
*  Those things weren't going to be real until they were. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=957.4000000000001s)]
*  I think there's a real chance the NBA needs to be proactive here. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=960.5200000000001s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=963.88s)]
*  Keep being proactive. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=965.24s)]
*  Don't be reactive here. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=966.84s)]
*  There's a chance to make the NBA better. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=968.36s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers, I think it was Laker Celtics biggest broadcast of the [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=970.2s)]
*  year. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=973.6400000000001s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=973.96s)]
*  When did that happen? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=974.9200000000001s)]
*  After the NFL. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=976.12s)]
*  If you put that game on a wild card Saturday, you're done. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  Nobody watches that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=982.52s)]
*  And you put it instead in March and here we have 5 million people watching it on American [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=983.8000000000001s)]
*  television. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=989.0s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=990.04s)]
*  That's the kind of incremental improvement we could ramp up across the business if we [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=991.08s)]
*  got out of the way of football. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=998.36s)]
*  Well, one of the cool things that your students did, I mean, there's all this anecdotal evidence [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1000.84s)]
*  we have anyway that football is just destroying everyone else and that it's an absolute monster. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1004.68s)]
*  But then the college football piece, not just NFL, where college football really crests [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1009.4s)]
*  from the end of August, mid November probably. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  And then we start getting it. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1019.0s)]
*  So it's probably mid November range. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1020.28s)]
*  So you're going against two monoliths every weekend. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1022.12s)]
*  I just don't know why you would do that if you don't have to. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1026.76s)]
*  The only thing, my big takeaway is, and I didn't really think about it until I was in [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1030.2s)]
*  your class, it makes zero sense to start on October 22nd, October 23rd, anywhere in [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1033.96s)]
*  October. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1039.8s)]
*  It's stupid. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1040.3600000000001s)]
*  They shouldn't do it anymore. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1041.4s)]
*  And if they want to move it to mid November, even that makes more sense. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1042.92s)]
*  But first week of December makes the most sense and they just have to start thinking [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1048.44s)]
*  that way. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  And I really think if you're just trying to get basketball, NBA, Nirvana for how a season [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  should go, it should be 69 games. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1058.44s)]
*  It should start in December and it should end in July. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1061.16s)]
*  And they're going to win if they do that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1063.64s)]
*  So one of the people at the NBA told me is like, you know, we came up with the NBA [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1065.8000000000002s)]
*  Cup as a way to sort of help the owners compensate for a loss of regular season inventory. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1069.4s)]
*  And when confronted with the idea, hey, let's go down to 70 games or 74 games. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1075.48s)]
*  We're going to add this in season property to compensate for that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1079.96s)]
*  We'll sell it to a media partner. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1083.8000000000002s)]
*  The owners, of course, came back with, well, why don't we do 82 games and the end season [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1085.4s)]
*  tournament and not lose any money? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1089.96s)]
*  So I think somebody needs to do a better job of convincing owners and players that [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1092.2s)]
*  somehow we're going to make the same amount of total revenue if we drop the games to 70, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1097.48s)]
*  69, whatever we decide. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1103.64s)]
*  Because right now that's the case that has failed to make it across the table and land [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1105.32s)]
*  with the owners. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1110.68s)]
*  And that's the simple reason why we still have 82 games. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1111.32s)]
*  Hey, I have a question. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1114.2s)]
*  How much fucking revenue do you need? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1115.64s)]
*  We're going to have guys making $75 billion a year. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1118.28s)]
*  Like how much is enough? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1121.08s)]
*  You just signed a $76 billion deal. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  Like do what's best for the sport, try to grow the sport. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1125.48s)]
*  And this is the best way to do it. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1129.0s)]
*  You mentioned the alternative league. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1130.6s)]
*  So it's being pushed by Matt Ricardo, who's LeBron, one of his business guys. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1132.9199999999998s)]
*  And when I heard about it, I thought it was, I just thought it was bullshit because I didn't [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1137.56s)]
*  think it was real because I thought initially everyone thought those guys were getting the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1144.1999999999998s)]
*  Vegas team. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1148.04s)]
*  And then I think it's wide open. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1149.64s)]
*  I don't think they have any inside track at all. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1152.6000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, there's other groups that I would bet on before them. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1154.44s)]
*  And I thought this was a ploy by them to pretend they're doing raising salary money and blah, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1157.72s)]
*  blah, blah. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1162.92s)]
*  And ultimately, all right, we'll drop it if we get the Vegas team. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1163.48s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  They have got a shitload of money for this and a plan. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1167.5600000000002s)]
*  And everything I've heard is that it's kind of real. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1171.8s)]
*  I don't know if they have all the money yet, but they have enough that [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1175.8s)]
*  could you form a 16 league and convince five, six, seven stars to basically jump [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1179.5600000000002s)]
*  when their contracts? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1185.96s)]
*  I think the contracts would have to be over. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1187.0800000000002s)]
*  But I look at Luca, he's down in 26. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1188.76s)]
*  That's somebody like, all right, could this be a live situation? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  What does he carry? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1195.5600000000002s)]
*  Isn't that being loyal to the NBA? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1196.28s)]
*  He just got traded. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1197.64s)]
*  So could you build a league and have six, seven Luca type guys? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1198.8400000000001s)]
*  Hey, Luca, here's $100 million a year. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1203.64s)]
*  You're playing a 35 game season. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1205.5600000000002s)]
*  And you're going to be the face of one of the faces league. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1208.12s)]
*  I think it's real. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1211.8s)]
*  And I think the NBA owners are a little more worried about it than I think has [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1212.6799999999998s)]
*  been reported so far. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1216.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1217.56s)]
*  Imagine a world where you get paid more money to play less basketball and travel [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1217.8s)]
*  around the world. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1222.36s)]
*  Less basketball. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1222.9199999999998s)]
*  Way less basketball, right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  Imagine a world where you're paid more money to play less basketball, travel [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1225.1599999999999s)]
*  around the world. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1229.0s)]

*  The thing that they couldn't decide to just do that with basketball is nuts. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1279.64s)]
*  Basketball is legitimately a global sport now in the NBA. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1285.08s)]

*  And so I think that makes it even more attractive to somebody to come through [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1309.4s)]
*  and try to disrupt it because you know what? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1312.92s)]

*  TITO You mentioned that it's a global game. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1323.24s)]
*  They also have players that I think unlike with some of the golfers, you have players [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1325.32s)]
*  that have huge social media footprints that if they switch leagues or did something else, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1330.68s)]
*  they'd actually be able to promote themselves. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1337.0s)]
*  I remember when my contract was almost up with ESPN and it seemed like [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1340.04s)]
*  people thought I was going to leave and they were writing about it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1345.72s)]

*  were able to leave and start stuff. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1354.84s)]
*  And it's like, you don't need the fucking machine. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1356.28s)]
*  I don't think the basketball players need the machine. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1358.28s)]
*  I think if they were part of another league, I think people would pay attention to it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1360.84s)]

*  There's all these solutions that they're unwilling to explore. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1424.8400000000001s)]
*  They're going to add two teams and somehow keep an 82 game schedule, which is stupid. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1427.88s)]
*  And they have all this money that they already got that allows them now the luxury to rethink [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1432.8400000000001s)]
*  this whole system. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1438.8400000000001s)]

*  And if they're not thinking that way, they need new people to run the league. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1440.92s)]
*  TITO And one last one last point about the 82 games. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1443.24s)]

*  Load management. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1448.68s)]
*  If you look at the data, load management really annoys fans. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1449.88s)]
*  People don't want to turn on TNT like we did for that Celtics Sixers game the other night [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1453.0800000000002s)]
*  and see the main red claws in the Delaware 87ers. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1457.56s)]
*  One of the reasons that happens is we're putting too many games out there. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1461.24s)]
*  If we had fewer games, there'd be fewer load management situations. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1465.56s)]
*  We would have full teams playing each other. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1469.96s)]
*  The product would be better on average. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1473.0s)]
*  Well, you'd also have a situation like Philly is now punted on their season. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1476.04s)]
*  You don't have to watch the Zombie Sixers for the next two months. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzI6yVPMgWk&t=1480.04s)]
