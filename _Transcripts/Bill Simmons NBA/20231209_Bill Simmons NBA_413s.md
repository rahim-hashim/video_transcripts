# Haliburton Is Shooting Up the NBA Rankings | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b4GaWIFR_s)
*  just where is Hal Burton at?
*  Like we did the ringer NBA list.
*  I think I picked him 11th.
*  It's really hard for me to put him behind
*  Devin Booker at this point.
*  I know Devin Booker's been to finals.
*  I know Devin Booker's awesome.
*  What I watched from Hal Burton today
*  against a team that has Giannis and Lopez
*  that threw different defensive looks at him,
*  that put him in zones,
*  the way he's able to keep the pace,
*  the way he's able to close these games
*  he did against Boston, he did against Milwaukee,
*  I don't even know what guard historically
*  to compare him to was watching in person.
*  I think what was the most shocking to me
*  was just how fucking fast he is.
*  It's not just like pushing the pace,
*  but like, man, he can go zero to 60 in the half court.
*  And over and over again,
*  we were joking about it with Malik Beasley
*  in the first quarter.
*  He just eight times in a row just went by him.
*  But then he had another gear for the fourth quarter.
*  I know, I know Rob, this is your guy.
*  He hates Malik Beasley.
*  Do you guys think Tyrese even knew
*  that Malik Beasley was in the building?
*  Maybe he just went the whole night without seeing it.
*  No, it was like they picked a fan from the stands.
*  They're like, you're gonna guard Tyrese Hal Burton
*  for the first quarter.
*  Was, did he seem faster to you in person than you thought?
*  It's not just, obviously there's the speed with the ball,
*  but for me, what's fastest is his decision making.
*  How quickly he decides to get off of it.
*  When it's time to get off of it, the hitter heads.
*  When he's on the pick and roll,
*  the fastness with which he's gonna whip a pocket pass.
*  His decision making is very quick too.
*  It's not just that he's on the ball
*  just moving at a whirlwind pace.
*  And so, man, that was just really cool to see tonight.
*  One, the fact that Beasley couldn't do anything with him.
*  And he treated Beasley as if he was a traffic cone.
*  And then they zoned him up
*  and he started picking apart the zone as well.
*  That was a moment where I think the Bucks
*  started smartly playing Halliburton to shoot.
*  Because his inclination is to get his guys involved
*  and not be ball hogging and score.
*  It's the old Steve Nash Jedi mind trick of,
*  hey, go ahead, take some shots.
*  And then he said, hold on, these people think I can't score?
*  And he proceeded to just keep getting buckets.
*  So it was just an incredible, incredible game to watch.
*  Now as far as the pecking order,
*  obviously I think he's a clearly all-star, starter,
*  level kind of guy. He's first team
*  on the NBA right now, right?
*  I don't see how the guard list starts without him first.
*  Well, thankfully we don't have to do by position anymore.
*  So it's just going to be five guys, first team.
*  I'm doing it by position.
*  I'm not listening to their instructions.
*  Of course.
*  They can fuck off on that.
*  They threw away 75 years of history.
*  They're like, oh no, everybody gets a position down.
*  It's like, go to hell.
*  If you're picking two guards,
*  right now you've got Steph, you've got Luca,
*  you've got Shay, you've got Tyrese Halliburton.
*  Oh, we're counting, I forgot.
*  We have to count Luca as a guard,
*  even though he's 6'8", 270.
*  He plays point guard.
*  So it's Luca and Halliburton then.
*  I mean, that's brutal.
*  Like Shay with the season he's having
*  is not first team all-in-BA.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's tough. That's what it might be.
*  But I think Halliburton's been at their level, man.
*  You gotta talk about leadership, raising,
*  elevating the guys on your team.
*  He's been the number one guy.
*  Rob, the thing that,
*  what Waz talked about, the decision-making,
*  it reminds me of what they talk about with,
*  and you're in the Bay, so you appreciate this,
*  with the Brock Purdy conversation about
*  how he processes things just fast.
*  Okay, you need to catch me up on the Brock Purdy conversation
*  because I used my one,
*  I know two things about football, I said one.
*  Rob is the one texting who doesn't know.
*  Rob, just nod.
*  But Brock Purdy's like, kinda,
*  it seems like average physical skills for a quarterback,
*  but just, he just, right away,
*  he just kinda knows where the ball should go and fast.
*  And what was fascinating with Halliburton today is
*  the Bucks couldn't keep up with the speed
*  of how fast he made decisions.
*  He's going over half court and he's already like,
*  I'm gonna go by Beasley on the right,
*  and then I'm gonna cut across,
*  and then I'm gonna swing it in the corner.
*  And he's already figured it out before he's done it.
*  And the Bucks were just constantly going backwards.
*  They have their own issues anyway,
*  with Dave, literally nobody on the roster
*  who can guard somebody like that.
*  But he eviscerated them,
*  and he did the fucking dame time thing,
*  which I'm sure blew up on social.
*  He did, not only did he look at the watch,
*  he milked it, he was like, time, time,
*  he's just going nuts.
*  He was having a great time with that.
*  Yeah, this was like some alpha shit he was doing.
*  So anyway, we had a look on TV.
*  Much the same, and I think not only is it the speed
*  of decision making that you guys are talking about,
*  but how quickly he learns within the games.
*  It's not just on an individual possession,
*  but I think the biggest point of contrast on this front
*  is in the first half,
*  when he got Lopez or Giannis switched on him,
*  he was pulling up for like 30 footers.
*  And those are shots he can hit,
*  and some days he will hit them.
*  They weren't quite going in this one.
*  But when he got Lopez again down the stretch in crunch time,
*  he sold that 30 footer and then blew by him for a layup.
*  And that's the kind of thing you can see him doing
*  all game long, man versus zone,
*  different kinds of coverages, as you were saying,
*  while it's like no matter what you throw at him,
*  he's gonna be better at tackling it in the fourth quarter
*  than he is in the first.
*  And that is fucking terrifying.
*  I do they keep the stat of just I just drove by the guy
*  who was trying to guard me?
*  That sounds like that should be a second spectrum.
*  Scott, I call it that blow buys.
*  They have that stat in soccer.
*  Like when you when you beat a guy off the dribble,
*  like that's a stat that they keep.
*  The NBA probably should should keep that too.
*  But yeah, the Beasley thing was funny, Rob,
*  because I'm watching him in pregame warmups
*  and he's doing like these crazy foot fires.
*  And in my head, I'm like, I wonder if like this is something
*  he does every game.
*  I've never watched this guy warm up.
*  I've never paid attention to it.
*  And then I'm just like, oh, like he's like,
*  I'm about to guard Halliburton all day.
*  And I need to get my foot speed.
*  And he was trying to do like like like shit starting
*  like Beasley stuff.
*  Like, you know, there's a timeout and he's got to like
*  try to block the shot if somebody's going to take the action.
*  None of it was working.
*  The soccer thing is a good analogy because the way
*  he goes by people reminds me of those guys in soccer
*  that could just beat anybody and go by them and do scissor kicks
*  and just shit like that.
*  We're like, oh, that guy in open space, he's going by,
*  you know, like almost messy like.
*  But I can't say enough about it.
*  That was one of the best games I've seen a guard play.
*  No turnovers. Yeah.
*  And he never turns it over.
*  In either of these tournament games between the two games,
*  53 points, 28 assists, 17 rebounds, zero turnovers.
