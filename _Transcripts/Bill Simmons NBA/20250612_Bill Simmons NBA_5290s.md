# Pacers Do It Again, Plus Trade Buzz From Indiana With Zach Lowe | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw)
*  All right, Zach low. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=0.0s)]
*  It is 1143 Eastern time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=27.6s)]
*  We are in Indianapolis, Indiana, a wonderful place. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=31.64s)]
*  I had a great time today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=34.44s)]
*  Everybody's super friendly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=35.92s)]
*  People love this Pacers team. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=37.38s)]
*  There was a sense of, boy, it'd be adorable if they could just get a couple of punches in. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  We kind of know where this series is going. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=45.56s)]
*  On the third quarter, I started to get flashbacks to the 2011 finals when I was in Dallas, a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=48.24s)]
*  Dallas team that did not make a lot of sense. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=55.76s)]
*  And they're playing Miami first year of LeBron, Wade Bosch, just waiting for Miami to finish them off. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=59.12s)]
*  And there was a point with the crowd and the energy and shots are going in and defensive plays where you kind of go, huh, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=64.96s)]
*  what's going on here? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=73.68s)]
*  And Indiana wins and they're up two games to one. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=75.2s)]
*  They're two games away from the 2025 NBA title. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Zach low. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you this right now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=83.0s)]
*  I was at Pacers practice yesterday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=84.68s)]
*  I've been around the Pacers a lot in the last three weeks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=86.12s)]
*  The, the whole like, we're playing with house money thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=90.4s)]
*  It'd be nice if we got a punch or two in. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=94.56s)]
*  None of that is filtered into them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=97.0s)]
*  They're like, oh yeah, we can, we can win. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=99.04s)]
*  Like we're, we're as good as this team. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  We can beat this team. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=102.68s)]
*  Like none of that is, is applying to them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=103.56s)]
*  And I, you know, the whole discussion in the last 48, 72 hours has been, I've seen like a million stories you've talked about with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Ryan, where does this team rank? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=113.6s)]
*  And like, it's the most unusual potential champion, the most unusual finalists, you know, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=115.52s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, preseason odds. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=119.44s)]
*  It's time to start just shifting the discussion to something happened. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=121.88s)]
*  And this is now a championship level team because regardless of what happens from here on out, they are up to one in the NBA finals over a 68 win team. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=126.88s)]
*  And that game tonight didn't feel fluky. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=136.12s)]
*  It felt like two teams trading punches, a little ugly, a little grimy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=139.16s)]
*  People got tired. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Some bad shots were taken, some tough defensive possessions that were inflicted by both teams and they made enough big plays. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=144.32s)]
*  The bench was unbelievable, but like the most unusual thing, like that's cool. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=151.28s)]
*  It's, it's going to be good trivia whether they win or lose, but like something happened to this team and they're just this good. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=155.48s)]
*  First half, the basketball was about as high level as you're going to get for a game three of the finals. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=162.72s)]
*  Usually it takes a couple of games. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=169.4s)]
*  That was like a game four, game five level. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=171.44s)]
*  It's like, oh, they're going toe to toe. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=174.32s)]
*  They're doing all the, the benches are coming in and actually making an impact. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=176.16s)]
*  They're running really smart offense. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=179.56s)]
*  They're attacking the other side. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=180.88s)]
*  Like they've seen them for a bunch of games. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  I was halftime. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  I was just really impressed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=185.72s)]
*  Like talking to the people in my section, Tommy came over. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=186.72s)]
*  They were just like, that was just good basketball game. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=190.12s)]
*  Tommy Alter? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Tommy Alter stopped by. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=192.72s)]
*  Just ubiquitous. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  Wearing a roots of fight jacket. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  Just super happy to be in Indiana. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=196.36s)]
*  Third quarter starts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=198.52s)]
*  Six, they'll run thunder. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=200.6s)]
*  Boom. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=201.76s)]
*  And okay. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=202.27999999999997s)]
*  C comes out with, with some real physicality and some swagger. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=202.72s)]
*  And it was like, all right, that was cute. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  That'll that was a fun run by an end and just felt like it was going to go the way of all these other okay. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=211.0s)]
*  C games. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=215.32s)]
*  And once again, they climbed out of the hole. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  Halberton was great. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=219.2s)]
*  I don't want to do the Halberton stepped up thing because I thought that was the worst storyline of the week. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  And I thought it was a fundamental misunderstanding of who Haliburton is as a player, a guy who takes 13 to 14 shots a game. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=226.6s)]
*  Who averages 19 and nine during the season and 19 and nine in the playoffs. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  He is who he is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=238.32s)]
*  This is Steve Nash in the mid 2000s was like this Chris Paul in the late 2000s and 2010s were like this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=239.52s)]
*  These guys are not built to score 20, take 20, 22 shots a game. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  They're not 30 point scores. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=251.12s)]
*  They make everyone else better. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=253.52s)]
*  That's the whole point of having them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=254.6s)]
*  They set the tone. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=255.84s)]
*  They drive the car. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=257.4s)]
*  You want to put them in an awesome car and let them do their thing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=258.92s)]
*  With that said, I thought he was a little more aggressive in the first half. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=262.24s)]
*  No question. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=266.08s)]
*  He clearly was like, I can't let whatever happened last game happen again. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=266.56s)]
*  So he took a couple of shots that weren't even great shots, but it was just, he was trying to get in the paint and he was trying to take more stuff. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=270.56s)]
*  But I thought he wasn't just awesome on offense. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=277.24s)]
*  His hands were everywhere on defense. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=279.72s)]
*  I don't know how many balls he touched, deflected, stole, but it felt like he was all over the place. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=281.64s)]
*  Yeah, he had a pick six against Shea. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=288.16s)]
*  Shea had a couple of bad pass turnovers that went the other way. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=290.6s)]
*  Six turnovers for Shea. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=293.12s)]
*  Indiana wins the turnover battle. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=295.04s)]
*  That's step one to having any chance of beating the Thunder is like not just not lose it by too much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=297.16s)]
*  They want it like Halliburton. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=302.8s)]
*  I remember a long two he took over at SGA in the first half. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=304.68s)]
*  That was clearly just like an ISO like an A-wombadimu more aggressive. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=308.24s)]
*  This is like I got to take this shot. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=311.12s)]
*  He took a couple of threes where he just kind of pulled up like in like before using a screen or in between a switch. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=313.24s)]
*  Like I got a little window. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=318.76s)]
*  I got to take it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=319.88s)]
*  Like I can't afford not to not to take it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=320.48s)]
*  But the other stat is he was great. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=322.72s)]
*  Halliburton was awesome. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=325.04s)]
*  Police Sergeant. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=326.56s)]
*  I wonder if people can hear the police sirens. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=327.44s)]
*  It's quite a scene walking from the arena to your hotel. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=329.2s)]
*  I would describe it as somewhere between joyous and euphoric. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=331.8s)]
*  It was like you it was the kind of scene I've seen when it's 3-1 and your team's on the verge of winning. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=335.32s)]
*  Like there was a kid hanging out of a moving car. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=341.76s)]
*  There was a guy in a Larry Bird Indiana State jersey just running around yelling police were high fiving people. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  It was great. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  Anyway Halliburton was awesome. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  Twenty two eleven and nine cared more about his stats. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=353.96s)]
*  Got to chase that 10th rebound. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=356.4s)]
*  You know it's come on. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Terence Halburn you got to step up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=359.12s)]
*  Get the triple double man. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=360.59999999999997s)]

*  And they had been getting destroyed in the non Halliburton minutes which are also the non SGA minutes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=404.72s)]
*  In the first two games and they won those minutes decisively tonight. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=410.52s)]
*  We know why. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=413.48s)]
*  The bench guys. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=414.08s)]
*  Matherin. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=414.72s)]
*  McConnell. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=415.6s)]
*  Toppin. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=416.44s)]
*  Big fourth quarter for him. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=417.12s)]
*  Those guys were plus 16 plus 12 plus 18. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=418.6s)]
*  Two by the way two guys in Toppin and Matherin. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=421.32s)]
*  That had been the subject of well if the Pacers ever need to duck the luxury tax or cut their tax bills. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=424.24s)]
*  Like you can just dump those guys. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=428.76s)]
*  Dump those guys. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=430.2s)]
*  They just won you an NBA finals game against a 68 win team. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=431.56s)]
*  There's no dumping. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=435.08s)]
*  No dumps will be taken with those guys. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=436.0s)]
*  Well the Pacers bench. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  What was it. 32 24. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  And. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=442.44s)]
*  They come in. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  TJ starts doing the TJ thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=445.0s)]
*  They start pressing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=447.64s)]
*  He gets a steal. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  Whatever goes out of bounds. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=450.44s)]
*  He does the thing where he goes to the side. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=451.64s)]
*  Hulks up in front of everybody. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=454.08s)]
*  And it was another supercharged thing for the crowd. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=455.68s)]
*  Because they know like they need the energy from those guys. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=458.36s)]
*  I said to you on Thursday even though Matherin was terrible. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  I said there's something comfortable to me out there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=465.36s)]
*  There was something athletically comfortable for him. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=469.48s)]
*  And I was thinking today about just in general watching the game. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=472.56s)]
*  They have all these Canadians out there who have all known each other forever. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=475.6s)]
*  You know. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=478.96s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons Nemhard. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=479.36s)]
*  I don't think anyone can really guard SGA, but he's probably looked the best. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=481.56s)]
*  Doing it because he's been playing against him since what they were 12. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=485.56s)]
*  He's just not afraid of him. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=489.36s)]
*  And he knows all his moves. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  He doesn't fall for his herky jerky thing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  He's just kind of always there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=493.68s)]
*  And then, you know, Matherin isn't afraid of anybody. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=495.88000000000005s)]
*  He's the most irrational confidence guy you get. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=498.16s)]
*  And then you flip it on the other side when we were talking about, um, you know, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=500.6s)]
*  okay, see looking a little young. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  They don't have that one guy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  And again, we're nitpicking. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=508.56s)]
*  I think that seems great. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=509.68s)]
*  They don't have that one like crazy Matherin, he checked. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=510.68s)]
*  Let me carry us for four minutes guy. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=514.04s)]
*  It's the MVP. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=517.28s)]
*  That's who it is. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=518.2s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=519.16s)]
*  It's SGA and JLIM, but they don't have the random eighth guy that comes off the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=520.12s)]
*  bench and does whatever. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=523.8s)]
*  But so I'm trying to think like, if I'm Indiana, what am I taking away from that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  game? Big picture because okay, so look young. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  We covered that piece. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=533.84s)]
*  Um, and they know that they can pressure them. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=535.16s)]
*  They know that they can at least stay in the vicinity of guarding SGA. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  What are like, what are the other big takeaways for you? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  Um, I think they could take away number one that Halliburton found the right [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=546.0s)]
*  balance and how he needs to play and is going to is growing comfortable more in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=551.04s)]
*  this series to the point that like, I wonder if we see some adjustments from the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=555.0s)]
*  thunder defensively on him. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=557.96s)]
*  Uh, I thought Indiana's defense minus their bigs are still having issues in the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=560.44s)]
*  pick and roll against Shea. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=566.64s)]
*  Um, I thought they amped up the pressure in the second half. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  They started blitzing them a little bit more and like Mick just mixed in different [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=571.48s)]
*  stuff, but minus those kinds of breakdowns where Shea would fake toward a screen and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=574.52s)]
*  go the other way. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=578.72s)]
*  And miles Turner would be like, where'd you go? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=579.32s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=580.6s)]
*  And there'd be a layup or JDub same thing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=581.08s)]
*  Got him a couple of times. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=583.36s)]
*  Their defense was really good. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=584.6800000000001s)]
*  And actually one of the reasons I'm interested to go back and watch this game [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=585.88s)]
*  is an insanely low three point volume game for both teams in 2025, 27 threes for [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=588.36s)]
*  the Pacers, only 22 threes for the thunder. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=595.88s)]
*  Like you don't see games anymore where neither team gets 33. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=598.84s)]
*  So they were able to take away, not take away, but limit as J a little bit, make [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=602.92s)]
*  it tough for him without giving up. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=607.72s)]
*  Like, like, can you, Wallace may have had one in the corner that was an awful [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=609.92s)]
*  miss, like a lot of their threes were contested tough threes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=614.28s)]
*  Like it was a, for, for a team whose defense is it's a like slight limitation. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=618.36s)]
*  They they've played a pretty good defensive series, like minus those [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=623.4s)]
*  breakdowns and just that, just that the bench is the bench is ready for even Ben [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=625.72s)]
*  Shepard, those 18 minutes from Ben Shepard are big, like competent minutes. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=630.36s)]
*  Like, right. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=635.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=636.4s)]
*  He was, he was at least staying with SGA. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=636.76s)]
*  It wasn't like he was shutting him down. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=639.84s)]
*  We can, there's no, like we could not possibly say enough about McConnell and [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=641.0s)]
*  Matheran, like they deserve like 10 minutes of this podcast. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=645.48s)]
*  They were so good. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=649.84s)]
*  Well, so when I said to you, the, I think I said that I could see him having 27 [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=651.0s)]
*  and 20 minutes, how many minutes did he play? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=655.96s)]
*  Probably more than 20. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=658.4s)]
*  And he had 27 points. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=661.36s)]
*  And the only one that I felt like he couldn't really do anything against [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=662.12s)]
*  cause nobody can is Dort and he was, he would try to get switches to get away [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=665.6s)]
*  from Dort so he could attack, but it felt like he was comfortable against everybody [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=669.88s)]
*  else. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=672.76s)]
*  So I wrote down, it was OKC 90 to 84 right after that, Jalen Williams hit that big [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=672.96s)]
*  three at the end of the third quarter. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=679.56s)]
*  Ooh, that was a killer. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=682.28s)]
*  And I wrote down, that was an oh, for the rest of the decade moment, because that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=682.88s)]
*  was one of those, I got it guys. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  And you know, so I wrote down a bunch of stats cause there was three minutes there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=689.56s)]
*  Indy had five turnovers in that quarter. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=694.0s)]
*  They had seven in the first quarter, none in the second quarter when they played [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  well. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=699.7199999999999s)]
*  Indy was six for 22 from three after three quarters and Turner was two for 10 [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  and minus 15 and OKC was plus nine in rebound. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=705.5999999999999s)]
*  So every single stat was looking good for OKC. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=709.0s)]
*  Indy wasn't playing well except for, for Halliburton and the bench guys when they [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=711.88s)]
*  came in and then they swung it and I'm like you, I want to watch that tape again. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=715.04s)]
*  It felt like the big things that swung were, um, Halliburton made a couple of big [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=719.32s)]
*  plays. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=723.16s)]
*  SGA looked, what's the word you would use? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=724.72s)]
*  I, I thought frazzled? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=728.64s)]
*  You know, a wee frazzled? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=731.16s)]
*  I just thought they're often, and this is if the thunder had, there is no [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=734.2s)]
*  weakness, but if the thunder have a weakness that we've seen or a limitation [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=737.96s)]
*  that we've seen in a few of these games is that their offense can just sort of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  default into like, okay, we're just not going to pass. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=746.9200000000001s)]
*  Like I'm just going to do everything by myself and JDub and Shea both had a lot [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=749.52s)]
*  of those down the stretch, some successful, some not. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=753.24s)]
*  I think they had 16 assists on what 37 baskets or something today. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=755.48s)]
*  I mean, that's a somewhat alarming number and it's telling to me that after [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=760.96s)]
*  every time out, if you go chart their out of time out plays in this game, almost [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=765.92s)]
*  every one was some kind of like really heavily scripted set, like set piece [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=770.6s)]
*  where SGA would set a back screen for home grand or SGA would set it like [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=775.96s)]
*  almost like warrior Z off ball stuff. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=780.2s)]
*  And it's Dagnall trying to be like, let's get some stuff going here. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=782.64s)]
*  But then when the going gets tough and the game gets into the muck and it's at [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=787.08s)]
*  the end and, and the Pacers contested those shots pretty well, even them heart, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=790.36s)]
*  like they, she would shove them off a little bit and them heart would just be [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  like, I got shoved. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=797.28s)]
*  I'm not going to give up on the play. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=798.56s)]
*  And they didn't panic. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=799.8s)]
*  And did you notice okay. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  So he was doing that there didn't to knee Smith too. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  They were really physical drives. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=805.8s)]
*  I mean, JDub is a tank, man. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=808.28s)]
*  I felt like the whole, the first quarter in the third quarter, especially [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=810.24s)]
*  okay. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=814.0s)]
*  So he came out with, with a little bit of a physical swagger. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  Like we're a stronger team than this team. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=818.6s)]
*  Let's let's punish these guys. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=820.64s)]
*  I just wonder if they thought the whole series for Indiana rides on this game. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=822.2800000000001s)]
*  If we can come in here and take this game and go up to one and win, you know, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=828.5200000000001s)]
*  win two straight in series, take back home court advantage, we're going to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  smell blood in the water. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=837.24s)]
*  They're going to be worried. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=838.32s)]
*  We're going to reassert our sort of primacy in the series. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  I wonder if they just came out and like, this is the series for Indiana, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=841.76s)]
*  because this feels obviously way different if it's okay. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=844.88s)]
*  I mean, you know, they were getting like the first game. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=847.72s)]
*  They had the second game, but they had the third game, you know, which is [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=850.36s)]
*  the one where they had a C2 Indiana one. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=852.48s)]
*  And now it's like. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=854.6s)]
*  Now game four is just a perfect awesome game for us to go to. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=855.68s)]
*  Well, and game four is also the way they do this final schedule. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=860.92s)]
*  It's the most interesting game cause it's the one game where you [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=864.9599999999999s)]
*  only have the one day rest. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=867.52s)]
*  And by the way, isn't that awesome because the two days of rest between games, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=868.72s)]
*  one and two, and it's nice they space the finals out. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=872.76s)]
*  You don't, you don't want to overstress the players, but it did feel like [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=874.76s)]
*  Now it's like one day off, the practice is tomorrow. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=877.16s)]
*  Everyone's going to talk. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=879.8s)]
*  We go right back at it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=880.52s)]
*  I was, uh, probably 10 rows behind the OKC bench and I was watching them before the game. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=882.04s)]
*  And I was watching them. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=887.3199999999999s)]
*  They took a big lead the first four or five minutes. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=888.76s)]
*  They were up like 13, six. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=891.4s)]
*  Was there a double digit lead in the game at any time? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=893.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't think there was. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=895.8s)]
*  I thought, yeah, they got to 15, six. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=898.36s)]
*  I think that was the biggest lead and, uh, and shed at eight. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=900.8399999999999s)]
*  Hal Burton hadn't gotten going in any way yet. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=904.92s)]
*  And we were actually wondering how, if he was hurt, cause that was a big topic the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=908.04s)]
*  last day is he hiding some sort of injury. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=911.4s)]
*  He wasn't, he was obviously fine. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=913.0799999999999s)]
*  But in the time out, they're laughing. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=915.0s)]
*  They, all their chests are out. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=918.12s)]
*  They're like doing like, you can kind of tell with benches sometimes how confident a team is. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=919.8s)]
*  Now I sound like body language guy, but I, but in this case, it's legit. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=925.56s)]
*  And it was really funny to watch that kind of demeanor shift over the course of the game. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  By the fourth quarter, there was none, obviously none of that cause they're behind, but it was [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=936.52s)]
*  kind of like almost a little shell shock. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=941.16s)]
*  Nobody was talking. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=943.16s)]
*  There was like Caruso coming in and doing like the come on guys. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  But for the most part, that swagger like got just pulled out of them over the course of two hours. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=947.32s)]
*  Well, and that was, this was like one of those great finals games where [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=951.48s)]
*  it swung back and forth a bunch of times. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=955.88s)]
*  It was like, oh, this team's up for momentum and like immediately the other team would answer. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=957.8s)]
*  Like they just, every, both teams had answers and answers and answers until just the Pacers [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=962.12s)]
*  had a few more answers and then they ran out of ran out of clock. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=966.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=969.16s)]
*  See, missed the free throws that needed to make, to have any chance. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=969.4s)]
*  Caruso didn't get the flagrant call. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=972.3599999999999s)]
*  What did you, what did you think of that foul from like your perspective? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=974.28s)]
*  I think you get that call at okay. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=977.4s)]
*  See, I think you get that call in the regular season. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=978.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, you a hundred percent get it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=981.8s)]
*  If it's a Friday night ESPN game, you get that call. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=983.0799999999999s)]
*  I didn't mind it not being called. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=985.9599999999999s)]
*  I thought he pulled his hand up right after the, right after he hit him. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=987.32s)]
*  Like he didn't like follow through. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=990.0400000000001s)]
*  So that's why I like, I mean, I don't want to belabor it because the game, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=992.44s)]
*  it didn't end up mattering that much, but I, I do think there's some skill in not being so [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=995.1600000000001s)]
*  out of control that you just decapitate someone and knee Smith, like he missed his head. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1001.48s)]
*  He missed his neck. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1005.4000000000001s)]
*  He hit his shoulders, his arms, and didn't like wind up crazily. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1006.2s)]
*  Like that, that he took some precaution to not just kill Alex Caruso in midair. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1009.0s)]
*  The problem is he had no chance on that point. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1014.28s)]
*  He was directly behind him. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1017.48s)]
*  And usually they give the benefit of the doubt to the guy who's ahead because they [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1018.8399999999999s)]
*  don't want those guys to get hurt in those. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1021.88s)]
*  But I was fine with it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1023.3199999999999s)]
*  Can we talk about McConnell and Atherin Moore? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1025.0s)]
*  So yeah, we, we have a bunch of stuff. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1027.3999999999999s)]
*  McConnell had three McConnell's in one NBA finals game. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1029.24s)]
*  He caught an inbounds pass. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1033.0s)]
*  That's a McConnell. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1034.2s)]
*  He says McConnell is an inbound ceiling. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1035.16s)]
*  Got three of them in one. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1037.24s)]
*  I'm like, well, so what's an official McConnell because he jumped up like a [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1038.76s)]
*  defensive end on the football line and stole like a screen pass. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1043.0s)]
*  You know, that's actually interesting. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1047.8s)]
*  Is it a McConnell? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1049.16s)]
*  It's a full McConnell. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1051.16s)]
*  If he, if he, if he grabs the inbounds pass out of the air. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1052.2s)]
*  A full, that's right. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1055.16s)]
*  A full McConnell is if he's the first person to touch an inbounds pass from the other [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1055.88s)]
*  team and he steals the ball. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1059.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1060.84s)]
*  A semi McConnell is they inbound it to another player who catches it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1061.32s)]
*  And then he just takes the ball away. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1065.32s)]
*  That's all different. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1066.68s)]
*  He had three full McConnell's in one game, including 95, 91 in the fourth quarter. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1068.6799999999998s)]
*  Thunder have the ball in there ahead by four. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1075.56s)]
*  Jalen Williams brings the ball over half court, gets pressed a little bit, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1078.36s)]
*  picks up his dribble inexplicably and then like throws a pass to nobody. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1082.76s)]
*  McConnell gets it, goes down the court, misses offensive rebound. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1087.24s)]
*  Nemhar hits a short two. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1091.48s)]
*  It's 95, 93. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1092.6s)]
*  Instantaneous McConnell put back layup 95, 95. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1093.9599999999998s)]
*  It's like, what just happened? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1097.16s)]
*  It could have been a six point game and it's tied in five seconds in a McConnell crowd [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1099.24s)]
*  goes crazy too. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1103.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1104.52s)]
*  There was a few times like they fucked up a few fast breaks. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1104.76s)]
*  McConnell had one where he just was like tearing down. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1108.76s)]
*  It was like a one on four and he just whipped it into the corner. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1111.24s)]
*  They reviewed it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1113.72s)]
*  It was, it was just a bad play, but where it felt like Indiana was about to go up by [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1114.3600000000001s)]
*  eight and every time it felt that way, they would do something dumb. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1119.3200000000002s)]
*  McConnell was, you know, I, we've seen him do this at home. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1122.92s)]
*  Like if you actually watch the Pacers the last couple of years, this is a big [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1126.12s)]
*  part of who they are. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1129.2399999999998s)]
*  Same coming in these home games and swinging the game. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1130.52s)]
*  Mather and hit or miss. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1133.1599999999999s)]
*  She knew he was going to have a game like this at some point. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1134.28s)]
*  Toppin was the revelation for me because there's been times in the playoffs where [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1136.9199999999998s)]
*  he looks unplayable. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1141.0s)]
*  And then there's other times in the playoffs where you go, wow, I can't believe [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1142.6s)]
*  the Knicks just gave him away because they did. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1146.36s)]
*  They, I mean, they needed the seller cap. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1149.08s)]
*  They literally gave him away. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1150.6s)]
*  That follow up, Dunkey had, which I was lucky because it was on my basket and you [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1152.1200000000001s)]
*  could see there was a miss and you could see him timing it from the foul line and [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1158.0400000000002s)]
*  coming up and all of a sudden he was 12 feet. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1161.96s)]
*  And by the way, that was one of the big Carlisle moves of the game. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1164.7600000000002s)]
*  He said see Ockham until I think like three and a half minutes left. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1168.2s)]
*  He rode the top and Turner combination. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1171.5600000000002s)]
*  The big man rotation was sitting. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1173.88s)]
*  See Ockham was pretty bold. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1175.3200000000002s)]
*  Like I don't, well, and it's fitting for the kind of player Pascal. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1176.8400000000001s)]
*  See Ockham is that the first time we mentioned him X minutes into this podcast is about [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1181.48s)]
*  how he wasn't in the game for a lot of the fourth quarter. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1186.0400000000002s)]
*  And all he did was finished with 21, six and four on eight of 14 shooting. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1188.52s)]
*  And just like he just, I've said this to you before. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1192.0400000000002s)]
*  He's like the electric current pulsing through the game. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1194.52s)]
*  You don't notice it all the time, but it's powering them constantly. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1197.16s)]
*  And like, yes, he was on the bench for some of the fourth quarter. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1200.92s)]
*  He still had a great game defensively. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1203.16s)]
*  I thought he was awesome. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1204.52s)]
*  Made a lot of plays on defense. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1205.3200000000002s)]
*  Should have been on the bench for that long. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1206.28s)]
*  Well, I thought it was really risky because I didn't think Turner was good. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1208.1999999999998s)]
*  And ironically, Turner in the last couple of minutes had three straight, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1212.12s)]
*  awesome defensive plays that kind of glitched the game. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1215.7199999999998s)]
*  So that's why he was out there, but he was bad for most of the game. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1218.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, Toppin, you know, he has it's 105, 100. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1220.84s)]
*  I just, I'm not doing this from straight memory, but I just look at the play by play. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1225.8s)]
*  105, 100. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1229.3999999999999s)]
*  Dort misses a wide open corner three to bring it to within two. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1230.36s)]
*  What are the way I thought that was going in? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1234.28s)]
*  I didn't, I mean, anything blue door touch for the first three quarters of the game. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1238.36s)]
*  Where I think every shot he's taking is going in. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1242.04s)]
*  Toppin got what will go as an unheralded, really good contested defensive rebound. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1244.9199999999998s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1251.1599999999999s)]
*  So defensive rebound by Toppin, immediate offensive putback dunk by Toppin on a Halliburton miss. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1251.7199999999998s)]
*  And then Toppin switches onto JDub on the next possession and blocks him at the rim. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1258.6s)]
*  Three incredible Toppin plays in 45 seconds to swing the game from like [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1263.24s)]
*  really in the balance of that door three goes in or they get an offensive rebound or something [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1268.52s)]
*  to Indiana is now in full control of the game going down the stretch. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1272.1200000000001s)]
*  He's a classic nice guy to have in a playoff home game with an awesome crowd. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1276.28s)]
*  I mean, that putback dunk was. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1282.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, it was like that for the, for the Souths, Robert Williams was like that. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1283.4s)]
*  There's certain guys who are just like great playoff home game guys. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1287.0s)]
*  I actually thought about Robert Williams today for some reason during a meeting I had with [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1290.84s)]
*  somebody and we're, I was talking about a center that I was thinking about centers that can rim [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1295.9599999999998s)]
*  run and pass and how rare that combination is and how it looks like Robert Lord was going to be [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1301.08s)]
*  one of those guys. And now it's like, where is he? What's happening? Anyway, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1305.56s)]
*  I allowed myself to think of the Celtics today as I was walking to the, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1309.8799999999999s)]
*  whatever the Indian arena is called, which by the way, it's been around since 1999. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1317.9599999999998s)]
*  It might be my favorite arena. Same year as staple center. The place is awesome. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1318.68s)]
*  And the staple center should, should, uh, should be fumigated. Um, but I was thinking as I was [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1322.28s)]
*  walking there a year ago, I went to the two Dallas Celtic games in Dallas, which were super fun. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1329.0s)]
*  And it's like, it really felt like the Celtics were going to win the title. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1336.3600000000001s)]
*  And this was hopefully this finals can be over. And now the Celtics era is completely over. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1339.96s)]
*  Wasn't game three, the seminal, um, go winds at the refs and fouls out. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1346.36s)]
*  That was the Jalen Brown Duncan traffic game. That was the Jalen Brown, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1351.72s)]
*  one of the finals that VP that game. That was a crazy game to be a, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1355.6399999999999s)]
*  and that was the Luca just found out, oh my God, this is full circle. Kyrie Kyrie is going to beat [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1358.84s)]
*  the Celtics in this game. I can't believe this is lined up. And then he actually missed some chats. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1365.24s)]
*  We're going to take a break and a lot more to discuss about this game. This is the Celtics [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1369.3999999999999s)]
*  game. We're going to take a break and a lot more to discuss about this game. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1373.88s)]

*  Let's talk about Indiana, the basketball city, because we're both here, which is a really [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1408.1999999999998s)]
*  special place. And obviously I've talked about it a million times. It's the place of Hoosiers [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1413.08s)]
*  and Larry Bird and, um, you know, it's 49 States and then there's Indiana, whatever the saying is. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1416.9199999999998s)]
*  They show Oscar Robertson, courtside, you know, legend in high school in the 1950s. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1424.28s)]
*  It's weird. Oscar doesn't really have a team in the NBA because he played for the Cincinnati [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1432.04s)]
*  Royals that don't exist anymore. And then he was in the Bucks for a few years, but Indiana is kind [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1439.3999999999999s)]
*  of weirdly his team. Then they go back. They show Reggie Miller. They show Edgeron James. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1443.56s)]
*  That was a great one. I was like, this is great. Please show Larry Legend. Where is he? Um, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1449.56s)]
*  but the crowd was just, you know, everyone's wearing jerseys. Everyone is like super optimistic. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1456.2s)]
*  And a bunch of people are talking to me or yelling, yelling at me like, what do you think? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1462.0400000000002s)]
*  What do you think? We got a chance. Like just like the happiest basketball place, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1466.44s)]
*  so much fun to come here. And you made the key point. The arena is probably the best. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1470.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a great arena. I think it's number one for me. Every seat is good. Even the corners are good. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1473.96s)]
*  The crowd feels like they're on top of the game. When you have a game like today, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1479.16s)]
*  I do think it affects the game because I think if you're the visiting team, it's just, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1482.92s)]
*  it feels like the fans are on top of you in a slightly different way. And those fans are, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1488.04s)]
*  are fantastic. And boy game four, I mean, look, Oklahoma city said gut check moments and [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1491.48s)]
*  the Denver series down to one. That was a big test. Minnesota, I mean, up to one in Minnesota [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1500.1200000000001s)]
*  for game four, semi gut check, a little bit of a gut check. This is the ultimate, if you want to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1506.1200000000001s)]
*  become a championship team, this is about as big of a game and as big of a test as you're going to [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1511.56s)]
*  face down to one in the finals on the road against the team that has proven itself championship [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1516.6s)]
*  caliber. And that absolutely thinks we can do the whole thing. Like there's no doubt it. There's no, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1521.96s)]
*  if there were any doubt, and I don't really think there was, there is no doubt anymore that like [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1527.1599999999999s)]
*  we can do the whole thing. So the 2015 warriors, I think they went the whole thing. Well, I think [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1531.1599999999999s)]
*  they fell behind to one of Memphis and hit that similar point and they had to win game four in [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1536.9199999999998s)]
*  Memphis in the second round. It wasn't like, no, this is way bigger stakes, but it was the same [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1541.16s)]
*  kind of it with the younger teams. You have the chest hair game. I thought they already had the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1546.76s)]
*  chest hair game when, uh, the, the Denver series, you know, they had three of them. Well, yeah, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1551.0800000000002s)]
*  the four of them, if you include a game six, was it game four, all these games blend together. One [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1558.44s)]
*  of those game, game four, game five, four and game five. They both won a game for coming for in [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1563.0s)]
*  Denver, uh, game four in Denver in a game where in game five, they were behind and teetering. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1569.56s)]
*  And then Wiggins, that was the Wiggins making shots against the zone and Jaylen Williams hit [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1575.6399999999999s)]
*  the three and gave, yeah, it was that stretch. I thought that's when they got through it, but now [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1580.6s)]
*  you're right. This is, uh, because I watched this happen. The reason I mentioned that Dallas Miami [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1584.9199999999998s)]
*  series at the top, you can think you're the better team and okay. See, he has a better team. They [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1591.0s)]
*  have a better team, but you still have to beat the other team four times. Indiana doesn't think, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1595.4s)]
*  okay, see is better than them. They showed it today and at some point they're going to have to [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1601.72s)]
*  go and take it. And when you're at these games, when you're in the room and you feel it slipping [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1605.96s)]
*  away, I, there's nothing, there's no other sport like it. Like football, baseball, none of these [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1611.48s)]
*  hockey, none of these other sports have where you're watching it going, I can't believe this [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1616.6000000000001s)]
*  is how it's playing out. I remember in the Dallas Miami series and Jason Terry hit that crazy 30 [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1621.8s)]
*  foot three against, uh, Miami to quench. I think it was game five, hit the hand in the bronze hand [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1627.24s)]
*  in his face. Even when he was taking it, I was like, I can't believe Dallas is going to win game [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1633.96s)]
*  five. This is the most basic day I've ever seen. And then they want it. They went in six. So there's [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1638.68s)]
*  going to be a moment in game four when okay. See is, is going to have to decide, is this really how [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1644.2s)]
*  our season's going to end? This is what's going to happen. Um, first of all, just for the record, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1650.28s)]
*  the calves were up two on over the warriors in the 2015 final. So the warriors did have a game four [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1656.6s)]
*  on the road and that's when they went small and did you ever think that calves without Kyrie and [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1661.56s)]
*  starting Mazgov, I never, I never felt the word podcasting with Brian Winnhorst. Yeah. I never [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1668.28s)]
*  felt like the warriors were in like major danger. It was weird. Memphis. I felt like they were, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1674.04s)]
*  was more dangerous for them because Memphis was so weird. So here's the thing about like you, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1678.2s)]
*  you just said Oklahoma city is a better team. I think we all think Oklahoma city is a better [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1682.52s)]
*  team. Doesn't mean they're going to win the series. No, but, and I can hear Indiana fans saying, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1687.32s)]
*  oh, hold on now. Like you erase our first 30 games when Halliburton is just finding his rhythm after [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  a tough start and we get our defense together and them hard to knee Smith, get healthy and back in [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1699.24s)]
*  the lineup. We can go toe to toe with anybody. And they were much better. I'm just looking up [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1703.48s)]
*  the numbers now from February 1st till end of season. So half the season of basically [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1707.72s)]
*  Oklahoma city, 31 and five net rating, 13.7 Indiana 24 and 12 net rating 3.7. So getting, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1714.28s)]
*  getting there, but like still kind of a big gap from March 1st on it gets, it gets narrower [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1723.4s)]
*  Oklahoma city, 20 and three plus 12.9 Indiana 17 and seven plus 5.3. So yeah, the gap narrowed, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1729.6399999999999s)]
*  but like, this is still surprising that Indiana has gotten this good, this fast and kept trending up [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1737.96s)]
*  and kept narrowing that gap. And now they're just, they're just as good. I mean, we got it. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1745.1599999999999s)]
*  We didn't talk enough about math or your guy. So he's the one guy in the team who feels like he [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1749.6399999999999s)]
*  can create his own shot against really good defense, no matter who's guarding him, except [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1755.8s)]
*  for the door. Who's the good reaper. What was impressive to me was how calm he looked, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1759.48s)]
*  just how easy those mid range jumpers look for him. Like I'm just, I'm just walking right into [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1767.08s)]
*  it. I'm just strolling into it and maybe you got to pressure him more or whatever. There was a lot [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1771.48s)]
*  of commentary on Twitter about, you know, Oklahoma city's bigs are too far back on some of these. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1774.52s)]
*  I thought it was mostly good defense. Like you just gotta make guys make shots, but he scored on [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1779.0s)]
*  jumpers. He scored on pull up threes. He scored on catch and shoot threes. He had a bunch of cuts [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1783.88s)]
*  in the first half, often off of McConnell actions and stuff where it's like, he just had a very [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1788.68s)]
*  mature all around floor game that you don't necessarily associate with a guy that was kind [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1794.92s)]
*  of known as a chucker. And he did a little bit of everything. You got transition points, like a [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1800.68s)]
*  little bit of every part of his offensive game came out and they, and it was just, and you know, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1805.16s)]
*  14 in the second quarter. Yeah. And he's like, you know, there's this whole thing of Indiana [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1811.48s)]
*  never tanks and they build from the middle. And that's largely true. He is the, he is the product [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1815.5600000000002s)]
*  of like they're really only close to bottoming out season when they got the six pick and Jairus [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1822.76s)]
*  Walker is the other one and he's not playing, he's been injured and whatever, but like they're now [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1827.64s)]
*  getting something from him. They're getting a lot from him. They're just like, they just have a lot [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1832.28s)]
*  of good players. I actually think Walker would have played in this series. I do too. Yeah. I like [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1836.2s)]
*  Walker. 14 in the second quarter for him. It's a weird one because it feels like he's been on the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1840.28s)]
*  trade block for about a year in some ways. Like he does feel he has felt available and he's always [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1849.32s)]
*  the person that gets brought up first. You said that earlier when they talk about if they change [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1855.8799999999999s)]
*  the team, is he in it? If they try to upgrade, like if they try to get like cam Johnson or [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1860.92s)]
*  whoever, but I don't know. I like the vibe that he brings to them. This hit or miss, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1866.1200000000001s)]
*  he can carry you for a quarter. Like I really value guys like that. So there's this whole [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1871.8s)]
*  debate. Richard was like that for the Celtics where he could just carry them for eight minutes out of [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1876.2s)]
*  nowhere and he never knew what was going to happen. And when it happened, it was like a fucking, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1879.88s)]
*  you felt like you found money in your pocket. There's this whole debate with Matherin [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1883.24s)]
*  about, you know, he doesn't really play the Pacer style. Like the ball sticks with him a little bit [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1888.6s)]
*  more. He's not as intuitive, a quick twitch, quick pass, quick cut decision makers, everybody else on [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1894.52s)]
*  the team. And I think I said this to you last time we podcasted, like initially I think that was [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1899.48s)]
*  thought of as like, Hey, he's not that great of a fit. He doesn't play the way we feel. And the more [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1905.4s)]
*  I watch him, the more I'm like, every team kind of needs a curve ball. That's like even the warriors, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1908.76s)]
*  like Steve, it's like, it's a, it's a little bit of a weird example to bring up now, but he would [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1914.6s)]
*  always be like, the reason I like Wiggins on our team is he can break away from our beautiful game [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1919.48s)]
*  cuts and just like get us a few buckets one-on-one when nothing else is working. We need that kind of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1925.88s)]
*  guy on our team. I think he's like the curve ball that to be a championship team, you kind of need. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1930.6s)]
*  If you play, if Indiana, if you play a style that's like Indiana, I think you need a guy who could be [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1936.68s)]
*  like, eh, that sounds cool, but I'm just going to do some like traditional guy stuff. Right. Be the [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1942.6s)]
*  guy. I don't feel like he's as ball stoppy as he used to be. He's gotten much better and defensively [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1947.56s)]
*  he's gotten better too. One thing I noticed, I wanted to talk to you cause it's about as basketball [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1952.36s)]
*  nerdy as I'm going to get with you. You can go seven levels higher than me with some of the super [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1956.52s)]
*  nerd stuff and talk pin downs and double pin downs and reverse pin downs and upside down pin downs. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1961.08s)]
*  How many pin downs are there? A lot of pin downs. A lot of the Pacers are breaking out some creative stuff. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1967.1599999999999s)]
*  You can do a full pin down podcast. One thing I've noticed that these two teams specifically do, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1972.28s)]
*  and I don't know if it's a trend and I don't know if it's something teams will copy [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1978.92s)]
*  when they watch this and see what's successful. They do it with Shea with the, uh, with OKC and [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1983.32s)]
*  they do with Halburn, but then weirdly also with Matherin where it's like the guy has the ball, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1989.48s)]
*  set him a pickup top. He's moving around, he's moving back. He dumps it off. The ball immediately [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1994.92s)]
*  comes back to him and it's like this constant. He has, it's almost like watching a hockey power [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=1999.56s)]
*  play where they keep giving it back to the defenseman so he can reset whatever the attack on the net. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2005.56s)]
*  And the ball just kind of keeps moving around and sees little hockey passes versus like how the [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2011.8799999999999s)]
*  Celtics play where it's like we dribble up. I'm going to hunt this match up. Come set me a pick. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2017.24s)]
*  You three guys stand there. I'm just going to keep dribbling until I get the look I want. Then [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2024.36s)]
*  I'm going to shoot. Indy's doing a version of that and OKC is too where the ball is still moving [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2028.6s)]
*  around all the time, but they're doing the same thing. And I think it's way harder to stop. And [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2033.6399999999999s)]
*  I wonder if it's going to be something that's replicated next season. Is that, was that coherent? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2038.12s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Yeah, it's, I mean, it's 12, 12, 20 AM. You flew cross country. You're doing [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2043.24s)]
*  great. Um, I mean, Indiana definitely plays a more random, unpredictable style than Oklahoma City. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2049.72s)]
*  And I just think. But do you think that they, they deliberately don't want anybody to have the ball [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2056.92s)]
*  for more than like three, three and a half seconds? For sure. It seems like that's a real thing for them. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2062.6800000000003s)]
*  It's, it can't be a hard and fast rule because sometimes Siakam has a mismatch. You just got to [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2067.08s)]
*  give him the ball and let him. Yeah. So he'll back down. That's like the one time they'll mess [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2070.76s)]
*  around with it. And Matherin, you know, will do his stuff. But I mean, it's, you could only play that way [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2075.96s)]
*  if your best player, your offensive number one option is a guy who wants to get off the ball [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2082.44s)]
*  fast, who lives to get other people involved. And often, you know, and the Edwards is learning this [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2088.92s)]
*  in Minnesota. Like if you get off the ball, you will often get it back. It will go all the way around [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2095.2400000000002s)]
*  to you because you will have compromised the defense with that first pass and it will, they'll [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2099.88s)]
*  be in rotation and you'll be the guy who the ball should get back to in rotation. And Halliburton just [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2104.52s)]
*  plays that way. You can't play that way if your best player doesn't, doesn't have that kind of [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2108.84s)]
*  basketball ethos to him. And he does. Yeah. Cause in person you can watch, it's much easier to watch [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2113.32s)]
*  the people who don't have the ball. So I was watching some of the stuff Nie Smith was doing [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2119.1600000000003s)]
*  in the second half as they're doing all the stuff on the top and Halliburton is dipping off, he's [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2123.0800000000004s)]
*  getting back and they're moving around and they're trying to create mismatches and he's in the corner. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2127.1600000000003s)]
*  But then sometimes he would kind of creep in if the, if the defender was falling asleep on him [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2131.4s)]
*  and see if he could get a little back cut or he would, he would dart in or he would try to get [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2136.84s)]
*  an offensive rebound. Everybody in that team is up to something. It's not a team where the guys are [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2140.76s)]
*  just like, I'll just be here in the corner. I hope it works out for you. You know what I mean? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2145.56s)]
*  So they are very, I talked about this on my much, my nerdier podcast before, but on the pin down [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2149.88s)]
*  was Zach Lowe. That would make me a title, but, but we're going to get deep now, deep in Indiana [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2156.76s)]
*  paces lore right now. They are extremely proud of Nie Smith for exactly what you just described [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2162.6s)]
*  for learning how to move without the ball, to screen and to be random, to cut, to always be on [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2171.7999999999997s)]
*  his toes. Well, remember on the Celtics, he just stood there. Well, that was one of the reasons. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2177.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, he was, wasn't his fault. And he just told him, go in the corner. You're not going to [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2181.08s)]
*  have the ball. And you know what the deep cut is? The guy, they give a lot of credit, not only for [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2185.0s)]
*  that, but for his partnership with Halliburton and Halliburton really leaning into a crazy motion, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2190.28s)]
*  get off the ball offense is a guy who's no longer on the Pacers. It's Buddy healed. The coaches of [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2197.32s)]
*  the Pacers talk about Buddy healed lasting impact on Nie Smith on Halliburton and just how they play. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2203.0s)]
*  Like it, it comes up and they, and first of all, everybody loves Buddy healed. He's the most [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2210.84s)]
*  various personality. He's an extremely hard worker. He's a beloved teammate. Everybody loves [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2217.08s)]
*  Buddy healed, but they talk about his impact in particular on exactly what you just described [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2220.76s)]
*  with Nie Smith more than anyone else on the team. I wonder if it's replicable or I wonder if they [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2225.72s)]
*  just have been doing it for so long. Cause okay. See, we'll have, they have their version of it, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2233.16s)]
*  but then they also do what you talked about earlier, where it's just a lot of dribbling and [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2237.64s)]
*  the ball stops moving around in the same way. And look, they made tough shots. Like if you tell you, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2243.4s)]
*  if you said before the game, Chet, J Dub and Shay are going to combine for 70 points on like not [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2247.2400000000002s)]
*  great shooting, but let me see if we can do the math. 24 of 53 with a lot of free throws between [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2253.7200000000003s)]
*  them too. Like it's not like they off their offensive rating for the game is, is bad, but it, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2260.76s)]
*  it didn't feel like, I mean, they got nothing from the bench. Hardenstein's first bad game of the [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2267.6400000000003s)]
*  series. Wiggins disappeared. Got the hard thing is an issue. That's it. That would be one of the [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2272.04s)]
*  topics tomorrow about maybe this is why they were so afraid to play the double bigs. Maybe this is, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2278.44s)]
*  maybe they anticipated this. Maybe there was stuff during the season that they saw with this matchup [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2284.04s)]
*  with him. Cause I thought that he looked a little gamey. I'm also like, if I'm Indiana, I'm delighted [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2288.04s)]
*  when, and I think Isaiah Joe's a good player, but every time somebody like Isaiah Joe or even [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2294.36s)]
*  Wiggins is in the game, I'm so happy that the fucking gauntlet of all those defenders are out [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2299.8s)]
*  there at the same time. Um, and conversely, I mean, watching what Nemard was trying to do to SGA. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2304.6000000000004s)]
*  And I thought that he got called for a couple chintzy fouls, um, watching how different SGA was [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2312.1200000000003s)]
*  the moment num hard would come out of the game versus when them hard in, I thought it was pretty [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2318.52s)]
*  interesting. It was like the straight jacket came off basically. Nemheart is just awesome. Like pick [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2322.52s)]
*  31. I pick 31. We're just never going to be good at the draft. That's, that's what we learn over [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2328.68s)]
*  and over again. Pick 31, 30 guys over him. Pick 31 and they got him and the pick that became Ben [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2333.48s)]
*  Shepard in the same little just random trade. I think it was one of the Kara Sliver trades [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2338.9199999999996s)]
*  and Nemheart eight points, nothing stuff jumps off the stat sheet. He's just an awesome basketball [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2343.72s)]
*  player. Like I remember when he signed that contract, which was like 18, $19 million a year. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2349.72s)]
*  Do you go back and read some of the reviews that I don't know, that's like too little, too much for [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2353.7999999999997s)]
*  a team that's going to be up against the tax. I remember just thinking like the guy's good, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2357.56s)]
*  like a good player making $20 million. That's just what that's just fine. Like he's just a really good [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2361.88s)]
*  player. Are you ever unhappy when Andrew Nemheart is on the floor? No matter what he's doing, it's [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2367.48s)]
*  like, I'm always happy to have that guy around. Even if he's floating around on offense or not [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2372.2s)]
*  guarding the best guy or he's switched on to that guy, it's like he's going to do the right thing [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2375.56s)]
*  every single time. Even if the right thing is not something that you really notice. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2379.56s)]
*  He's also a Dick. And I mean this as a compliment. He's got a Dick side that's like very, very [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2384.2s)]
*  underground, but it'll come out once or twice a game. There's a moment in the game where SGA got [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2390.68s)]
*  fouled and then he tried, was going for a continuation. Nemheart came in and basically did the second [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2395.9599999999996s)]
*  foul on him and SGA didn't like it. He went to the ref to complain about the foul and Nemheart just [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2400.7599999999998s)]
*  walked over right next to him and was just like being a Dick and was like, really? You're going to [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2405.9599999999996s)]
*  bitch about that? And was just kind of just trying to get under his skin a little bit, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2411.16s)]
*  which he's been doing in every series and he loves it. And it's like a Canadian thing. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2415.24s)]
*  He's doing like the Canadian playoff hockey thing. He's like the guys that basically he would be on [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2420.44s)]
*  Florida, just like hit somebody with this stick right after the whistle. I love that shit. I did [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2425.24s)]
*  listen to you and Ryan talk about the Stanley Cup finals a little bit. It made me want to get into [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2429.0s)]
*  the Stanley Cup finals. You would love it. Florida apparently has got a lot of a lot of [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2432.44s)]
*  hateable guys. Oh, Nemheart wouldn't even crack the top five for what's the score? Who's winning [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2436.6s)]
*  that? Florida's up. Do they alternate so at least we can go NBA finals? Yeah, they do. They try to [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2441.4s)]
*  steer clear from NBA. Yeah. No, that game three was the classic where Florida took a big lead and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2447.24s)]
*  then we just had to have fights. Each team has to lay down their masculinity on the other team. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2452.92s)]
*  I will never get over that fighting is just allowed in hockey. It's crazy. The one that's really crazy [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2459.4s)]
*  there's professional lacrosse stuff where they can fight. In hockey you have skates. You only [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2466.28s)]
*  can get so much leverage. You're lacrosse. You can really plant and sock somebody. I'm kind of [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2471.32s)]
*  surprised that lacrosse fights. All right. More stuff from this game. Yeah, go. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2477.96s)]
*  Okay. See starting five with Wallace. Do we see anything different in game four, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2483.32s)]
*  which I think we both agree is a backs to the wall game for okay. See, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2494.92s)]
*  because if you go down three, one with game six looming, I don't care how good you are. That's, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2499.1600000000003s)]
*  that's a place that only a few teams in the history of the league has come back from. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2504.36s)]
*  I think the only move I'm going to guess. No, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2508.2s)]
*  I think the only reasonable move, unless it's something out of left field, like we're going [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2516.12s)]
*  to just start Kendrick Williams and see what happens in the case of Wallace. But I think [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2519.8799999999997s)]
*  the only move is to start Caruso over Wallace. That's what I had as well. And I don't really [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2523.7999999999997s)]
*  know that anything that happened today screams for that being necessary. But [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2529.16s)]
*  I don't love the plus minus that, but did you see the plus minus that? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2534.92s)]
*  Well, Caruso is minus 15 today and Wallace was minus 10. So take, take whichever you like. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2538.68s)]
*  But I mean, Caruso played 32 minutes and I don't know how much more than that he's going to play, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2544.8399999999997s)]
*  even if you start him or not, but he is better than case in Wallace. And I do wonder like we [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2550.44s)]
*  see these coaches further you get in the playoffs, that rotation starts to tighten, right? And okay. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2557.16s)]
*  I see as an unusual team because like even today they played 11 minutes, like legitimately, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2563.0s)]
*  I mean, 11 guys played. Kendrick Williams only played two minutes, but they still, they played. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2567.96s)]
*  He played 11 minutes. Do you remember the shot that you took? It wasn't great. Just got the ball, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2572.76s)]
*  three point arc, jab step, like 28 feet from the room. Like I guess I'm just going to shoot now. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2577.4s)]
*  It's like one of those possessions where it's like, Hey, I'm in the finals. I get, I'm going [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2582.04s)]
*  to take a three. I just feel like you're probably good with nine guys, maybe 10 max. But if you're [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2585.4s)]
*  down, usually what we see teams short in the rotation, go to eight, maybe seven playing big [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2592.2s)]
*  minutes. I had the same thought. I wonder if Caruso just starts and maybe they do it that way. The [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2598.68s)]
*  only other one I was thinking was would they start Isaiah Joe for some, just a weird three point look [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2604.2s)]
*  out of nowhere for seven minutes. That's another out of the left field one. I don't see it. The [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2612.12s)]
*  other thing that's interesting is in the last two games, we've seen zero of the no big man lineup. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2616.92s)]
*  And I thought that lineup did not, I think the plus minus was not good in game one, but I still [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2624.6s)]
*  thought it was something I would try if I were the thunder. And I'm, I'm a little surprised that [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2630.12s)]
*  they've gone like completely away from it. I would like to see that as like a four minute, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2633.88s)]
*  just blitz them with switching and swiping and steals and see, see if that can just like muck [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2639.48s)]
*  up the game a little bit with even more speed than we normally have. Well, neither of us work [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2644.12s)]
*  for ASP anymore, but I think we have, we have to do a segment called step up. Okay. Who's got to [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2648.7599999999998s)]
*  step up? I'm looking at the box score right now and KSan Wallace. I don't know if you need to step up. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2659.16s)]
*  Step up. Isaiah Hardenstein, you need to step up. Miles Turner maybe needs to step up. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2667.56s)]
*  Isaiah Hardenstein, the $30 million man. You were the big French edition. Yeah. Four and three. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2674.04s)]
*  No, that's the thing is like, I think that was just a really nice competitive fucking basketball [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2682.84s)]
*  game. SGA slight step up. Well, that's, let's talk about that. 10% step up. 24 points, six turnovers, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2688.92s)]
*  four assists, 20 shots, 24 points, 42 minutes. It took us too long to get here. Yeah. He did not [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2695.88s)]
*  play a good enough game. He didn't. He didn't. He, uh, took us too long to get to SGA. We're so in [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2702.04s)]
*  love with the McConnell's and the Matherians and the Toppins took us too long to get to SGA because [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2711.8s)]
*  he didn't play. He was like good or like, like the B minus SGA game. Probably I would go C plus. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2715.8s)]
*  C plus. So here's what here's, here was the vibe I got from him in this game. It reminded me of [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2721.8s)]
*  FIBA. As you know, I'm one of the only people that loves all the FIBA games in the Olympics [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2727.1600000000003s)]
*  when the rules are different and we send the guys over there and they think they're going to get a [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2731.4s)]
*  call and they don't get it. And then they do another and they don't get the call. And they're just [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2735.7200000000003s)]
*  kind of, are you going free throw merchant? Not going merchant. Um, it just felt like [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2739.96s)]
*  he was getting defended in a way that, uh, he didn't really adjust to as well that well. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2746.28s)]
*  Uh, he, he was trying to bounce off guys. There was one time where, you know, he did get the hook [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2753.7200000000003s)]
*  arm. He did that a couple of times, but for the most part, I thought the refs called him really [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2758.44s)]
*  fairly. I thought they called both sides. Like the Indiana crowd was probably matter. Then maybe they [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2762.84s)]
*  should have been, but you know, they're a home crowd they're doing, but I thought for the most [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2767.8s)]
*  part, they allowed a lot of physicality on both sides and I don't know if that's great for him. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2771.8s)]
*  And I also thought again, like with the exception of their, their big man point of attack defense [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2776.04s)]
*  on some pick and rolls, like miles Turner, Thomas Bryant, but their defense was pretty good. And I [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2781.8s)]
*  thought they're off ball defense. I again, I'll go back and watch it tomorrow, but just like they're [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2787.48s)]
*  stunting back and forth on his pick and rolls, they're trying to make him a decision maker and [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2793.4s)]
*  cloud his decision making. And I thought they did a good job of that tonight. Like a lot of the, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2799.4s)]
*  a few of his turnovers were bad pass turnovers on the pick and roll where he was kind of caught in [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2803.4s)]
*  between reads a little bit and didn't quite know what to do with it. Um, I thought they're deep and [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2807.1600000000003s)]
*  they started doubling him. He loves to do the thing where he drives to like the deadest dead [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2812.28s)]
*  spot on the floor of the spot that nobody ever wants to ball in, which is like 18 feet from the [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2817.4s)]
*  rim on the baseline because he's, he just thinks no one is going to come help here. It's just going [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2822.52s)]
*  to be me because who's going to double here. And the Pacers as the wolves did a little bit in the [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2827.96s)]
*  last series started springing doubles on him. There's a topic kept coming over. I thought that [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2833.8s)]
*  was where we're just not going to give you this shot. We're going to force you to pass it. And [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2837.96s)]
*  one, and once they gave up a bat, they, their rotations are bad. Isaiah Joe hit a wide open [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2841.56s)]
*  three, like the one guy you absolutely cannot leave open on Oklahoma city. But other than that, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2845.8s)]
*  their rotations were pretty good. And, you know, I just think, you know, again, Rick Carlisle is very [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2850.12s)]
*  good at not overdoing anything. Like just because they did that a few times today and it worked, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2855.0s)]
*  they may not do it the first couple of times. Shea goes to that spot in game four. They did [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2859.64s)]
*  a nice job. It didn't feel like he was going downhill as much as he normally does in playoff [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2863.8s)]
*  games when he's just scoring 36 to 38 points. My guess would be he's going to be awesome in game four. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2868.92s)]
*  I mean, game two was just a spectacular performance. Yeah, that was an A plus. Today was a C plus. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2874.44s)]
*  Yeah. And when you, maybe they stumbled on something. I was an easy teacher, so I'd give [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2881.88s)]
*  them a B minus, but when the MVP has a B minus C plus, like they're, you're vulnerable. My grades [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2885.4s)]
*  for today, the Indiana crowd was an A plus, the A plus superb job by them. I have no notes. Just [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2890.6s)]
*  keep doing what you're doing in Indiana. And I loved having Oscar Robertson and Reggie Miller [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2897.08s)]
*  there and Larry Legend should be here for game four. If they really want to bring the roof down, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2903.16s)]
*  fucking private Jackson was here. Mark Jackson was there. Mark Jackson was up in a suite. Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2907.24s)]
*  I thought Hal Burton was probably an A. Yeah, I think he was the A plus would have been the game [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2913.64s)]
*  for Nick series. I really liked some of the stuff he was doing on defense. I thought he was active [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2920.8399999999997s)]
*  and problematic for OKC, but I thought he was fantastic. Toppin gets an A minus for me. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2926.2s)]
*  Matthew and gets an A, TJ McConnell, probably, probably a B plus. I didn't like a couple of the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2933.0s)]
*  turnovers. Okay. And then for OKC, I really liked what Jaylen Williams did in that game. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2939.2400000000002s)]
*  I thought, I thought they relied on him in kind of a shocking way offensively where they, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2946.84s)]
*  it almost felt like they were one A one B, a little Jaylen Brown, Jason Tatum ish. It does feel [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2952.04s)]
*  like the more stress they get put under and the fewer easy transition baskets they get when that's [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2957.56s)]
*  when they get rolling, right? Like, and that's when their passing gets, gets unleashed and they get [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2963.48s)]
*  alley oops and all that. It does feel like for not all the time, not even for the majority of time, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2967.6400000000003s)]
*  but for segments of each of these games, high pressure games, that there's not as much synergy [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2972.92s)]
*  between Shea and J Dubb as you would like there to be for dueling banjo, best a little bit of like, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2977.96s)]
*  like there's been a lot of Jaylen Williams going on right now. And Shea's kind of standing in the [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2985.4s)]
*  corner and like, okay, now there's a lot of Shea going on. And you would just like a little bit [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2989.32s)]
*  more possessions when there's like a lot of both going on. That's all we're going to take a break. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2993.0s)]
*  And then I have a really important subject to bring up about this series. That's, that's, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=2997.32s)]
*  I could see getting cut out of a social media video. Oh boy. Yeah. All right. Coming back, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3002.2000000000003s)]
*  social media segment time. Okay. You want to say it? I'll let you do it. Kyle, turn the TikTok [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3006.6s)]
*  camera on. If OKC loses this series. Oh boy. Here we go. You can't resist going to the end. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3012.6s)]
*  We're in the middle. Let's enjoy the middle. I wasn't allowing myself or even considering it [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3022.52s)]
*  was a possibility until I was in that arena tonight when realizing that OKC has to figure out how to [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3028.8399999999997s)]
*  win in that arena either Friday night or next week, or they're not going to win the title. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3034.68s)]
*  It's good math. Your math is right. If they don't win the title, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3040.2s)]
*  this would be an absolute historic basketball calamity because they had one of the greatest [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3046.3599999999997s)]
*  seasons of all time and, uh, start to finish. I'm not saying they're one of the greatest teams of [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3052.2s)]
*  all time, but they had one of the seven, eight, nine, 10, whatever list you want to do from net [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3057.96s)]
*  ratings to actual record to dominance to 15, 20 point wins. It was one of the best seasons anyone's [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3063.72s)]
*  ever had. And to then go to the finals and lose year in rare ground. You're in 2016 warriors, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3071.08s)]
*  Draymond punching LeBron in the balls and Steph playing on an injured ankle and Festa Zazili [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3078.68s)]
*  being trapped on an island against LeBron for two straight threes. And all of a sudden we've lost. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3084.2s)]
*  What the hell happened? Uh, this does not happen a lot in basketball. Usually the right team, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3089.48s)]
*  usually the better team, usually the team that has the best season [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3096.52s)]
*  wins the title. But then occasionally that's not what happens. And this is one of those times. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3100.52s)]
*  It would be interesting to look back at most dominant teams that didn't win. Um, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3105.72s)]
*  it's the shortest list. Very short list. I remember doing this last year when Boston [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3113.2400000000002s)]
*  was on the verge of winning the title because of their number. What did they win 66 games last [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3119.48s)]
*  year or something? When you get, when you get into the 80 win territory as a team, when you're 80, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3123.88s)]
*  18, 82 and 20, like, but I remember going through basketball reference and doing the [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3128.92s)]
*  wins, regular season wins, regular season net rating, playoff net rating, and how many teams [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3136.28s)]
*  checked every box at a certain level of eliteness or whatever. Like just narrowing it down or [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3142.84s)]
*  finagling the numbers in different ways. And let's just say when the thunder were up two, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3148.28s)]
*  oh, against Minnesota, I reread that the piece that I ended up writing about Boston and where [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3152.28s)]
*  that Boston team place in history should be and would be compared to those other teams. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3158.52s)]
*  A pure math case. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3163.0800000000004s)]
*  It just, well, no, it just like, but it wasn't a pure math case. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3164.2000000000003s)]
*  Just like record stats. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3167.0s)]
*  My ultimate conclusion, which I think was right, then a lot of people made it was the math says [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3169.88s)]
*  that Celtics team is like way up here. I think they're probably a little bit like really great [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3174.6s)]
*  team, but with some of the other just like really great teams, not as up here as the mass of anyway, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3180.12s)]
*  I just cut and pasted that and put it in an email to myself to have it fresh in preparation for what [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3184.44s)]
*  looked like, I mean, when they were up two, oh, against Minnesota, it was like, are they just going [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3190.12s)]
*  to win? Are they not losing for the rest of the season? Like that's, I led my podcast that night [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3195.24s)]
*  that way. Like, did they just, did they arrive? Yeah. Well, I mean, I just, are they just going [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3200.04s)]
*  to go six and oh, and the playoffs are going to be over before we know it. And now, and again, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3203.88s)]
*  like the net rating can be what it is. Like, and again, the Pacers became a very good team. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3208.28s)]
*  The signs were all there, but there was still a difference between what Oklahoma city was [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3213.2400000000002s)]
*  resume wise and what the Pacers were last 40 games, even resume wise. Calamity. I mean, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3219.56s)]
*  I just think you have to give the credit to the Pacers. Something magical has happened here [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3226.36s)]
*  and there's still a long way from finishing it off. Like this is going to be very hard to do [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3230.8399999999997s)]
*  against a great team. That's still probably favored. I'd like to look at that. That's a good [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3235.3199999999997s)]
*  segment. Magical or calamity? Magical, calamity. Calamical. I think you're right in that the story [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3238.8399999999997s)]
*  leans more toward this is one of the most incredible stories in the history of the NBA. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3250.44s)]
*  Something happened. Something happened here. But I also think another piece [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3255.72s)]
*  to be holy shit. Okay. See, check every box we ever thought we'd have to check for a team [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3259.88s)]
*  that was going to win the title and they didn't win the title for one box that you've already [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3266.04s)]
*  brought up age. Yeah. Veteran, whatever. Um, well, that's the scary, that's the scariest [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3269.96s)]
*  thing with them is that they, you know, if they ended up winning the title, I don't feel like [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3276.04s)]
*  they're close to being the team. They're probably going to be two years from now. If everyone's [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3282.76s)]
*  healthy, they're just going to be better. They're going to be better. And like the poster guy for [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3286.44s)]
*  that to me is Chet. Um, I was talking to Drew Hanlon before the game, he works with Chet [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3291.64s)]
*  among many other people and I was just saying to him, like, I watched Chet in these games [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3296.6s)]
*  and he's missed so much time in his brief NBA career and he'll do three or four things every [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3300.76s)]
*  game where I'm like, is he just kind of scratching the surface of what he's going to do offensively? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3306.36s)]
*  Like, is he even doing 50% of what he's going to be able to do offensively? Drew's response was [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3311.72s)]
*  enthusiastic. Yes. Like there's a lot more there and I won't go into the conversation anymore, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3318.12s)]
*  but he's the guy. So you're saying Drew Hanlon talked about one of the players he was training? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3323.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, we just, I talked about it and he like, not kidding. Um, but, uh, but like I, yeah, I mean, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3327.56s)]
*  well, I think he's right because it's funny, Van, Van texted me a couple of days ago. I was like, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3335.0s)]
*  how good is Chet? I'm like, what do you mean? It's like, is it like, is there more here or is this it? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3340.76s)]
*  And I was like, I actually think there's way, way, way more here because even in college, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3346.36s)]
*  the way they used him at Gonzaga, he'd be at the top of the key and he would, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3352.6800000000003s)]
*  almost like a little like how Duke used Cooper flag last year where he was a little point [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3357.88s)]
*  forward sometimes. But I think there's this whole other level where you could run offense through [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3362.92s)]
*  him at the top of the key and he could either fake threes or go, you know, kick out. I, there's [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3367.96s)]
*  a post step game that'll probably have what four years from now. I mean, in the first quarter [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3373.88s)]
*  of that game, he had a coast to coast take around miles Turner. And then he had a little short roll [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3378.36s)]
*  where miles Turner was there like on the catch. And he just took like one dribble pivot step back [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3383.7200000000003s)]
*  like 12 footer or 15 footers. Like, God damn, that's a tough shot. This seems pretty amazing. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3389.4s)]
*  I, uh, they're down to one of the finals to the Indiana Pacers. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3395.96s)]
*  I'm going to go on Fandel right now. What do you think the line is? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3400.12s)]
*  Oklahoma city minus one 10. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3404.76s)]
*  But I've no, to be clear to the listeners, I have no idea how any of this works. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3409.08s)]
*  Okay. See minus two 35. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3412.28s)]
*  That's wow. Wow. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3414.36s)]
*  That's a thing. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3416.52s)]
*  Wasn't it minus three 50 or something coming into this game? So this win, I guess it's a home win. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3417.48s)]
*  No, it jumped up to the five hundreds again after they won game two. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3422.52s)]
*  Everyone and their brother had okay. Seeing five as their finals pick. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3427.4s)]
*  Did you have it? I had it. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3431.56s)]
*  We're wrong. We're officially wrong. Three games into the series. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3434.36s)]
*  Everyone was wrong. And I didn't want to do it because everyone had it. I wanted to zag [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3436.28s)]
*  and I just couldn't figure out how Indiana was going to win two games. And now we know that [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3442.44s)]
*  game one game that comeback and Halbert and the shot he hits. And that's how you, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3446.44s)]
*  could that be how the entire series swings? I don't know. All right. Predictions for game four. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3451.96s)]
*  And then I have some trade stuff to ask you about. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3456.52s)]
*  Oh, good. I like a 12 45. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3459.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you had one thing on your pod. I really want to dive into. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3461.32s)]
*  Okay. Predictions for game four. I'm just going to say Oklahoma city wins a very close game, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3465.08s)]
*  but Oklahoma city one 18, Indiana one 14. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3470.12s)]
*  Well, can we talk with maybe neither team? Cause they're both pretty young. Who has an advantage [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3474.04s)]
*  from that game today that we just went to was like a playoff game and a half. Yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3479.24s)]
*  Um, incredibly physical up and down, uh, intense, emotional, and now they got to play on Friday. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3486.6s)]
*  And I can't decide who that's more of a detriment to. My guess is the home crowd [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3494.68s)]
*  probably helps Indiana more. Okay. See I'm, I have my eye on Chet. Cause I really thought [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3499.72s)]
*  he looked wiped out in the fourth quarter. He was the one out of all the okay. See guys that I [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3505.08s)]
*  thought looked like he, he, he was spent, um, SGA maybe, I don't know, but maybe that's, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3509.56s)]
*  but on the other side, Hal Burton, I don't know. My guess is it's going to be kind of an ugly, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3516.92s)]
*  dramatic game and it would be decided by somebody weird. I like it. I would, I would go in Oklahoma [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3521.96s)]
*  city by four. I would pick okay. See as well. Okay. See is favored by six. I would not do that. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3529.48s)]
*  That's a lot. It's a lot of points. That's like, but I bet for, for thunder, even thunder playoff [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3534.6s)]
*  games, that's not very many points. I love this series and I don't care what the ratings are. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3539.2400000000002s)]
*  And if casual fans don't care because famous people that they knew or famous franchises aren't [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3544.68s)]
*  in it. You know what? Why do we need them? The NBA just signed an 11 year media deal. I'm fine. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3550.6s)]
*  I love basketball. That game was awesome. I like that. We have two new teams that are now in the [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3557.4s)]
*  fray and I think this finals is a win. And guess what? Indiana is a really small city and so is [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3562.84s)]
*  Oklahoma city. Shit happens. Well, the MVP is in this, in the series, right? That should be a very [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3568.92s)]
*  famous player. You've taught you and Ryan talked about how he's maybe not one of the 10 most famous [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3574.52s)]
*  person. It's a little Mike Trout ish. Okay. But he is the MVP and no matter who the teams are, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3578.36s)]
*  if it's a long series, the ratings will go up as the series goes on. So I, yeah, but I'll, I'll [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3586.68s)]
*  speak. Well, what was the last great finals? Great. The last great finals, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3593.0s)]
*  2013, no 2016 has to be the baseline. Everything after that is 16 and 30 years, raptors bubble. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3605.3999999999996s)]
*  Bucks, Bucks sons was a great finals. It was just weird because the crowd, the, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3616.2s)]
*  weren't we still in like half filled? That was a great, that's an underrated finals. That was a [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3619.9599999999996s)]
*  really good finals. Yeah, that's a good call. All right. So bucks on 16 warriors calves, 13 spurs. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3625.3999999999996s)]
*  Heat, I think is the best finals. Those two back to back. They're almost like Rocky one and Rocky [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3632.6s)]
*  two. Like they should all be one movie, but they've Miami broken the second finals. Yeah, but that's, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3638.52s)]
*  part of why it's like all one movie. And then 11, 11 finals, Mavs versus heat. Great one. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3643.0s)]
*  Tremendous 2010 Laker Celtics, dramatic, but the basketball, I don't think was that great. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3648.7599999999998s)]
*  Ugly. I'm trying to think what else. Yeah, I think those are probably the best ones of the century. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3655.0s)]
*  Oh five piston spurs. The game seven was kind of a dud for a game seven. Ugly and ratings were [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3663.72s)]
*  nobody. What nobody wanted. You know, it was a good one was the 2000 Pacers Lakers series. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3669.48s)]
*  That's a really fun series. If you go back and look at those games, all the more competitive. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3674.52s)]
*  That's a great Kobe game. Game four when Shaq fouls out. All right, quickly. So you had, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3678.2s)]
*  you were talking about Durant and you said, watch out for the Quippers, which I had kind of heard [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3683.4s)]
*  rumblings of myself. And I think Durant's going to the spurs. I'm just going to slap it down a [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3688.2s)]
*  second time. I think that's how it plays out. For sure. The two teams that there's the most buzz [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3693.72s)]
*  about are the spurs and the wolves. Right. So the wolves gets more complicated because [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3698.44s)]
*  the wolves one just breaks my brain. I don't know how it's going to be. Julius Randall and [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3704.76s)]
*  Naz read have to be involved somehow. You can do a go bear one. You can do go bear plus Steven [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3707.96s)]
*  Chenzo one. Why did the sons want go bear? I mean, Booker go bear is something. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3713.08s)]
*  Something. If you want to stay competitive because you don't have any control your draft picks, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3721.56s)]
*  because you've ish be a doll of them away. Would you take the cell 14, Harrison Barnes expiring [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3725.56s)]
*  and a good first? Yes, I would. I don't even think this, I don't know how the biggest mystery [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3733.24s)]
*  in the league right now is how aggressive the spurs are actually going to get. And I think that's code [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3740.36s)]
*  for, they're going to start with no number two, no castle, no Vasell and negotiate from there. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3744.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that's what I would guess that they're going to do. Like two and Castle are just out. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3752.12s)]
*  They should be. Katie's 37 and he makes 50 a year and he's got one year left on his deal. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3757.16s)]
*  And he's been in the league for 18 years. There's the subplot I forgot to get into on my podcast. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3761.88s)]
*  The two year, $112 million extension. The Jimi Butler. Do you do the one extra or the two extra? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3766.68s)]
*  Do the sons, a, is there a team that will trade for him not caring whether he signs it or not, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3773.96s)]
*  not even wanting him to sign it maybe. B, will the sons just, the sons, I assume, and I'm thinking [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3783.8s)]
*  we'll just trade them wherever. Like if this seems not on your list too bad, we're trading you to [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3793.72s)]
*  whoever gives us the best package. There's no list anymore. I don't, I think after how they handled [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3797.16s)]
*  February, it seems like they're working with a rich climate Katie's guy. It seems like they're [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3802.36s)]
*  being a cooperative because the way they handled it in February was not the way things usually go [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3807.0800000000004s)]
*  in the NBA. What if the Toronto Raptors are just like, you know what, we're going to try for a [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3812.92s)]
*  Kawhi 2.0 moonshot. Here's the best package you're going to get. Katie doesn't want to go there. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3817.48s)]
*  We don't even care if you sign the extension. You know who I don't want to deal with is a [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3823.0800000000004s)]
*  semi or unhappy Kevin Durant. I'm just not messing with that. So, but like what? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3826.7599999999998s)]
*  He should go to the Spurs. That's how it's going to play out. Is he going to be happy with the [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3834.44s)]
*  Spurs just because he wants to go there? Yes. Here's the case for the Spurs. He went to the [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3837.72s)]
*  University of Texas. He loves Texas. He talks about it all the time. He's always respected the Spurs. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3841.24s)]
*  He'll be like the respected veteran on the team. People in Texas like him. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3847.96s)]
*  Like the only two places he's ever really fit in, in a way where he loved the city was Texas and Seattle. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3852.6s)]
*  He picked the Nets. He picked the Nets, but he picked the team that was like the black sheep of [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3860.52s)]
*  the New York basketball scene. And he picked the Suns. Yeah. And he was 0 for 2 in happiness levels. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3866.76s)]
*  And he was unhappy in Golden State at the end too. He was unhappy the last year and a half for Golden State. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3873.48s)]
*  Yeah. So I think he would be happy on the Spurs. I hope so. I mean, I, Kevin Durand is an awesome, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3877.96s)]
*  awesome basketball player. I love everything. If you're the Spurs and you can keep enough stuff [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3885.16s)]
*  left to also make a Yanis run, you're doing it. And by the way, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3889.32s)]
*  Yeah. Whoa. Whoa. What can they, is that even like, sure. They've given a witness. They gave some of [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3894.84s)]
*  their picks away, including the Minnesota pick in the Fox deal. People forget like deer and Fox is [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3901.48s)]
*  like a, it's like they've, he's like a, we barely got to see it. Right. I didn't forget because it's [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3907.24s)]
*  weird because they ended up with number two pick and guess what? I'm not sure they would have done [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3912.2799999999997s)]
*  the deer and Fox trade if they knew that had happened. Well, I think they, cause Dylan, Dylan Harper [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3915.72s)]
*  and deer and Fox, even though they're completely different players, neither of them are great [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3921.56s)]
*  shooters. I don't know. It's a, it's a little, they have to take Harper it sounds like, but it's a [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3926.4399999999996s)]
*  little bit of a weird mix and then he's throwing castle too. I don't, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3932.44s)]
*  it would be so fascinating to be in their meetings right now because [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3936.68s)]
*  you know, Fox is late twenties, right? Wemba, Yamma is super young. The rest of the team is [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3941.0s)]
*  super young. Durant's 37. The, how much of our, how much of our Wemby timeline are we actually [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3946.36s)]
*  willing to sacrifice for a guy who's closer to 40 than he is to 30? And how good in the [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3954.2000000000003s)]
*  West are we actually, that's what you have to look in the mirror and say if we have like Fox, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3962.28s)]
*  Durant, Wemba, Yamma, let's say they even keep the castle, who's left on our bench. Like Sohan is [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3966.52s)]
*  maybe going out in that trade. Barnes is going on that trade is Kelton Johnson going out in that [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3973.5600000000004s)]
*  trade. Do we, are we actually a championship contender is Wemba, Yamma already that good? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3977.0s)]
*  Do we know enough about the Fox Wemba, Yamma fit that in our number two pick play real minutes for [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3981.88s)]
*  us and help us right away in the West. Are we, are we actually, can we win the free playoff series [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3987.24s)]
*  in the West? Well, that's why if you do the Durant thing, you're signing them for what, you know, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3993.0s)]
*  it's for at least two years would be my guess. I mean, I don't understand them. Do you want the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=3998.3599999999997s)]
*  rant on a two year, $112 million extension takes care of his body. But would you go to him and be [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4005.3199999999997s)]
*  like, Hey, no, I would want him, I would want him to take less because there was two options, right? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4011.4799999999996s)]
*  He could take 124 as well as the 124 made me blink. That's he's got to, he's got to wait, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4015.96s)]
*  I think a certain amount of time. He's got to wait six months and he could get that one. You know, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4022.36s)]
*  I remember hearing stuff like, you know, as he, as he and his people and the sons sort of negotiate [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4027.32s)]
*  his post Phoenix landing spot, which might be the, this might be the last thing. Like this might be [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4035.32s)]
*  the last chapter of Kevin Durant's basketball career. Comes home to Texas. He should really want to get it right. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4039.6400000000003s)]
*  Would he ever be like, you know, in this second apron era, that team X you're, you know, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4046.04s)]
*  you're going to be coming up against it. Like I'll do two years 60. I'll do like, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4052.04s)]
*  or maybe he just wants the one year because he wants to play in this goofy rival league that I [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4057.2400000000002s)]
*  talked about with Chuck close from the other day, this, this F1 international basketball league that [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4061.7200000000003s)]
*  is I think a little closer to actually being real than a lot of people. That's a big one. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4067.56s)]
*  Give a credit for it's a big curve ball. I don't think it's not a real thing. I did the, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4072.36s)]
*  I like doing the double knots now. It's harder to aggregate me. I mean, let's just imagine, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4078.04s)]
*  no, I'm not even going to do it. I'm not going to imagine I'm going to, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4083.32s)]
*  I'm just going to block that all the way back before I say, I'm just saying Durant taking less [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4085.8s)]
*  is a conversation I would want to have with him. Like, are you actually willing to do this to help [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4090.28s)]
*  us build out this team? Not saying you should. I brought this up because I'm saying that I think [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4094.1200000000003s)]
*  it's an idea that he's probably thought about himself. Well, yeah. And also these guys have [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4099.48s)]
*  made staggering amounts of money on the court and off the court. And at some point, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4106.04s)]
*  this is what Tom Brady did in the Patriots for the last 10 years. He was there and he made the [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4110.679999999999s)]
*  money back off the court. You mentioned the Clippers for him. And that's how this whole [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4114.2s)]
*  thing started. Cause I had heard there was a little Clippers buzz. I can't figure out how it [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4119.959999999999s)]
*  works. There'd have to be a third team that third team would have to be really excited about [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4124.84s)]
*  acquiring James Harden or Norm Powell and Bogdanovic together. I think he goes there to play with [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4129.64s)]
*  Harden. Durant. Okay. I think that's part of why the Clippers have at least thought about it. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4135.16s)]
*  I'm not, is Zubats in the deal? He's not? Okay. Fuck off. And I think that's why, as I said, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4141.88s)]
*  I think that's why the Clippers will not end up with Kevin Durant. Yeah. So can we just shut that [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4147.4800000000005s)]
*  down? Because Zubats isn't going to be in the deal. I mean, I'm sure the Clippers would love to [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4151.72s)]
*  have Kevin Durant. Shut it down if you want. You can actually trade something for him because [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4157.240000000001s)]
*  you're not getting it from Norm Powell and Batum and Kriston and Bogdanovic and a shitty pick. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4160.04s)]
*  You have to really think that the Suns would value the Clippers unprotected 2030 pick, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4165.240000000001s)]
*  a Clippers unprotected 2031 swap, and a Clippers unprotected 2032 pick. Like really, just as the [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4174.04s)]
*  Thunder have profited by betting against the Clippers long-term future, the Suns think. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4180.6s)]
*  Well, so you're saying the Suns, the stupidest team in the 21st century since the mid 2000s Knicks [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4186.200000000001s)]
*  with draft picks. Like nobody has been more reckless and stupid with the concept of future picks. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4192.84s)]
*  Maybe since Ted Steepien in the 80s, that Bradley Beale trade and all the swaps and shit they did [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4201.160000000001s)]
*  is some of the stupidest shit in the recent history of the league. So you're saying now that they [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4208.2s)]
*  would care about getting swaps with the Clippers? I think that there's no way. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4212.28s)]
*  I just don't think they value draft picks. The Suns are going to have to look in the mirror and think, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4219.0s)]
*  and like we traded present talent, really good present day talent, and really good every pick [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4225.0s)]
*  we had to get Kevin Durant. Now we're trading Kevin Durant, and we're not going to be able to [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4233.72s)]
*  have the buffet of everything that we traded for him. We're going to have to choose on a sliding [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4239.72s)]
*  scale of salary relief, which is very important to us, draft picks, and win now talent because [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4245.96s)]
*  Devin Booker is still on our team. And we're just not going to check all those boxes to the degree [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4252.200000000001s)]
*  that we want. No. They basically, they spent $10 million on a house that was worth seven, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4256.76s)]
*  and now they have to sell it for five. And that's it. And it was like, well, I should get 10. I paid [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4262.36s)]
*  10. It's like, you're getting five. And look, that's how this is playing out. I have no idea what's [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4268.92s)]
*  going to happen with Devin Booker. I really do believe there is that from what I've heard that [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4273.88s)]
*  Devin Booker really likes the idea of being a one team player, like a Kobe for Phoenix. He's talked [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4277.48s)]
*  a lot about Kobe Bryant, what he means to him and all that. But if they come out of this trade with [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4285.16s)]
*  something that doesn't excite me for the next two or three years, like a player that I could be like, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4290.68s)]
*  oh, that guy's fun to play with. And we know the Beale thing is not going anywhere. He won't be on, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4295.320000000001s)]
*  he's not a long term part of the Phoenix Suns future. I'm looking around if I'm Devin Booker, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4301.0s)]
*  like, is there a plan here of like, what is happening? And he's already talked about, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4305.8s)]
*  we were so close in the finals not that long ago, and now what's happened to our team? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4313.4800000000005s)]
*  And if you're Matt Ischbia, you have to look in the mirror and you wonder, wait, that's Isaiah Thomas [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4318.92s)]
*  standing right behind me. It doesn't even work for me. Oh wait, he does. He's my conciliar for some [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4324.76s)]
*  reason, but we're all pretending he's not. Boy, there's some good stories about that one. It's [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4330.52s)]
*  not great in Phoenix. Have you heard the stories about how he FaceTimes in the meetings? No. Yeah. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4336.04s)]
*  Might have been a coach interview or two or more, where he was on FaceTime in the meeting. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4341.64s)]
*  Everybody say Nick Rocks. One, two, three, Nick Rocks. One, two, three, Jordan Ott rocks. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4353.08s)]
*  Jordan Ott does rock, by the way. He's going to be a good coach. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4359.8s)]
*  I'm putting the odds, I'm putting the odds on Giannis getting traded this summer at minus, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4362.04s)]
*  not getting traded at like minus 400. That's a lot. I think he stays. That's a lot. I think [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4368.52s)]
*  he stays and walk and I think he wants to stay. They definitely wanted to stay. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4374.52s)]
*  I think there's going to be less action than people think because then Garland got the toe [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4379.56s)]
*  surgery, so cross him out. I wouldn't have traded Garland anyway. Me neither. I would have if you [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4383.08s)]
*  gave me something incredible back for him. So Giannis, he's also had a couple tweets about [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4390.12s)]
*  getting back to the finals. I hope we get back to the finals the last couple of days. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4396.2s)]
*  The interview where he talked about the bucks getting back to the finals. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4400.04s)]
*  I would still go not minus 400. I would go like minus 200. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4404.2s)]
*  Okay. Did you see his I miss Woj tweet? I thought that was weird. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4407.88s)]
*  Yeah. That didn't really get where. Does he feel like things are being misreported? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4411.5599999999995s)]
*  I miss Woj, but I don't know. The insinuation from a tweet like that is things are getting [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4417.48s)]
*  misreported, which I actually agree with because he's never said anything other than he's going [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4423.32s)]
*  to be back in Milwaukee. And even when Shams did that weird media thing on that Monday where it's [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4429.5599999999995s)]
*  like, he's open to the possibility that it's like, did he ask for a trade? He didn't. So he's open [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4434.5199999999995s)]
*  to thinking about the future. Okay, cool. Who doesn't think about the future? It's not a story. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4442.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know. It's a story if he says Janis went to the bucks today and said, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4450.28s)]
*  I think I'm ready to be traded. But by all accounts, he hasn't said that. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4455.5599999999995s)]
*  And by the way, if you're Janis, I'm watching this Pacers team that is now two wins from the finals [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4460.28s)]
*  and has won 14 playoff games. And I'm like, we were right there with those dudes in round one. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4465.8s)]
*  Right. They lost in five, but they lost two of the stupidest games of the playoffs to them. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4471.24s)]
*  Yeah. The only problem with that is after round one comes round two, round three, and round four. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4476.84s)]
*  I get it. But I'm saying if I'm Janis talking myself into Milwaukee, whether it's salvageable. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4483.320000000001s)]
*  Well, Eric Niem has talked about the gap year concept at the athletic and, you know, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4488.4400000000005s)]
*  it's an interesting concept. I just don't know. Is it a gap year? Like how do you make it just one [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4497.56s)]
*  year when you have very little draft equity at all and not that many? You're saying no, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4503.08s)]
*  it dames out for the year. Yeah. Like, like, but how do you make it just one year? Like how do you [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4508.44s)]
*  say, well, by 2026, 27, we're going to be ready to, ready to rock again. Like, so you don't think [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4513.08s)]
*  Kevin Porter and Janis can be the new big two and coups, rejuvenated coups, take the summer seriously. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4519.64s)]
*  I didn't know. I have a question for you guys. You a question? Yeah. A 1 a.m. question. Yeah. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4528.44s)]
*  I didn't listen to the whole pod with Ryan yet. Yeah. Someone told me today that you, you, you were [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4533.879999999999s)]
*  and I don't know if this is right. That's why I'm asking you. You were very confident that Philly [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4539.879999999999s)]
*  is going to try to trade the number three pick. Is that person summarizing you inaccurately or? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4545.32s)]
*  I am confident that they're exploring all options with the pick. Well, yeah. Whether they actually [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4551.0s)]
*  find a trade they like. But I think, I think, uh, I'm pretty confident that they're at least, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4556.84s)]
*  I just think that's how Darrell has operated his entire career. They should, he's going to look at [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4565.16s)]
*  every possible option. And then if it makes the most sense to do three and Paul George for something [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4569.56s)]
*  or however they want to do it, I think there's some really good dudes in this top five though. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4573.88s)]
*  And when they start working out and talking to them, they're going to, my guess would be, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4579.64s)]
*  they'll fall in love with one of the guys and that'll be that there's a guy, uh, I've started [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4583.32s)]
*  to do my work. There's two guys that I think you're really going to dig this edge cone. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4588.44s)]
*  Yeah. I've watched them easily could have played in the game we watched today and at least just [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4594.44s)]
*  athletically hung in. And then this Trey Johnson could be pretty exciting. Uh, as an offensive, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4598.759999999999s)]
*  he's six four there. They have to decide max in McCain. If you're adding a third, like six, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4607.48s)]
*  three to six, five guide to that, then what does that mean? Is McCain your six man? I mean, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4613.639999999999s)]
*  you could look at it. And Grimes too, like Grimes is something. Right. But I mean, you look at the [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4619.24s)]
*  Indiana model, it's like the more guards, the better, in my opinion, just the way basketball [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4623.48s)]
*  is going. So Indiana's guards are big and tough other than, you know, Halliburton is not, is not [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4628.36s)]
*  like Albert and skinny, but like he's still tall. Nemheart's tough. Matherin's tough. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4634.04s)]
*  Have you changed your who who's in the best situation for the next five years in the East [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4639.4s)]
*  dancer now that we've gotten further along in the finals? Cause you did a thing with was after I [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4643.8s)]
*  talked to Ryan about it. I didn't, I said, Indiana was one, you had Cleveland one, Ryan had Cleveland [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4648.92s)]
*  one. I think was that Cleveland one. Look, if they win the championship, it's just, you just win, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4653.72s)]
*  like you win all the polls. So yes, if they win, I guess I would have to, I guess I would have to, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4659.16s)]
*  there are two, one in the finals or a championship. I thought you made, I thought Ryan made a good [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4664.12s)]
*  case. I think was made a good, or you and was both made the Cleveland case. I think is the right [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4667.88s)]
*  answer because it's the only other candidate. You have the most options with Mowby Garland and [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4673.16s)]
*  Mitchell. Even if it's not working out with those as your best three and Alan, they still have a lot [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4678.68s)]
*  of different things they could do. That would be why, but if Indiana wins the title. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4684.76s)]
*  Yeah. If you win the title, you just win all the polls for a little while. That's all. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4691.400000000001s)]
*  And there are, even if they don't win the title, I will say if Oklahoma city wins the next three [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4695.320000000001s)]
*  games, Indiana has proven itself a championship caliber team. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4699.4800000000005s)]
*  Many of Boston a year ago. It's a Dallas. I'm wondering if this would be the first of a couple [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4705.16s)]
*  titles. Now I'm Jaylen Brown shaving his meniscus. Jaylen Jason Tatum day 27 of Achilles rehab. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4711.96s)]
*  Drew holiday, poor Zingas trade rumors. I don't know what happened. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4721.56s)]
*  I mean, do we know what happened with them in a hotel room in Indiana with you one in the morning [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4725.64s)]
*  talking about Kevin Durant, if he likes Texas or not, what happened to my Celtics life? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4729.72s)]
*  I mean, we don't even know what happened to poor Zingas. Like still don't know. Yeah. We'd love [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4735.08s)]
*  an answer on that at some point. Some sort of medical verdict. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4739.88s)]
*  Did anything happen? The ultimate, the ultimate team. Look, we're getting a little groggy now, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4746.4400000000005s)]
*  but the ultimate team, when you say like, what happened, what happened to us? We're just like [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4752.52s)]
*  looking around like, what? How do we get here? Is Sacramento? Just looking around like, how did we [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4756.36s)]
*  become the bulls? Like the mediocre bull? That's who we are now. And like, but with Sabonis, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4761.96s)]
*  we, how is this our team? Like Zach Levine makes how much? Demar, Demar DeRozan's like around [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4769.4s)]
*  doing stuff. Malik Monk's our point guard. What happened? How about we had Halliburton? Yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4775.799999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. Like, how did we get here? The beam team was so fun. God, I hated that trade [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4781.96s)]
*  for them. How did, what happened? I think I went, I haven't heard the pod editor about it, but I think [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4788.28s)]
*  I said, I think I went all in on that one. That I thought it was a massive mistake by them. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4793.5599999999995s)]
*  Cause you know, when we are, we talk about stuff after thing and I'm like, I think this, I think [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4800.839999999999s)]
*  that, and then occasionally it's like, I feel so strongly about this. I want to put some, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4804.679999999999s)]
*  can you put this down in Penn? I just couldn't believe they traded them. So let's go back to, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4809.0s)]
*  let's now we're really- And by the way, the Sabonis thing, they got good value and it turned out it [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4816.04s)]
*  was a good trade for both sides. I get it. But I just, I just never ever would have traded him. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4820.12s)]
*  Not a win-win. The ultimate one though, you put, and many people put the flag down most aggressively [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4824.44s)]
*  on was go bear. And so it's interesting to think now, like- I still have no regrets on that one. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4830.28s)]
*  I don't think you should. It is undeniable that they have gotten further as a franchise than they [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4835.32s)]
*  have ever gotten before two years in a row. And yet it still feels like, how? Like they gave up so much [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4841.08s)]
*  to get him. But like- I will say this. The one thing I was definitely wrong about, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4850.76s)]
*  and I remember saying this as a critique of the trade was you, that trade when Anthony Edwards is [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4855.5599999999995s)]
*  like 24, 25 and he's close to hitting his prime. I think the, the, the thing they saw that I guess [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4859.8s)]
*  none of us saw was that he was way closer to being a top seven guy than I think we thought. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4865.96s)]
*  And these really interesting thing about it was part of the reason that a lot of us didn't like [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4871.4s)]
*  that trade at first blush and even at second and third blush was, well, it's just, you're just [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4875.32s)]
*  inevitably going to have to trade talents because the salary crunch is just, you're just not going [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4881.16s)]
*  to be able to have these guys and he's the obvious guy. Like you're not obviously not going to trade [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4885.639999999999s)]
*  ant. Um, oh man, we didn't talk about the real topic of, uh, the finals, the, the next coaching [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4889.4s)]
*  search, the fact that the next are back. Quinn, Quinn Snyder, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4897.16s)]
*  this whole thing where you just asked for permission for people under contract. I've never [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4903.16s)]
*  heard of such a thing. It's, it's, it's everybody, but Steve Kern's bolster, Quinn Snyder, Billy [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4907.08s)]
*  Donovan, uh, email, Chris Finch. I think we're even missing one Jason kid, Jason kid. That's the one [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4911.8s)]
*  I was missing at this point. If you're a coach and they haven't, it's like, what do I, do I suck? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4918.84s)]
*  Like why are the next call? Yeah. I just hit that point where you start to, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4923.88s)]
*  you start to wonder, is it you? Um, I don't know what they do. If I were them, I've just hired [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4927.64s)]
*  Taylor Jenkins. I thought he was a really good coach and I think you could explain his lack of [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4937.88s)]
*  success in Memphis. I mean, he was successful, but can you say control Z on the tips thing? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4943.72s)]
*  It's like, Hey, the papers are, aren't dry, aren't handed in yet. I saw the ad in the times that you [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4949.4800000000005s)]
*  place the message, a little letter in the times really touching, really, really tugged on my [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4956.76s)]
*  heartstrings. Wait, is Taylor Jenkins, what was wrong with him? Nothing. I just think that if you're [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4964.12s)]
*  the New York Knicks and you've made the conference finals, you fired your coach, who's this 67 year [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4972.12s)]
*  old veteran, whatever he is coach, um, with a mandate to win the championship. I just don't [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4976.76s)]
*  think you're going to the guy who was in the like little small market over here. Like I don't think [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4983.48s)]
*  James don't even know who Taylor Jenkins is. I think Taylor Jenkins is an awesome coach and he [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4988.12s)]
*  would be toward the top of my list. If not at the top of it too, even he has the readymade [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4993.639999999999s)]
*  explanation of, yeah, things were going really well. And then crazy shit started happening with [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=4998.44s)]
*  my star player. Oh, and Brandon Clark was my glue guy and he just kept getting season ending injuries. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5003.48s)]
*  I can't believe the name that I'm surprised hasn't come up as Vogel just because veteran coach, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5009.24s)]
*  likable personality, New York area ties. And I was talking to some people about that today [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5015.0s)]
*  and the word retread came up like too much of a retread. I'm like, well, okay. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5021.5599999999995s)]
*  I think that's a little unfair to him because like Phoenix is just, I just think everyone gets [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5025.719999999999s)]
*  a pass for getting fired in Phoenix. It's almost like a badge of honor. It's like the zoo caper in [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5030.92s)]
*  a zoo where the bears attacked a lion and it's like, wow, is the zoo caper spot? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5035.4s)]
*  Well, and also they at least like made the playoffs and the Lakers, he wins a championship, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5041.16s)]
*  gets fired at amid the rust disaster. And like, you know, I think Vogel is a good coach. Yeah. I [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5046.12s)]
*  mean, like I just, I'm surprised that name hasn't come up. A lot of the dots make sense of just like [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5052.759999999999s)]
*  veteran coach. How funny is it going to be when they hire Mike Woodson? I can't, you can't. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5057.48s)]
*  You could not that funny to Nick's fans. I don't know. Would you bet your life that they [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5063.4s)]
*  wouldn't hire Mike Woodson? I wouldn't bet my life on anything. Nick's related. They just called six [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5069.24s)]
*  coaches in 24 hours just for fun. Hey, Atlanta. Hey, Atlanta. No, they were so competent. Also, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5074.04s)]
*  like whoever gets the job has to keep the best players dad on the team as an assistant coach. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5082.12s)]
*  Not exactly like enticing. So I get to coach in the New York fish bowl. I'm expected to win a title. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5088.2s)]
*  There's a weird coaching staff situation that by the way, a lot of people are talking about [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5095.4s)]
*  underneath in the undergrounds. It's not great. Would you, here's the question. If you were Leon [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5099.48s)]
*  Rose or whoever's making the calls, let's just say Leon Rose. Yeah. Would you even have the guts, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5104.12s)]
*  the gall, the audacity to call Pat Riley? Would just to do it like, hey, we've got to check this [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5111.96s)]
*  bowl box. Like we've got to see, like, don't we have to see given Riley's history with that? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5117.639999999999s)]
*  Would you even do it just to do it? I housed her at Spoh initially when this all started. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5124.5199999999995s)]
*  You screen-shotted his text. I thought he seemed miserable last season. That was the only [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5130.599999999999s)]
*  thing about it that made me pause for a second. See, I disagree with you on one level. When they [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5137.0s)]
*  were losing, what did they have like an eight or nine game losing streak at some point when it was [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5144.52s)]
*  all coming apart for them? And he, in one of the press conferences said, you know, like, actually, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5147.56s)]
*  I just, I love this. Like I love that we have to get together as a group and dig out of this. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5152.6s)]
*  He's not, that's not like Spoh speak. He really loves like, well, not only did they not dig out, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5156.84s)]
*  not only did not dig out, they had like an embarrassing exit. Yeah, it wasn't great. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5163.56s)]
*  The calves just traipsing all over Miami and Max Drews. And so if I was Miami, I would [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5170.12s)]
*  all time blow it up. I would trade BAM. I wouldn't do the hero extension. I would trade Spoh to the [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5177.32s)]
*  Knicks. I would just completely blow it up. Yeah, I just, I completely blow it up. It seems like [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5184.6s)]
*  they're going to go the other way. And like their kick of the tires at Durant too. I was just [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5191.32s)]
*  imagining the most preposterous phone call possible is Leon Rose calling Pat Riley about [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5195.48s)]
*  Eric Spolcher. That's the most preposterous thing. I'm really rooting for that to come out. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5199.88s)]
*  Well, with the concern they've called everybody else, like, would you be shocked? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5204.2s)]
*  I would be a little shocked. We have to go because now my head's starting to hurt. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5211.96s)]
*  Um, so we're going to come back on Friday night on your podcast, the Zach Lowe show. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5216.28s)]
*  We're not going to be live, but we're going to come after game four. We're going to do the [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5224.28s)]
*  exact same setup. Hopefully we figure out, we'll learn from the kinks. We only had one stop and [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5227.08s)]
*  start this time around. Um, but, uh, we were going to do that and it'll be up on your YouTube channel [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5232.04s)]
*  as well. Um, this will be on my YouTube channel. This will be a video podcast on Spotify as well. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5238.12s)]
*  Hopefully, hopefully that everything works. Yeah. Hopefully everything worked. Uh, thanks to [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5245.08s)]
*  Gahao and Eduardo as well for, uh, for producing for us. And thanks to Zach Lowe. I'll see you, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5248.12s)]
*  uh, I'll see you in Indy tomorrow, but yeah, we're here. Game four real stakes. Love a great, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5253.72s)]
*  great. What did we say? Magical or calamity or magical calamity or magical. Got to work on that. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5258.36s)]
*  That's every Pacers game is like that. They've had five calamity or magical games in one [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5264.04s)]
*  playoff run was game one against the Knicks, a calamity or magical magical. I'm going magical [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5269.4s)]
*  across the board. What a great place this is. All right. Uh, I'll see you. Uh, I'll see you tomorrow [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QszNT5fvkMw&t=5273.56s)]
