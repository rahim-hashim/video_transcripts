# Most Fun NBA League Pass Teams From 1-30 With CR, Wos and Mahoney  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOpC9dqUCOo)
*  Here with Chris Ryan, the Charles Nelson Riley of The Ringer.
*  He's on 17 podcasts this week.
*  This is the one that counts though, man.
*  This is the one that matters.
*  I appreciate that, C.R.
*  Big Was.
*  Yes, sir.
*  How are you?
*  I'm happy.
*  Good to see you.
*  You're happy.
*  Yeah, you love This Is Your Time of Year.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Especially like, Hope Springs Eternal for all of these teams.
*  For at least the next month.
*  And the one and only Rob Mahoney.
*  Hi.
*  Who's somehow breaking down the NBA again and not weird shows on Apple.
*  It's getting weirder.
*  I can't eat you both.
*  We'll find out.
*  What's that new show with Kevin Klein?
*  We're my neighbor.
*  Yeah.
*  My mom was like this best show in a while.
*  My mom's 76.
*  She hasn't gotten to episode five yet.
*  I can tell you.
*  She likes super weird.
*  So anyway, it seems disturbing.
*  So we're going to do League Pass rankings, which is great because we're actually supposed
*  to do this on Tuesday and fate intervened.
*  I got super sick.
*  But I'm glad we got to see Two Days of Games because I feel like this is a better way to do it.
*  Now I have a better feel for the season.
*  So shout out to Zach Lowe.
*  Back in the day at Grandland, we came up with the League Pass rankings, I think in 12 or 13.
*  We had five categories.
*  I went back and read what the categories were.
*  They're going to shape what we do for this.
*  So you can't just be you can't just say Brooklyn's my number one because literally why would you?
*  Yeah.
*  Who did you think was that?
*  Wait till we get to Brooklyn.
*  All right.
*  Category number one is relevancy of the playoff picture.
*  Category number two is her hoop nerdgasm potential.
*  Category number three is the League Pass experience, which was a big passion of Zach's and still is.
*  Announcing teams, sideline reporting, uniforms, the mascot.
*  Like the Clippers last night just was a 10 out of 10 with how weird that was.
*  Fucking guy came out of the rafters.
*  What's that guy's name?
*  Their mascot dropped from the rafters.
*  I actually don't know.
*  Owen Hart style was terrifying.
*  Yeah, that was going on.
*  Yeah, they have like they're all excited.
*  I was mesmerized by the wall.
*  But I didn't see the mascot.
*  Well, the wall was cool.
*  All right.
*  Are we sure it wasn't James Harden?
*  He didn't come down?
*  No.
*  Category number four, individual player appeal.
*  And then category number five, the most important for all of us is unintentional comedy,
*  irrational affection, and personality intangibles.
*  I'm just going to make this easy.
*  CR, I'm giving you first pick.
*  Oh, you are?
*  And we'll just go around.
*  Okay.
*  There's no stank fashion.
*  Okay.
*  There's no real way to win this.
*  So we'll just get started.
*  You didn't want to do any headlines.
*  You didn't want to ask any embed questions.
*  Nothing.
*  We'll get there.
*  Billy will be mentioned.
*  It's up in the pod.
*  And as we hit each pod, each team will talk about, you know, variables.
*  Like is your best player ever going to play?
*  Why did they give him an extension when he's not helping?
*  Those are questions we'll ask.
*  We're not there yet.
*  With the first pick, I'm going to go with the Minnesota Timberwolves.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Explain.
*  Ant is my favorite current professional athlete.
*  Wow.
*  Cool.
*  I think even within...
*  Over Angel Reese?
*  In a day and a half, he has managed to already make like hilarious content out of one game
*  where he told Bronnie he didn't need to take a shower.
*  I love that so much.
*  He yelled at Vanderbilt and said, you haven't played in two years.
*  Yeah.
*  It seemed angry about it.
*  Did Vanderbilt chirp at him?
*  Like what happened?
*  They used to be teammates.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a familiarity factor.
*  The Bronn anything killed me.
*  If there was a premium tier to pay $1,000 for season to have Ant miked,
*  and it was just going into my AirPods, I don't even know if $1,000 would be too high.
*  I would pay pretty much anything and I would just spend it to you.
*  Well, there's a new level with Swagger with him because now he played with all the best guys.
*  Yeah.
*  So now he's on the court with LeBron and he's just like, fine, I'll talk shit with him.
*  Yeah, and LeBron probably edited him out of starting five a little bit so he didn't steal the show.
*  Then you add the Dante piece, which is this weird revenge tour that he's on that seems to be
*  metastasizing beyond even the Knicks.
*  And it's like, he's angry and playing hard.
*  I think that they're just going to have like a tougher,
*  more competitive, more fuck you team without Kat.
*  Don't forget the go bear piece.
*  And there's go bear.
*  Yeah, there's go bear just going out there and getting choked out.
*  So I think it's just a really exciting night to night team
*  that's going to be in the mix for the title.
*  Just to tear down your team right off the bat.
*  How do you feel about the thing you love most watching Anthony Edwards play basketball,
*  being actively stifled, every possession by Julius Randall doing
*  jab steps?
*  Whatever it is that Julius Randall wants to do.
*  You don't like Julius Randall jab steps?
*  I actually, I'm like a big supporter of Kentucky alumnus across the board.
*  So I'm excited actually, because I also think Randall at least is saying the right things.
*  Where he's like, you know what, I can pass.
*  I've just been in situations where they've asked me to take 26 shots a game.
*  So I'm sure it'll clog up the lane a little bit.
*  I told Woz before we started that I had Minnesota second and I moved them down
*  six spots after watching Randall for two hours.
*  I was just like, wow, I just don't like watching.
*  Forgot, I just don't like watching him play basketball.
*  Nothing personal.
*  I'm sure he's a great guy.
*  But I bet for all of us, Minnesota's towards the top of the board, right?
*  100%.
*  They're fun.
*  They're interesting.
*  They're going to be good and competing for things.
*  And the go bear part of it, like having a guy on your team that everybody else wants to dunk on,
*  rockets them up a ranking like this.
*  Also, speaking of Kentucky alumnus Dillingham, I'm like already like.
*  Do we think he's going to play?
*  When he does, I think he's jumping out of the building.
*  Gotcha.
*  It would be funny if there was like an actor or an actress like go bear
*  that everybody who did a scene with them just wanted to destroy them.
*  Maybe he was like Taye Diggs.
*  People are saying, I fucking destroyed Taye Diggs.
*  Go bear brings something special out of everybody's got a grip of them.
*  There's like American foreign stuff with them.
*  There's defensive player.
*  There's inter French beef.
*  Yeah, he's just despised.
*  That's bizarre.
*  He's the individual version of like Memphis who like everybody hates as a team.
*  Rudy's just that individual for every single NBA player.
*  Listen, the guys hate him.
*  I didn't agree with the first pick, but I see you.
*  I see you, CR.
*  I see you.
*  You've been putting the word CR.
*  I see you, Chris Ryan.
*  What do you have for number two, Was?
*  My number, man, I didn't know I was going to be put in this position.
*  To draft?
*  Yeah.
*  You know what?
*  I'm going to go with Oklahoma City.
*  This is the pick.
*  Which I think everybody's really excited about watching them.
*  It's not just Shay.
*  It's JDub.
*  It's Chet for me specifically.
*  I'm a big, big Chet guy.
*  The new additions, Hardenstein got hurt.
*  A lot of people said I jinxed it because I said on our pod, I said their depth was unbeatable.
*  And then he got hurt the next day.
*  What power you have.
*  Well, we did the over-under.
*  We all did over-lock 57 and a half.
*  And I think he broke his hand listening to the podcast.
*  But I still think they can hit it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just young guys.
*  My favorite thing about League Pass outside of great teams is a sense of discovery watching guys
*  week after week learn new things, beat new things.
*  Or teams discover things about them and then they overcome that adjustment by other teams.
*  So I think OKC has it all.
*  They have the top to bottom talent and then they have this sense that you're going to be
*  learning new things about their potential every single week.
*  Yeah.
*  And every single game.
*  It's not even like is this guy having a great week?
*  It's oh, I didn't know Kays and Walls could do that.
*  I didn't know these guys could pop off in that way.
*  And they're so deep.
*  They have so many interesting players.
*  I'm not worried about the Thunder to say the least.
*  I think they're going to be awesome.
*  Do you think there's any like it's like too predictable how good they're going to be?
*  No.
*  I was thinking about this.
*  I would love like a crazy mid-season, Koki, Presti move.
*  Like trade for Kawhi.
*  Just do something nuts to like upset the Apple cart.
*  He's never done it one time in his entire career.
*  I think the Hayward thing also probably scared him off of doing that ever again, too.
*  They've even elicited a terrible Kendrick Perkins take before the season started.
*  What was that take?
*  How SGA needs to cut his scoring down to 24 points a game and get other guys involved.
*  It's very specific.
*  It's like other guys involved.
*  He's like one of the most inclusive stars we have.
*  He is the driving kickoff.
*  It's like him and Steph Curry.
*  Where are the producers on those shows?
*  It's like no, Kendrick.
*  No, please don't say that.
*  I like the discovery thing.
*  I especially like with League Pass day in, day out when guys get scratched, guys aren't playing,
*  or you're just flipping around in second quarters.
*  I like I feel like for League Pass, you need kind of a bench that could either be really good or really weird.
*  Yeah.
*  Really weird is like there's a couple teams that we'll get to where you're just like, wow, this guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Which I think is fun.
*  Now that burns off what by November, December.
*  You're like, all right.
*  But that's where them having all this stuff to trade, even if it isn't a Coke-y trade.
*  They could mix it up anytime they want to.
*  And they could have a slightly different team or a very different team by February.
*  And I think that potential makes them super watchable too.
*  This is a good character for us to develop is Coke Presti.
*  Coked up Presti.
*  And what he could do with all these picks.
*  So it's like Saul Rubenek in True Romance.
*  Screaming at Gordon Award, you stabbed me in the heart.
*  All right.
*  OK, so now you're up, Rob.
*  This is I feel like this is a easy pick, but you won't make it.
*  What does that mean?
*  I don't think you're going to make the pick you should make.
*  I'm going to take the San Antonio Spurs.
*  Wow.
*  Easy reason, straightforward reason.
*  Although, look, I'm also going to talk here off about Chris Paul and how much I'm looking
*  forward to seeing him there.
*  I just have no idea what Wimby is capable of.
*  And I very much look forward to seeing what that is.
*  And Paul's already resting?
*  Don't worry about it.
*  OK.
*  Don't worry about it.
*  He's going to be fine.
*  Chris Paul is theoretical.
*  Theoretical?
*  Yeah, he's like Kawhi Leonard.
*  Their bodies are shot.
*  That's incredibly rude.
*  They're not going to play.
*  These guys don't play.
*  But the reason why, look, I was quite idiotically skeptical of Wimby.
*  Very vocally skeptical.
*  Performatively America first skeptical.
*  Yeah, I was like, oh, what?
*  He did it in the French league.
*  Give me a break.
*  Do it in the ACC.
*  Obviously, I was wrong.
*  But my thing about the Spurs, while they're lower on my list, I don't care about anybody
*  else on that team.
*  Not a one other player do I get geeked to watch.
*  Even though Wimby is, yes, he's transcended.
*  But I like to pick.
*  You're not into Harrison Barnes like that?
*  Harry Barnes doesn't do it for me.
*  Poor Harry.
*  No, but Stephon Castle, though, they do have interesting young guys.
*  He's a nice rookie, yeah.
*  Some pop, some intrigue.
*  Obviously, everything that Wimby.
*  Sohan at the point?
*  I'm the...
*  Come on.
*  Yeah.
*  Stephon Castle?
*  Yeah.
*  UConn?
*  I hated the feeling last season when you would watch the Spurs and Wimby would have like...
*  He'd be drawing like a triple double in the first quarter and then pop.
*  Would just go against all vibes and just pull him out for like most of the second or, you know,
*  sit him like, we're just like unrepentant.
*  Just like we're managing it.
*  We're managing it.
*  It's like people want to watch this guy explode.
*  Let's go.
*  Yeah.
*  I had them like in the eight to 10 range because I'm with Waz.
*  I really only want to watch Wimby.
*  I don't know if Castle's ready yet.
*  But the thing with Wimby is anytime he gets going or makes some crazy play,
*  I'm going to see it on my phone in five seconds, right?
*  So all the stuff that he did last year or when he had like the 17 points and six minutes in
*  third quarter, like you start hearing about it as it's happening.
*  Just go over and get it.
*  So I don't know.
*  I still don't know what this team wants to be.
*  They're not going to be that good yet.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't feel like they will and they're over and under.
*  I thought it was pretty high, but there's some people really going in on them being good.
*  I just think Chris Paul's too old.
*  I'm with Waz.
*  Like all of the evidence in NBA history is against point guards, little guys at his age
*  being really good.
*  I don't see it.
*  He's not going to play a ton of games, but when he is out there,
*  he will actually throw the ball to Victor Webinama, which is something that they needed.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think I hear your point about the highlights.
*  I think it's well founded.
*  The thing you will miss is Webinama trying shit that doesn't work.
*  And he has some of the most elaborate and incredible,
*  like near highlights of any player in the league.
*  The time he jumps at a ball, but can't quite block it or goal tends it.
*  The threes he'll attempt.
*  Like I want to see all that stuff in addition to the great highlight plays.
*  I have Orlando at number four.
*  That's the team that I should have drafted?
*  Well, I'm not talking down to him.
*  I love the magic.
*  Here's why.
*  I have a bunch of bunch of reasons.
*  One is I think they're really fun to watch.
*  Two, Sarutti's here and I just wanted to make a big smile.
*  On his face for those at home.
*  Three, I think they're the discovery team this year along the lines of what OKC was last year.
*  And we were banking on this when we did the over-under.
*  I know you guys like them too.
*  Like the 47 wins last year felt like of any team in the league,
*  them or Cleveland had a chance to jump.
*  But I loved what they did last night.
*  There was a real killer instinct with them.
*  Palo is clearly just a level higher than he was last year.
*  And I want to just watch them because I don't know what their ceiling is.
*  I watched last night and I know it's early.
*  I'm not trying to overreact after one game.
*  And I want to see the Knicks game 25.
*  I'm not going to judge the Knicks after one game.
*  Let's wait till 25.
*  Let's see when Mitchell Robinson comes back.
*  But Orlando is really fucking hard to play.
*  And Sarutti made the key point when we're talking about today.
*  They can just play well for six minutes and go on like a 19 to 1 run.
*  And you're like, they're almost like a football team that can score points in bunches.
*  They're just really scary.
*  I was scared last night watching them for the Celtics.
*  And then the Palo piece is the X factor for a league pass.
*  He's just going to have nights where he puts up 38 and 20 and nine assists.
*  So that's my fourth pick.
*  What I like about them too for a league pass team is their style is very distinct.
*  Nobody's as physical as they are.
*  Nobody's as downhill as they are.
*  Their entire core is young guys who are still trying to establish and prove themselves.
*  That's what I really like about Orlando.
*  It's like you're not going to watch a team that plays that style where they're just hitting you.
*  The entire freaking game.
*  Several teams in the Eastern Conference, especially the favorites,
*  are all kind of like on an almost organizational load management program.
*  You know, you're like, oh yeah, you guys are going to build up to the spring.
*  There's a couple like this one, the one that I might pick next,
*  that you're like, man, every single night I bet you guys are going to go for it.
*  Yeah, they're going to have to protect these things from playing.
*  Yeah, so I think that's a cool pick.
*  There's also a version of a defense first team that is not that fun to watch.
*  That's like a real slog.
*  The Magic are not that.
*  Like, watch Jalen Suggs play defense.
*  He's flying around.
*  He's hounding everybody.
*  He's going to make every guard's life miserable.
*  Talking tons of shit, but great vibes on the Magic side.
*  Like, they have so many guys who are very physical but super watchable.
*  So one other thing with this from a league pass standpoint,
*  because they did and they started this last year where they basically show the
*  Jumbotron camera during the timeouts.
*  So you just stay with the feed.
*  Orlando's got one of the most lit crowds.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just cougars everywhere.
*  Yeah, it's a lot of off season pro golfers.
*  Off season.
*  Yeah, weird celebrities like golfers and NASCAR drivers.
*  There's older rich guys sitting in the front row with some wife that's like
*  40 years younger than him.
*  I just, I actually really see Rob shaking.
*  I really enjoy their timeout stuff.
*  Rob's trying to do a trip to Disney World.
*  I'm just trying to get out of this room.
*  I'm just trying to get away from this table right now.
*  Cougar Central, the Orlando Magic.
*  It's pretty funny.
*  All right, Chris, you're up.
*  All right.
*  Number five pick.
*  So there's an extra element I'll just throw into one of Zach's criteria there,
*  which is something that's more recent for me, but it is fantasy.
*  And I got Mowgli this season.
*  And let me tell you, small theater sample size.
*  Yeah.
*  Mowgli.
*  Mowgli and the Atkinson program might be incredible.
*  And we've been waiting for this like Tim Duncan next generation thing to happen.
*  It's only one game.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think that Cleveland looks like the kind of team you want to watch every single day.
*  My stockbroker is still hammering me about all my Mowgli position.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like we are just overextended.
*  Is it considered insider trading for I'm also incredibly over leveraged in Evan Mowgli stock?
*  If we talk him up on this pot, is that a crime of some kind?
*  It's very smart.
*  25, 8 and 3 in 27 minutes last night.
*  And that's the other team that kind of has the look a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Like granted one game sample size, but they did all the right things in the off season.
*  They got Mitchell to commit and-
*  And if you're Cleveland, you can't really afford to be like, we'll start playing hard in February.
*  It's like, no, you guys got to like-
*  Yeah, they have to do it now.
*  And I think Atkinson is bringing just a whole new dynamic.
*  Rob mentioned it on the live stream yesterday where he's like, yo Mowgli,
*  we're going to give you the ball and actually allow you to do something with it.
*  We're not going to treat you like some traditional big and give it to you on the block
*  and think you're going to dream shake people to death.
*  Like that's not how he's doing.
*  He's just more creative than the last coaches.
*  And I think that's reason in and of itself, even though like it's the whole team is back from last year.
*  If they're just healthier and more creative on offense specifically, then yeah, they're definitely worth a watch.
*  I also don't want to let the larger conversation about Donovan Mitchell cloud the fact that he's
*  fucking watchable and like-
*  Yeah, super fun.
*  Every time he's on the floor.
*  Super fun to watch.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, especially them against a good team.
*  That's going to be entertaining on the West Coast.
*  Those those central time zone games are very in the sweet spot.
*  If you've gotten home from work, you can throw it on as you're making dinner.
*  You can check in with them.
*  Definitely.
*  Well, six pick.
*  This is easy for me.
*  It's the Philadelphia 76ers for both sides of it.
*  One, because I do think legitimately when everybody's available, this can be a really good to great team.
*  Just the talent that's available.
*  The other thing.
*  So just on a talent contender, we all know that went on paper.
*  The other thing that I like is that I know for a fact the entire fan base is ready to turn on these guys.
*  The second-
*  Ready.
*  The second that-
*  They are ready to kill these dudes.
*  So it's like both of those elements like do they fulfill their potential?
*  Do we just watch one of the worst car crashes of recent memory?
*  Paul George had an excuse.
*  He has a bruised knee.
*  That was hurt.
*  That's a two-week injury.
*  That was a real injury.
*  Yeah.
*  Like my daughter just had that in soccer.
*  It fucking hurt.
*  She was limping around for two weeks.
*  You can't-
*  There's no way to heal it.
*  Embiid is healing from the offseason.
*  That's compared to my daughter and Paul George.
*  He's recovering from the offseason.
*  But the Embiid thing is where-
*  It's hard work losing 25 pounds, right?
*  Yeah, he lost too much weight.
*  That's a lot of cardio.
*  Explain the extension to me, CR.
*  You gotta-
*  Like you're gonna really play like show us, prove it to us with your Embiid?
*  Yeah.
*  How about-
*  Yes.
*  Show me another example in the NBA of that happening right now.
*  As you know, I don't understand why the Corpers did it with Kawhi.
*  I don't understand the point of these extensions when you have no idea if the
*  guy's gonna be healthy three months from now.
*  I'd rather be like-
*  I think they're moving into a new building.
*  Oh man, we should have extended him.
*  He's healthy.
*  They're moving into a new building and they need to have like a stable face of the franchise.
*  And Maxie, for as much as he's beloved in the city, is not there yet.
*  Also, he's awesome?
*  Are we just pretending Joel Embiid's not good?
*  Like he's hurt a lot.
*  The playoff concerns are what they are, but he's an excellent player who I-
*  Like I would be in business with that idea of-
*  He didn't look healthy in the Olympics.
*  He didn't look healthy in the playoffs.
*  And now he's not healthy.
*  That's six months.
*  Yeah, but you're not playing for now.
*  You're hoping that he's healthy by May.
*  Yeah, that's the example of what I was saying where it's like,
*  do you really want to watch the Sixers in December?
*  Probably not.
*  Now-
*  I just want to say no franchise has ever said this before as like a selling point to their
*  fans.
*  We only care about the playoffs.
*  Like-
*  No fucking kidding.
*  Everyone cares about the playoffs.
*  Oh, well, new theory.
*  We only care about the postseason.
*  Okay.
*  The problem with taking that stance if you're the Sixers is that you've never done anything.
*  Right?
*  Like if Boston decided tomorrow, like, yo, we're chilling until the playoffs.
*  It's like, yo, they've been going to finals, conference, finals-
*  He didn't say I'm chilling until the playoffs.
*  He said I want to be as healthy as possible for the playoffs.
*  And that means I'm going to try and monitor my body.
*  I don't care about MVP.
*  I don't care about all NBA.
*  The extension is done.
*  It's all about being healthy.
*  I'm just playing devil's advocate.
*  He wasn't like, I don't give a shit until the playoffs start.
*  I think it, I just think it's a weird decision to treat the regular season like,
*  you know, when you go to a restaurant that there's the 20% gratuity automatically and
*  then they're like, you can put a plus three if you want.
*  And it's like, that's how you're treating the regular season.
*  Like that's plus three.
*  It's optional.
*  Like I didn't mean it's not that important.
*  I've ever, you know, the gratuity is happening already.
*  All right.
*  It's just like, I don't care.
*  That's what it feels like.
*  And it's with a brand new roster construction.
*  Again, like I bring up Boston because they've had sustained success.
*  It's like conference finals, finals all the time for six years.
*  So they're like, look, we get the regular season.
*  We're worried about getting to our final destination.
*  There's credibility there for a team that just got constructed to be like,
*  we're going to figure out what kind of team we are in the playoffs.
*  That doesn't make any sense to me.
*  From a league pass perspective, here's what I'm not looking forward to.
*  Is this exact conversation every time I see a visiting or an opposing broadcast.
*  They didn't make one of the three TVs for me last night.
*  No, thank you.
*  I'll be tuned in as long as two of the big three are in.
*  Did they get bumped off for 2B?
*  No, I had three other games.
*  You can get league pass on three different outlets.
*  A quad box.
*  I had all three.
*  Sorry.
*  Rob, you're a conspiracy guy based on some of your TV watching.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  This is like an Apple TV question.
*  Is this just an excuse that Bede's not healthy?
*  And this is like, they sat in a room for five hours and they were like,
*  let's do a whole, we only care about the playoffs.
*  We just want to get him ready.
*  This is one random quote that you made.
*  You guys are making it sound like they're not healthy.
*  They're not putting up billboards in Philly that say,
*  Sixers, just wait for the playoffs.
*  We're seasoned with this with five years of Kawhi.
*  Okay, I'm just saying because like,
*  this is five years of Kawhi, which same blueprint of like,
*  ah, you know,
*  Leading up to the Paul George injury.
*  I would say that this has been the most enthusiastic people have been about the Sixers in a long time.
*  Like where it was just like, holy shit, this actually worked.
*  You actually did sign a guy into cap space.
*  He actually might be the perfect third wheel.
*  People were enthusiastic for the Joker too.
*  Were they?
*  He drafted him.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, I feel like I have to defend these guys.
*  No, look again, like I said, as long as
*  Joel or Paul George on the two of the big three and Maxie,
*  I'm going to be interested to see how those guys work.
*  Particularly Paul George around Joel Embiid
*  because he's never played with that kind of player before.
*  And Joel's never played.
*  Well, he had the one season of Jimmy, but he's never played with a wing.
*  He's never had a wing.
*  That's also like, I'm happy to be like the beta here.
*  Jimmy was obviously like, you know, he would go in and out of like wanting to be like the
*  playmaker.
*  I hate this.
*  He's also never played with someone like Grisham Yabu Saleh.
*  And I'm not afraid to say it.
*  Yabu.
*  Fun guy.
*  None of this is passing the spell test for me.
*  Okay.
*  None of it.
*  That was Waz's pick.
*  That's my pick.
*  And I think they're putting too much pressure on Maxie because now Maxie is becoming.
*  I remember writing about this a million years ago.
*  It happened with David West in New Orleans.
*  Everybody talked about how great he was so often.
*  It was like he somehow became overrated by not doing anything.
*  And Maxie, it's like, oh, Maxie, I love Maxie.
*  Oh, he could be the face of the franchise.
*  It's like, can we see Maxie like be the best guy in a team for three weeks in a row?
*  Okay.
*  I want to see first of all, Waz picked them.
*  And second of all, this is the league pass rankings draft.
*  And now it's just been like unloading on the Sixers for five minutes.
*  Well, that's what we do.
*  And it's unloading them for them for like what they've done in the playoffs.
*  We glazed the magic.
*  We're just like these guys, fighters every single night.
*  That's right.
*  But I think to me again, I think the human interest of it appeals to me.
*  Joelle's story, Paul George's story, even Darryl's story.
*  The way this team is put together and how all in it feels, that's compelling to me.
*  I'm paying attention.
*  It's a burn the ships team.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Good luck.
*  We're going to take a break and let's see our regroup.
*  All right, coming back.
*  Somehow we've only done six teams.
*  Rob Mahoney is up with pick seven.
*  I'm going to take a team that is in close games all the time.
*  Usually because they're blowing lots of leads.
*  At least that was the case last season.
*  Also crucially on the league pass side of things, as Chris pointed out,
*  I'm going the other side of the time bracket.
*  West Coast, kind of a tough slot this year.
*  Not a lot of teams I'm super invested in except the Sacramento Kings.
*  Give me the Cardiac Kings.
*  They found every way to blow games last year.
*  Now, let's put Demar DeRosa in there.
*  Let's have a closer.
*  Let's have two of the best closers in the league between him and Dier and Fox.
*  It's a weird basketball fit.
*  I want to see if it works.
*  They have an overall alignment that I think if they put two other stars on the floor at all times
*  could be resulting in like really high level baseline play all the time.
*  I'm excited to see it.
*  I'll be committed to watching them all season for the fun factor.
*  And again, because their style is so distinct,
*  even though I know that they will not do anything in the playoffs as constructed.
*  They may not even make it to be honest.
*  Right.
*  It's just the visceral feeling of watching these guys play so fast and be committed to that style.
*  Then like every single team every year says,
*  yeah, we're going to play with more space this year and like never does it.
*  But Sacramento is going to actually do it and deliver while playing absolutely no defense.
*  But I'm still here for it.
*  They might be the most entertaining team on the West Coast.
*  Right.
*  Incredibly.
*  They were entertaining last year.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And now the DeRosa thing makes it even better.
*  I feel like we can't lose with the Kings because if it doesn't go that well,
*  then it just becomes DeR and Fox trade machine time.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Because he didn't sign that extension, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's start making up trades with them.
*  Coke Presti on the phone.
*  Coke Presti is like, hello?
*  Hello?
*  What's the Scarface thing where they're like, ah!
*  Tony.
*  But I actually think they're going to go be more entertaining would be my pick for them.
*  I like their team.
*  I thought, you know, they won 48 and 46 the last two years.
*  I don't know why they would go backwards.
*  Also pretty fun arena and when it's close games, it gets pretty...
*  From a league pass standpoint, a lot of good stuff from that.
*  I like Light the Beam.
*  I like their fans.
*  Their games always have a good atmosphere.
*  Strong pick.
*  I'm taking the Celtics eight and...
*  This sucks.
*  You're picking your own team?
*  Well, they're really fun to watch.
*  They shoot a shitload of threes.
*  They have two of the best...
*  Can I tell you on behalf of our nation, who all love you and love your podcasting,
*  they're not that fun to watch.
*  They're fun to watch.
*  They have some of the best players in the league.
*  Show of hands.
*  Does anybody find the fucking Celtics fun to watch?
*  They're like in the middle of my rankings.
*  Okay.
*  Here's my question.
*  It's my pick.
*  Is there anything left to discover that we don't know?
*  So I'm going to make the case why they should be higher.
*  Oh, crazy. You had to ask this.
*  I think there's a chance.
*  My fingers crossed.
*  Sometimes when a team wins the title, the next year they come back
*  and they actually go up a level.
*  Like, and Steve Kerr has talked about this because I remember talking to him about this in my book.
*  There's a weird confidence that comes into play.
*  And I felt like they had that in that next game.
*  So I'm intrigued by how hard they go this season.
*  I think they're going to have a lot of blowout wins.
*  I think Tatum is really motivated.
*  Is a lot of blowout wins good for league pass?
*  Well, it's more for you.
*  Yeah, that's fair.
*  That's fair.
*  But it's interesting to watch these teams try to figure out.
*  They're just bouncing around the schedule.
*  Every team has these weaknesses and then they come in and the Celtics have 43s in the first half.
*  These teams, they almost don't know.
*  It's almost like in football when you play those teams that are just throwing it every down.
*  You're like, what's happening?
*  No other team plays like this.
*  I don't know.
*  There's a vibe.
*  I think the atmosphere is good.
*  I like the announcers.
*  And I don't know.
*  I just think they're really good to watch.
*  I'm more interested in them for non-basketball reasons.
*  I'm interested in them for Missoula post-game quotes.
*  Absolutely.
*  I'm interested in them for who's the worst person they could possibly be sold to who will bankrupt the team.
*  That is a conversation topic right now in Celtics Nation.
*  Six months are going to be on here defending sovereign wealth funds.
*  Yeah, you're like, look Abu Dhabi, you take the phone call.
*  You can't judge.
*  Shouts to MBS.
*  But no, I actually on our show yesterday, I think the Celtics could win 70 games this year.
*  I really do.
*  I think there's enough fuck you factor to Tatum with the Olympics, Brown with the Olympics,
*  Joe Missoula who nobody respects still even though he just won a championship.
*  I think legitimately these guys, you know this like nobody believed in us and nobody respects us.
*  Like Jordan just completely made it up out of thin air.
*  It wasn't true.
*  With the Celtics, it's true.
*  Yeah.
*  They've been legitimately disrespected especially on an individual level.
*  So I could see them chasing 70 wins or even trying to break the record.
*  And they got the talent, they got the continuity to do it.
*  I really do see them as like a 2016 Warriors type.
*  Yeah, if they hit that streak in the middle of the season where it's like the heat when they were on their run.
*  Or the rockets where it's like 18 regular season wins in a row.
*  We're locked in for 19.
*  We want to see if they can pull that kind of stuff off.
*  One thing I forgot to mention this is my league pass case.
*  They've mastered the regular season I think out of all the teams where they'll just rest one guy.
*  And then it'll be like Sam Houser, it's your night.
*  So this is cool.
*  Peyton Pritchard.
*  It's cool in the cell picture.
*  No, but they have an infrastructure where they fit these people in and they actually make sense in the game.
*  Versus like up and Beads playing.
*  Well there's no reason Ricky Council can't be getting blooded by Nick Nurse.
*  It's just all part of the plan.
*  But I like as a fan it's like oh it's going to be a Peyton Pritchard.
*  Let's cut him loose game.
*  Anyway, see how you're up.
*  For pure aesthetic reasons and we were talking a little bit about like everybody wants to push the ball.
*  Nobody pushes the ball like the Pacers.
*  So I'm going to go with them.
*  Matheran's back which is the kind of thing you say on a podcast.
*  But I actually love Benedict Matheran.
*  He brings a little bit of that crazy fuck you energy to the games.
*  Halliburton presumably does not have a hamstring injury right now.
*  And they're just a really exciting team.
*  Is he going to be good again or are we just that's never happening?
*  It comes Justin Verriert.
*  They just went to the conference finals.
*  Yeah but that was kind of like a fluky Blazers.
*  There's some flukes involved but he was still good.
*  Like their offense was still good.
*  And he's driving their offense.
*  So is he going to be good again though?
*  When we saw him at in season tournament like he was in he was MVP level right.
*  And that's when I was really like when I saw it in person I was like damn like that's when
*  I really joined the Halliburton train.
*  But ever since he came back from that injury he has not been that dude that was like
*  doing the Dame time to Milwaukee and like showing everybody up and just destroying people.
*  So I think but I think the level that he got in certain games against the Knicks is still
*  a high quality all-star level guy.
*  It just might not be every single night.
*  He hasn't been MVP level like he was very early on.
*  Yeah his first two months he was one of the four best guys in the league last year.
*  It was crazy.
*  Even yesterday.
*  So I was watching Mather and had a look in his eye like I'm here guys.
*  I was the missing piece last year.
*  He's a very confident player.
*  He really is.
*  I saw a video over the summer of him like dominating Carmelo's son and like talking
*  shit to him.
*  I was like this is the sicko stuff that I love is when NBA players like I'm not even
*  going to let you get like an Instagram reel off of me.
*  He's one of those guys who takes you know he takes the challenge.
*  Oh no it's Gilbert Arenas' kid.
*  He takes the challenge of being like really good seriously.
*  He dealt with a lot of nagging injuries last year but you know a lot of times these guys
*  we think in the second year is going to happen and then it doesn't and then you know ultimately
*  the third year becomes the year that they take that proverbial leap.
*  They also have so many young guys who's like is Mather going to pop?
*  Is Nem Hard going to take a step forward?
*  Is Jairus Walker going to give them anything?
*  Like I want to see what all those guys can do.
*  Or is Jairus Walker a bust?
*  What's going on with him?
*  Two other things with them.
*  They're a good opponent.
*  They bring out really fun games from the other team and I like their home court.
*  Like for League Pass it's just fun to watch games there where the fans seem really close
*  to the court.
*  It's like the only thing it's like the field house.
*  It's like almost like this throwback thing and so it also goes along with like McConnell
*  pressing guys for the entire full court.
*  It's like it's just they're fun games to watch.
*  Fun time out stuff too with them.
*  It's like Pacer fans let's honor Bob from Bob's Hardware Store.
*  Available for 60 years.
*  Selling the best hardware in Gary, Indiana.
*  Bill your Heartland voice is perfect.
*  Thank you.
*  Appreciate it.
*  All right you're up Wes.
*  I can't believe they've lasted this long.
*  It's Luka Doncic, the favorite to win the MVP of Dallas Mavericks.
*  I just I think Dallas is going back to the finals.
*  I think Luka's going to win the MVP.
*  I think they've constructed an even better roster.
*  Around him this year around the edges.
*  Klay Thompson is one thing.
*  Najee Marshall is another.
*  But I think also just going that far in the playoffs and learning what it takes to actually
*  win you know at that level.
*  I think Dallas is going to level up this season and you know I'm excited about Derek Lively.
*  I think I'm I'm over the moon for him in terms of his potential and I just you know and the
*  Kyrie thing of course is fun you know the twisty layups and the handle and all of that stuff.
*  Every single game but really it's Luka who you know I was joking to Rob the other day.
*  Like my first next LeBron was Giannis then it was Jokic.
*  Now it's Luka.
*  I really do think Luka is the next LeBron and is poised to like really make this thing happen.
*  I have nothing to add.
*  I think there are guys look there's some people I think are turned off by Luka's style.
*  Like how much he has the ball in his hands.
*  How much he creates.
*  I am turned off by Luka's style.
*  I can't I can't I can't connect with that.
*  I think in part for me it's like the longer his possessions go the more dramatic they feel.
*  Like his passes are so exceptional that I'm just like waiting to see how he gets himself out of the
*  straitjacket.
*  I think it's awesome the playoffs.
*  It's a little bit of a tough beat on a Tuesday night.
*  I hear you and that's where you hope that the Kyrie factor like the space they'll have with
*  Klay everything lively is going to be popping off this season.
*  That stuff will help.
*  It's a tough beat for PJ Washington year two now that he's it's not a new team anymore.
*  Yeah it's like six months I'm going to just be in the left corner.
*  Hoping hoping I get past.
*  So are you kind of like completely neutral on this team.
*  I don't know.
*  I listen I've talked about it before I don't love the heliocentric.
*  Yeah.
*  Harden to me is like my idea of hell to watch.
*  Like I didn't go last night.
*  Grant I was sick last night but I just I just don't want to drive 45 minutes to watch James
*  Harden have the ball for two hours straight.
*  It just sounds horrible.
*  Nothing against him.
*  Some people like it.
*  I just that's not what I like.
*  Nothing against him.
*  No I just don't like that stuff about basketball but Rob makes a good point.
*  Like other people see it as like this is amazing to watch this person
*  solve all these machinations off the same thing over and over again.
*  I just don't personally like.
*  They've made a lot of advances at the Intuit Dome.
*  It's like a new experience.
*  I would love it if James Harden got a notification every time you're coming.
*  So he's like 23 seconds at the top of the key.
*  The lunging into people.
*  Yeah I just.
*  Bill got up to go to the bathroom.
*  I could pass you.
*  Yeah.
*  Every time Bill goes to the bathroom Harden's like all right I'll sit now.
*  When he comes back let me know and I'll dribble for a while.
*  Who do you have?
*  This team would have been very high for me except for opening night.
*  I'm going to take the New York Knicks.
*  A lot to figure out.
*  I think the fact that they don't have a bench makes them a better regular season team in some ways.
*  Like I'm not going to get a lot of bad minutes from guys who can't play.
*  Like I think we're going to find out pretty quickly if like
*  Daddy A can be literally anything for them.
*  If campaign can be literally anything for them.
*  But Jalen Brunson has to play.
*  Well Jalen Brunson has to play huge minutes.
*  Like their best players have to play huge minutes every night.
*  And so it's almost the Knicks are the opposite of the Sixers problem.
*  Where their best guys are going to be out there.
*  Like they're going to run themselves into the ground to try to get this thing through.
*  And I want to be there to watch it.
*  And I want to see if they can solve some of the clutter that they had on opening night for sure.
*  I agree with that.
*  I want to watch just to watch McHale British shoot.
*  It's like it really should be a sixer with that shot.
*  His last three was good though.
*  Okay.
*  That's something that looks smooth.
*  It was looking pretty gamey for the last couple of weeks.
*  Wise, what are you saying on Bodega Cat?
*  Look, my thing is the same.
*  I like that he's the seventh most important voice in the room.
*  That he's coming into a situation where like
*  nobody's ever called you the savior of the Knicks.
*  You've never been the golden boy here.
*  You're coming here and people are looking at you like you got to assimilate to this culture.
*  I love that aspect of it.
*  He's not being asked to lead anybody because let's face it, he couldn't do that.
*  But I think he's old enough and I don't want to say wise enough.
*  But I think he'll get the hint that he has to conform to what they're trying to do.
*  And I would hope that it's impressed upon him the
*  sort of magnitude of what they're trying to accomplish there.
*  What it would mean to the people in New York, the fans of that team,
*  for them to actually live up to their expectations.
*  Jalen Brunson so obviously gets it.
*  Truly gets it, what this Nick thing is.
*  I just hope that Carl Towns gets to that point.
*  I think if he does, he's going to learn how to be additive to what they're doing.
*  I don't think he's going to be Will Chamberlain or anything stupid like that.
*  But I think he can be very complimentary to Jalen Brunson.
*  What he's trying to do in the in-between game.
*  And I think he could be obviously way better than Julius Randall.
*  So yeah, that's where I'm at with Cat.
*  I thought Brunson looked pretty good in the first game,
*  considering he was still covered in Dante G. Fuenzo's blood.
*  After the ruthless trading of his college buddy.
*  My god, would I ever trade Joe House?
*  It's like, sorry, House.
*  If we had a chance to get so and so, you're now working over there.
*  Sorry, buddy.
*  We're still going to hang out, right?
*  It's so awesome.
*  It was fucked up.
*  Can you imagine if I was just screaming at Sarutti like,
*  this is what happens when they let you run things, Sarutti.
*  We have to talk about the magic before the Sixers.
*  Well, this draft has been too predictable and I'm about to uproot it.
*  And it's genuine too because I love this team and I almost picked them four picks ago.
*  They were on the big screen last night for me.
*  There's a lot to love, the Atlanta Hawks.
*  I have their over, 36 and a half.
*  I like watching them.
*  Trey is just like, thank God DeJontay Murray's not here anymore.
*  Yeah, the vibe change was crazy.
*  Incredible vibe change.
*  Lobs galore.
*  Multiple 6'9", 6'10".
*  Skinny guy.
*  You have to really look.
*  You can almost not tell them apart.
*  I'm still getting used to like, oh, is that?
*  No, that's Johnson.
*  They all like, it's just like interchangeable length and weirdness.
*  I'll be honest, man.
*  Waz, we haven't talked about this.
*  I have property on Richochet Island.
*  Oh, man.
*  I'm fucking in on Richochet.
*  Like, I'm legit in on him.
*  I like that guy.
*  You know Chateau?
*  I liked him in the preseason.
*  Listen, it was not expensive.
*  Yeah, is there a vineyard attached?
*  Expectations were down.
*  I like that guy.
*  I like how even his boxcore last night didn't really show what he was doing.
*  Can I read you the ESPN headline here?
*  What is it?
*  As number one pick, Richochet opens with three, goes two for eight.
*  That's it.
*  Mr. Lamp in traffic.
*  That's clickbait right there.
*  I thought he was good.
*  I think he hustles.
*  And he makes sense to me as somebody who will be a valuable person on a really good NBA team.
*  And they have him and they have Dyson Daniels and they have Johnson.
*  They're just weird.
*  They're fun to play.
*  They have two big guys.
*  The Kongu came in.
*  Bogdanovic comes in and just takes over the offense for six.
*  I think they're pretty good.
*  I gotta say.
*  It's a good question when you say you know you have Lee pass when dot dot dot.
*  Dyson Daniels is trending on your for you.
*  Whereas Dyson Daniels is locking guys up.
*  Alcatraz, let's go.
*  Well, last night he was almost murdered in real time by Nick Claxton.
*  Nick Claxton was trying to get suspended for the season so he doesn't have to play with
*  Cam Thomas anymore.
*  Who can blame him?
*  Yeah.
*  He was like, this is my one shot to get out of here.
*  That game was super fun.
*  There was almost two fights.
*  It got super feisty.
*  It was close to the end.
*  Atlanta's also not good enough to close games, which is great for league pass.
*  They're up by eight with a minute left somehow.
*  Brooklyn had a chance at the end.
*  Thumbs up.
*  That team seems like a 43 win team to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a Jalen Johnson believer.
*  I really love his package of both physical gifts but he has a nose for the game.
*  He has genuine feel.
*  He's not just like out there some robotic athletic guy.
*  I like that.
*  I think like you guys said, the De'Jante Murray thing was a clarifying trade.
*  The team now has an obvious focal point and it's more organized instead of the sort of
*  your turn, my turn nature that they were doing last year.
*  For league pass purposes, Trey Young is going to get on people's nerves and that's always fun.
*  He's going to make a point of it.
*  Plus, he went to Istanbul, y'all.
*  I see the new beard.
*  We know what's going on with that.
*  So we can't put that past.
*  You can tie in soccer coach.
*  He was like, give me the Antonio Conte.
*  Come on now.
*  You had me at, they could be fun to watch.
*  You lost me at 43 wins.
*  This team is not winning that many games.
*  That would be like six over the over under.
*  I think they can get to like 43 and 39 because it looks like Miami might be worse than we thought.
*  Or they got Magic.
*  I thought you were Butler.
*  They got a case of the Paolos over there.
*  Did you see all those sucky Eastern Conference teams yesterday?
*  It's brutal.
*  Somebody is going to have to win 43 games that we don't.
*  Could it be Charlotte?
*  I don't know.
*  I think the Hawks are like way better than Washington and Chicago.
*  They're way better than that group.
*  But I don't know that they're that close to the Miamis and the Indies.
*  I think there's a level below that somebody's going to be in.
*  It's either them or Miami.
*  You could step on Rakes all season and make the East play in.
*  So I'm not ruling out they could be there.
*  There's going to be a Bulls-Hawks kind of like race to the bottom there.
*  I kind of like their team.
*  If Rhysachet turns out to be good right away, which I think there's a chance he's a little bit impactful.
*  I don't know.
*  Watch out for them.
*  All right, CR, we got to move faster.
*  Okay, I'm going to go with the Rockets.
*  There's very few teams who market themselves as tough.
*  So it's kind of fun to watch them on any given night get into people's shit.
*  It's more of a preseason thing, but the Reed Shepard experience so far has been delightful.
*  You didn't get as much of a look last night, but Sangoon did and basically did baby Jokic all night.
*  And I still have and they lost and they lost.
*  I know, which is kind of the fun part is because there isn't like the Boston thing where you're
*  like, can you win 70 though?
*  It's like, no, are these guys going to actually pick a rotation, pick an identity, pick a like
*  a sort of hierarchy and are they going to play tough every night?
*  Which I think they will.
*  This is very foreign for me because I usually traditionally do not like the Rockets,
*  but this is a collection of guys that I like and a collection of guys that I hate watch.
*  I hated them.
*  I'm in violent agreement with you.
*  I watched a lot of them last night.
*  Same thing.
*  And I don't think they have any idea what their rotation is.
*  No, they played their top five a lot.
*  Whitmore barely played.
*  But he played, which I thought was a plus.
*  Right.
*  So they tried to play 10 and then Shepard, it's just, he just seemed tiny to me.
*  Yeah.
*  Like people were talking about him coming in.
*  They got smoked as soon as he came in.
*  I'm still a re-Shepard guy.
*  No, I'm in too, but it was like, oh, this guy's a little bit.
*  I think once it slows down a little bit, but like the preseason, it was like, is this Pete
*  Maravich?
*  And now it's like, oh, this guy's little.
*  Like they're going to hunt him on defense.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, in the holy war that is developing, Chris, do you identify more as a Shangoon guy
*  or a Jalen Green guy?
*  I think I really way preferred watching them on that run they went in after Shangoon, but
*  they are aesthetically way more pleasing to watch with Shangoon.
*  Isn't the question, are you a Shangoon guy or a Jabari Smith guy?
*  A little bit.
*  Because that seems to be the fundamental.
*  Like Jabari was invisible last night.
*  And I thought what made them special was him as the stretch five in that kind of pseudo
*  towns role.
*  Yeah.
*  That was, and then that opened up the paint.
*  If he's not playing five, he has to like apply some basketball like feel.
*  And that's not what he does.
*  Where do you think Miami is going to play him when they trade for Jimmy Butler?
*  This is the thing is that I feel like Houston, even though they haven't really proved anything,
*  are almost at a point where they have to do some subtraction.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like they have too many guys.
*  I did this in part one of the pod.
*  I think that I think it's a three for one trade team and I don't know what the trade was.
*  Like it could it be Jimmy Butler?
*  Could it be somebody on that level where they just kind of cash in?
*  Because I think they have too many guys.
*  They have like six players who could have could deservingly play 10 more minutes a game
*  than they will probably.
*  Well, and also Thompson seems like he might actually be special.
*  He's really, he looks really good.
*  He's almost like I can't keep him up the court guy.
*  So I don't know what that means either.
*  He's maybe the biggest quirk in the Shangoon part of that because like playing Jabari at
*  the five is the clearest way to make Ahmed Thompson really, really good, really, really
*  quickly or at least give him lots of opportunities.
*  And maybe it's like a first line, second line thing where the second unit is the time where
*  he gets to cook.
*  Like I floated this in part one.
*  Brooks Adams expiring and Thompson for Jimmy Butler is like a really interesting who says
*  no and I don't know if I would do that if I was Houston.
*  I think I would rather.
*  Because I don't think that guarantees me round three.
*  What's the point of that?
*  Well, I think we're in the same phase we've been in the whole time.
*  Of the team.
*  So yeah.
*  All right.
*  What do you got, Was?
*  Man, this is tough.
*  It's not that tough actually.
*  It's the Los Angeles Lakers for me.
*  And the tier that I put them in is like, you know, Steph, KD, LeBron.
*  Like it's like your favorite bar just announced that they're about to close in a few weeks.
*  So you go for a few last time.
*  You go a couple more times.
*  For all time.
*  Yeah.
*  I got to steal a glass.
*  That's why I'm tuning into the Lakers.
*  Like LeBron is 40 years old, right?
*  So like for that reason alone and then Quad has kept the Lakers have been one of the most
*  hilarious teams to watch in the league for like two and a half years now.
*  Like a bunch of blown leads like dissing the coach for no reason.
*  Both Vogel and Darvin Ham.
*  Even though we lose that element with JJ, the players won't be sniping at him,
*  but the JJ media interactions are going to be entertaining.
*  Would you see his first in-coach interview, in-game coach interview?
*  I do not.
*  He gave like a minute and a half long answer.
*  It's like, JJ, one sentence is out.
*  JJ's like, here are the four things I thought went well in the first three quarters.
*  Then he did the post-game thing where he was like, he had just gotten out of the shower
*  and he was like, I'm writing a letter to the league requesting that we use worn basketballs.
*  I was like, you gotta fucking take it easy, man.
*  I gotta say, I was...
*  It was a long year.
*  Great, we're watching on TV.
*  I was pretty impressed by him.
*  I mean, their team was really good.
*  He seemed locked in.
*  He was locked in on the refs.
*  They ran good plays out of timeouts.
*  I thought he handled the Bronny thing as well as you could have possibly handled that situation.
*  They did a really good job just being like, we're doing this, we're getting it out of the way.
*  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of the way.
*  There's not gonna be any LeBron watch.
*  They really ran through Davis.
*  Like, they weren't beholden to, all right, LeBron, it's here of all time.
*  And they're using Connect in the right ways.
*  I thought he did a good job.
*  We also, with League Pass standpoint, you get the celebrities and the shots during the timeouts.
*  You get a taste of how fucking weird LA is every time out.
*  Do they count as a League Pass team if they're gonna be on national TV every day?
*  It's an interesting...
*  Well, it's a soap opera because they're gonna lose three in a row.
*  The first passive aggressive, D'Angelo Russell.
*  He's available.
*  That's gonna happen.
*  First time LeBron's like, I just work here.
*  I don't know why I only took eight shots.
*  You have to ask JJ.
*  So we'll have all the roller coaster ride of that stuff.
*  I love that stuff.
*  Who do you have, my honey?
*  Easy one for you, Memphis Grizzlies.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Yeah, this is X for me.
*  Love watching Jon Maran play basketball.
*  I'm a simple man, simple pleasures.
*  He does incredible shit.
*  Down the stretch last night was nice.
*  The up and unders, the dunk attempts, the way to intercept steals out of midair.
*  Who the fuck was the white guy?
*  Which guy?
*  Huff.
*  Where'd he come from?
*  Cover basketball for a living.
*  I was like, who's this?
*  And he was on two teams the last two years but never really played.
*  Well, I know Wasp.
*  He was in crunch time.
*  Huge Santi Aldama game, too.
*  I know we're locked in on that, Wasp, of course.
*  Yes, we.
*  Yeah.
*  Huff, you could have told me 30 countries and I would have believed any of them.
*  But I think he's from here.
*  Yeah, I'm with the job parts.
*  Fun to see how it's going to play out, whether he can get to where he needs to go.
*  Scottie Piven Jr. 22 minutes last night.
*  He's legit.
*  I think he's a legit back player.
*  Yeah, I think he's legit.
*  He's a legit guy.
*  I really like a lot of their players and especially once Gigi Jackson and Vince Williams get back.
*  There's just like a lot of them.
*  Probably going to have a little bit less Jay Huff, though.
*  Yeah, that's going to be a tough blow for Bill.
*  I wish he didn't have a first name.
*  I just think he should go Huff.
*  He should get himself a jersey.
*  A Huff jersey.
*  Huff.
*  Marcus Smart looked a little doughy to me.
*  Just going to mention that.
*  That's wild.
*  I don't know if it's age or what.
*  They were playing 13 guys.
*  So he looked a little swole.
*  Yeah.
*  Is Marcus Smart not going to be in the Celtics ring of honor?
*  Oh yeah, you guys are not going to retire his number?
*  No.
*  You guys are going to...
*  Is he going to get like...
*  We all have a lot of affection for Marcus.
*  I just thought he looked big.
*  Like he put on like weight.
*  I'm not saying he looked fat.
*  I'm saying he looked like...
*  Try celebrating that Celtics title.
*  Muscle.
*  Also Memphis barbecue not to be trifled with.
*  Let's all be honest about it.
*  I would like him a little leaner.
*  I'll make this quick.
*  I'm taking Denver because of Jokic.
*  Yeah.
*  That's easy.
*  We don't need to discuss them.
*  Although it is fun to watch whatever the hell is going to happen with their bench and see if they can figure out whether they can find eight guys who can play consistently.
*  But Jokic...
*  This will make me mad this year that his team around him isn't better.
*  Because you have this incredible asset.
*  And he has no bench.
*  And they were trying to do the thing where they were much smarter than everybody.
*  And we're going young in length.
*  And it's like...
*  You know what helps?
*  Some fucking players that could come in and play well for 15 minutes.
*  Can you just find a couple of those?
*  The thing about Jokic too...
*  He doesn't strike me as a guy who's like reading the press clippings and is like...
*  Oh Denver's going to stink this year.
*  He doesn't care.
*  He's just going to go out and do what he does.
*  He's like...
*  People write about this?
*  You guys like this?
*  Yeah.
*  I just have a bad feeling we may get to the point in January where it's like the Faku Kampatsu Nuggets vibes.
*  It's like...
*  Why is this guy out there?
*  Why is this guy in the rotation?
*  The Michael Malone performance art of refusing to play anybody under the age of 26.
*  Julien Strother, Hunter Tyson...
*  Let one of these guys play.
*  Yeah it could be like an amazing Jokic here where he's just like...
*  Alright get on my back everybody.
*  I'm just going to make chicken salad out of chicken shit again.
*  CR you're up.
*  I'm going to go Pelicans aka Philadelphia South.
*  Dejante...
*  I think he had 10 assists before he fractured his hand last night.
*  Zion Williamson out for...
*  These guys probably should have gone higher.
*  Bill Simmons flew but as far as like watching on League Pass goes Zion still is one of the top five reasons to watch basketball when he's on and when he's playing.
*  It's just so fucking fun and interesting.
*  They have fun bench guys too.
*  I like Messi.
*  Yep.
*  I like Hawkins.
*  Yeah.
*  Trey Murphy obviously.
*  Is really good and yeah I think when Murray comes back...
*  The fact that they don't have a center might be an issue at some point this season.
*  Seems like it could yeah.
*  But I love how like freestyle it can be and Willie Grier can throw all these different combinations and if you get Zion out there it's worth watching alone.
*  Plus we're on Brandon Ingram watch.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah it was good last time.
*  Entering year six of it.
*  Yeah.
*  No questions.
*  Obviously he wants a new deal.
*  Good luck.
*  He was so clearly on the trade block this entire summer.
*  Well last year too.
*  But yeah I'm interested to see how he responds to that.
*  Could that be a Coke Presti phone call?
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  Don't do it.
*  He's too ball stopper.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he's more of somebody's had a chance to compete at a really high level and their best player got hurt or their best scorer got hurt or...
*  Or like Sacramento's.
*  Yeah.
*  We're desperate now.
*  Let's do something.
*  Why would you get Brandon Ingram when you have Demar at home is my problem.
*  From a lead pass standpoint I just want to point out the New Orleans is kind of a bummer sometimes.
*  Yes sometimes there's 14 people.
*  The crowds are awful sometimes where you're just like Jesus Christ guys like Minnesota's in town.
*  Yeah.
*  Jose Alvarado is a guy that's a soft spot.
*  Christ the King guy.
*  Puerto Rican guy.
*  If you grew up in New York City you know him.
*  You absolutely know Jose Alvarado.
*  And so you know love that guy Ruth.
*  What I love about the Pelicans is we're talking about all these other teams in the sense that like we're all going to watch the same version of the Sixers whether they're healthy or not.
*  When you watch the Pelicans there's like your version of that team within them the five guys that you like playing together.
*  They may not actually get that much time on the floor as one unit but everyone has their version of that roster that they like.
*  It's just a matter of who's whether they get enough run or not.
*  This is another team that feels like it's not going to be the same team in February.
*  Like something will be different.
*  Something will have gone very wrong if it is.
*  All right we're going to take one more break and then now we're entering the most exciting part of the podcast.
*  There's only seven rounds and two teams will not get drafted.
*  Who are the two teams that are going to live in ignominy not getting drafted in the league pass draft that's coming up next.
*  All right come back Rob Mahoney is up.
*  I feel like we're in a very simple part of the ranking now in the draft.
*  I'm taking the Milwaukee Bucks.
*  They have Giannis on their team.
*  I will watch him play every game that he can play.
*  Watch him run through the wall every time he wants to run through the wall.
*  I know they have their issues as a contender but as a regular season product Dame and Giannis is pretty great where I stand.
*  Dame with a summer workout regimen too.
*  Can Dame go from being once a week to twice a week as having good games.
*  Which is if he does they're going to be fun to watch.
*  He started off slow and there was little grumblings in the room that we were watching and like can you believe they gave up true holiday for this.
*  And then he's drained like four threes in a row from 30 feet away.
*  It's like oh yeah that's why they traded.
*  Those were also those were partisan gripes that were being made.
*  Yeah we know.
*  Those were partisan gripes.
*  We don't need to do too much on Milwaukee but the doc the doc coach interviews are always fun too.
*  Yeah.
*  Doc what happened out there.
*  Oh you told me we were terrible.
*  Not sure.
*  We're apparently we're not playing defense tonight.
*  He just doesn't give a shit anymore.
*  So I'm up then.
*  Yeah who do you think.
*  All right I got it right.
*  I just got to keep track of this.
*  Okay.
*  Oh man I really want to.
*  Do I want to throw the draft out of whack again.
*  No I'll take Phoenix.
*  Guess what Kevin Durant still really fun to watch.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought it was interesting that they still don't seem like they have chemistry yet.
*  A little rough on that then so far.
*  Last night Booker was the one that suffered but it seems like they can't get all the guys
*  going at the same time but I like seeing Coach Budd who just seems like he
*  was on a ozempic or Atkins or something.
*  The Arizona Sun was really getting them.
*  But yeah Phoenix for me.
*  Yeah I hope that I hope that Coach Budd could get them to be more elastic in their games man.
*  Like KD Bradley Bill it just so used to playing one way.
*  Like I hope he could coax some elasticity out of him but you know yeah it's still KD
*  when he's just like dribbling people at mid range and just training it.
*  Super fun.
*  From my next pick I'm gonna go Steph and the Dirty Dozen.
*  Yeah.
*  Just gotta watch Steph while he's still here.
*  It's just crazy that we get this far in the grass.
*  Wow you sound like you're talking to grandpa.
*  Well no.
*  We gotta go visit grandpa while he's still here.
*  I honestly weirdly feel like the extended Twilight of LeBron has overshadowed this
*  is probably also the Twilight of Steph.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Or has it because I feel like Steph can play until he's like 48.
*  But like literally no guard has ever done this before.
*  Yeah.
*  No one his size has ever played this well this late.
*  So they were I mean I think they had the Blazers last night that was pretty quick.
*  And they played like 14 guys but it's a weird.
*  Would you see what Kerr said?
*  What?
*  I mean he literally did a 12 man rotation and talked about it after.
*  He's like I just wanted to see if we could figure this out.
*  I mean how did you feel about that as someone who watched Jason Cain be exercised?
*  It's an absolute violation.
*  Yeah especially at the Olympics but no I just don't think
*  I think you play 12 guys during a season but during an actual game it makes no sense.
*  You've played basketball.
*  Occasionally yeah.
*  Because you're just not playing enough.
*  It's stupid.
*  I don't get it.
*  As an experiment I think it's interesting.
*  But yeah I'll go with well I'll go with Warriors and you know no play.
*  I think Curry has to be he can't be in the bottom 10 of a draft.
*  No.
*  No.
*  My team is Charlotte.
*  God damn it.
*  That was the one I almost took two spots ago.
*  Yeah Charlotte and you know Brandon Miller I feel very heavily invested in.
*  I watched him play two games in the SEC tournament.
*  There you go.
*  He declared him the rightful number two pick in the draft.
*  Seed investor.
*  And I've just been holding on ever since when I put my scout hat on.
*  But no like I just really love his you know his like fake Paul George routine that he's doing.
*  Especially early on in his career.
*  Aspirational Paul George routine.
*  Okay aspirational.
*  Oh I like that.
*  See that's how you get paid big bucks Rob Mahoney.
*  And then of course LaMelo ball man like he dropped 34 last night.
*  I think it's you know everything has come sort of like as a given right.
*  Like they gave him that big extension just automatically just as a given.
*  I think it's now finally time for him to actually put this stuff on tape and show like why he.
*  You think so year five maybe it's time.
*  I think so yeah.
*  I think I thought he was awesome last night.
*  I watched that whole game that was one of the three TVs and that team.
*  So Verno talked about this on the mismatch.
*  He sat next to the bench.
*  This is the Celtics love Charles Lee and this was I thought the hardest over under for me.
*  Because it's 29.
*  I really like the over.
*  I also don't know what incentive they have to be like we made the play in.
*  But you watch them last night and it's just they're a good team.
*  Like I mean a good bad team.
*  But they had you know they have Curry they have Grant Williams the Miles Bridges.
*  They have rebounding and LaMelo was awesome.
*  And then out of nowhere Trey Mann.
*  I know he can hoop.
*  If they can say mildly healthy.
*  That's the thing.
*  I think it's going to be.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think the team I watched last night was well coached.
*  They had a specific style.
*  They had an identity.
*  They were tough.
*  They were like walking around with their chests out and I was like oh this is.
*  I might have bet on them too.
*  So I'm enjoying that part.
*  But I think I think for the first month they're a team to kind of watch as a frisky dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my god Charlotte beat Cleveland in Cleveland last night.
*  I think I do think they might be one of those teams.
*  They're not as good as the Pacers but they play a similar up tempo style.
*  LaMelo has a similar kinetic energy to him that's really watchable.
*  And when he's healthy they win a lot of games.
*  So I hope he can be healthy.
*  And he puts up big stats.
*  Puts up big stats.
*  Fun to watch in like a no no no yes kind of way.
*  Like the step backs.
*  The killer he shot he took like a 30 footer to close the game yesterday.
*  There you go.
*  That's what you need on a league pass like Thursday like Tuesday night I guess I should say.
*  I thought that I thought that team and we haven't talked about Detroit yet but same thing where.
*  They just seem like they weren't rudderless anymore.
*  Detroit seemed more professional.
*  It wasn't Monty Williams benching change.
*  No it's like what's going on here.
*  It's like all right they have Malik Beasley but at least he's an adult.
*  Yeah.
*  You know anyway all right what do you have Rob?
*  This is where I feel like there's a chasm.
*  Like Charlotte was kind of the the embankment for me.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a drop.
*  I am going to take the Pistons here.
*  I just I want it to be true so bad.
*  I want them to be fun and watchable.
*  I'm not even hoping for good yet.
*  Can they be an entertaining basketball product because they have a really exciting playmaker
*  in Cade Cunningham.
*  They have in theory better spacing.
*  I don't know that those guys will actually hit shots like I see a lot of like one for seven.
*  They're going to take them.
*  They will take them.
*  Especially Tim Hardaway Jr.
*  And that's the thing like is Tobias Harris enough of a shooter that people will kind
*  of guard him in ways that they wouldn't guard Pistons of Seasons past.
*  And if so I think the Pistons are going to be at least watchable.
*  He's a better shooter than the Beef Stew.
*  I thought they were watchable last night.
*  I mean it seems like we cannot possibly overestimate how bad Monty was for that team.
*  How bad the Monty Williams experience was.
*  I mean Jay Nivy was one of my favorite guys coming out of college that year.
*  So it's really exciting to see him score 17.
*  It's almost like you shouldn't beg a guy to coach your team or GM your team like the Knicks
*  did Phil Jackson.
*  He was supposed to professionalize them and for all their flaws last night they still
*  couldn't close it.
*  They did look more professional.
*  Yes new hair for Cade.
*  He's like I'm a new man new team.
*  I took note of that.
*  In the Trey Young sense of New Hair.
*  I like new hair.
*  I took Beef Stew was out there.
*  Always enjoyed him.
*  Yeah they're interesting.
*  It's either going to be Charlotte or Detroit for that 10th play in spot.
*  And we'll see who gives a shit more about the season.
*  Wow this is getting dark.
*  Man I really want to take Brooklyn here but I'm not going to.
*  I know that's stupid.
*  Why would you want to?
*  There's no way.
*  What is the urge you're feeling to take Brooklyn?
*  Maybe I'll take them with my last pick.
*  So Utah I have no they have to be the next pick.
*  I have no idea what they want to be.
*  I assume they don't want to win and they're just stockpiling picks.
*  But you watched them last night especially when in crunch time and it's like
*  these guys are pretty good.
*  Like they're well coached.
*  They have a score at the end of games.
*  They have rim protection.
*  They have guards that can go by people.
*  They seem like they're trying on defense and they're just going to be a lot of fun West Coast games.
*  So I feel like I'm not going to I won't get fooled again with the Jazz because I know
*  what's going to happen which is at the trade deadline or right after 22 and 21 record to start.
*  And just going to come make the phone call and it's like look we need to get in the
*  Cooper flag business.
*  Stop fucking winning these games.
*  Well the guy to trade is Kessler then if they're going to do that because he's that well just like
*  you want to start weakening your team with like let's get rid of our shop walking.
*  Or they're not going to trade marketing they're not allowed to.
*  Or you can continue to empower Kian Te George to take 18 shots and Colin Sexton to take eight.
*  That's one way to ensure that you get the number one pick.
*  They do have two like the 12 guys you probably wouldn't want to play with if you were like a swing man.
*  I think I think I like Colin Sexton.
*  Sexton's a guy that contenders should call about.
*  He's not as he's not as ball hoggy as he used to be when Kev Love was like beaming him in the
*  back of the head.
*  Honestly I think he's been a boy scout over there.
*  I think he's really turned his career around.
*  And I want to say I hope by the deadline that he's able to go to a contender that needs like
*  some scoring pops and ball handling.
*  But he's a six man.
*  Yeah yeah yeah that's what he's not a.
*  Or the point guard on a team that has like like we were talking about him for the magic like
*  wing playmaking that needs maybe an alternative look at a scoring guard like he could make sense
*  for a team like that.
*  Well I don't know if you noticed during the Nets game Dennis Schroeder was actually wearing an
*  Orlando Magic jersey with a Brooklyn logo taped over it just praying for them to trade for him.
*  All right CR I think this is it.
*  We only have six teams left.
*  Oh OK.
*  This is our last round.
*  So I can't wait to see who doesn't get drafted.
*  All right this is in the spirit of 2012 era real heads kind of league pass like possibly
*  stoned watching on your couch looking for almost abstract art in your basketball.
*  So I'm going to pick the Blazers.
*  Because is is scoot high on his couch watching abstract art while he's playing.
*  Who are these guys is Denny for real.
*  Like how many centers do they have is Klingon going to be like what he was in the preseason.
*  Also they might go oh and 15 to start the season.
*  Yeah how many player pods is Chauncey Billups going to do where he's like just being like
*  I hate all these guys.
*  So I'm excited for the Blazers experience and it's like often the last game ending.
*  On the West Coast.
*  It's so it's kind of fun to just be like yeah it's just me and seven other dudes watching
*  this Blazers Kings game.
*  Chauncey's agents like yo if you can get out of your contract right now NBC and Amazon
*  are looking for guys.
*  You got to get out now.
*  So I'd play scoot 48 minutes a game and just tell them to clear out.
*  I'm a big Anthony Simon's guy so I'll always enjoy those minutes particularly on this team
*  dominating just being happy to be wildly overpaid.
*  Yeah I think you have to pick one complete team and it's yeah I have a different team
*  but Simon's I think is another fun contender piece.
*  Yeah I'd like to see him on Orlando.
*  I don't know if they need somebody like that.
*  A year and a half now.
*  All right.
*  Well we disrespected this team by not picking them.
*  I'm picking a Miami Heat.
*  Come on man Jimmy Butler is BAM Jaime Hot Caz you know.
*  You feel like this is like season 11 of this show.
*  Yeah it's like Virgin River still on.
*  It's Gray's Anatomy at this point.
*  I get it but I'm going to watch them when they're on right.
*  Especially over the teams that are left on this list.
*  So yeah Miami you know they're going to be well coached if not very fun.
*  And yeah I can't in good conscience pick any of these other teams left.
*  That's the thing the alternatives are very very bleak.
*  So thank you for that.
*  I appreciate it was.
*  It's fair and they'll get going at some point but I probably my least favorite stadium announcer
*  timeout situation of the crowd.
*  People showing up at 825.
*  I was about to do an impression of you playing by fleek.
*  I don't know.
*  You know what you don't pop that off.
*  No.
*  The heat culture like the it's like an infomercial.
*  It's not a very fun experience.
*  It's fun to have them on a small TV with no sound.
*  Rob who do you have?
*  I feel terrible about all these teams.
*  I will take by default the Toronto Raptors.
*  Oh interesting.
*  The RJ Barrett Renaissance is upon us my friends.
*  I'm eager for him to get back back in the mix.
*  I think it's like week to week right now which is not what you want to hear coming into the season.
*  But I identify as an Emmanuel quickly guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I love watching him with a little more room to work.
*  I think we're all eager to see what Scotty Barnes can become.
*  Are you one of those hipsters who think Scotty Barnes is like the prototypical NBA player?
*  I'm not.
*  But I'm invested.
*  I'm invested in the greater project.
*  Got you.
*  I don't want to watch them at all.
*  So this is the Mr. Irrelevant pick you've got here.
*  You're telling me you would take Brooklyn over this.
*  Here's the thing.
*  I fucked up.
*  We skipped a Waz pick.
*  I'm going to blame the fact that I'm still on cold medication.
*  We skipped a Waz pick.
*  CR took New Orleans.
*  It skipped to Rob who took Milwaukee and I took Phoenix.
*  Oof.
*  So Waz, I'm sorry.
*  I have to pick another team?
*  You have to take another team.
*  Come on, man.
*  Take the wisdom.
*  Are we sure we don't want to make fun of Toronto for another second?
*  Because did Masai U-Hare, like he won the title and he got another job?
*  What's he doing?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  But I think he got equity in the team.
*  So why is he then trying to take them?
*  Equity in the team means you put together a bad team?
*  I will say.
*  Make them a less valuable property?
*  That's a great question.
*  That is like a brutal team to watch.
*  Didn't Yaka Poodle say it's not like we're trying to win every game?
*  Like it was not like his quote.
*  I had them in my bottom too.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  I think you really underestimate the Wizards.
*  I cue R.J. Barrett, Scotty Barnes.
*  I just don't like watching that team.
*  That can be fun to watch.
*  Well, you get to watch them and be like this is basically like what it was like watching the Knicks five years ago.
*  Yeah, that's what it is.
*  I want to see the R.J. thing get like where it goes.
*  I want to watch where that story goes to go from the guy that got picked directly behind Ja and Zion and what those guys have become bonafide all-stars when Zion plays.
*  Well, Ja too.
*  To like R.J. who's just like, yeah, you know, he was so disappointed in that.
*  Counter.
*  Not that interested.
*  Wizards, there's four teams left.
*  Chicago, Brooklyn, the Clippers, and Washington.
*  Listen.
*  Those are our big four.
*  I'm picking Chicago and it's for Kobe White alone.
*  He's one of my favorite guys to watch in the NBA.
*  His elevation of his game from like just this volume sort of shooter guy to like legitimate ball handle, turn the corner on guys, firing up pull up threes.
*  He's one of the most fun guys to watch.
*  And so I'll be watching for that alone.
*  I don't care about, you know, the freaking Josh Giddy thing.
*  I think he stinks.
*  Yeah, but if Giddy and Lonzo are both playing, you could have like a pretty fun.
*  Lonzo thinks fun.
*  I feel like we shorted them a little bit unfairly.
*  I don't know.
*  You guys think this team is going to be fun to watch?
*  Also for the past, Stacey King is a pretty fun announcer to watch.
*  Yes.
*  Or listen to.
*  He is fun.
*  So it's good.
*  Well, I was hoping they'd still be there.
*  Pick 28.
*  Do it.
*  And they are.
*  Do it.
*  The Brooklyn Nets.
*  How many Justin can Thomas take?
*  I was absolutely riveted by them last night.
*  Ben Simmons, who actually looked pretty good.
*  I did something on part one about it.
*  I think, you know, there's a little showcasing.
*  Nick Claxton was like, I got paid.
*  I also don't want to be here anymore.
*  Maybe if I maybe I can get ejected right away.
*  The Cam Thomas thing is the funniest league pass subplot of the season.
*  Why is this?
*  Why do they let him?
*  This is like the NBA I grew up with in the late 70s where guys were like,
*  I'm coming in and I'm shooting every time.
*  I'm shooting every time.
*  He might actually lead the league in scoring this year if Lucas decides not to score less.
*  There were fan dual odds on him.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  He might score 30 points a game.
*  He will not score.
*  He shoots all the time.
*  Who's idea was this?
*  Nobody else shoots in this team.
*  Cam Thomas's idea.
*  I can assure you.
*  Why is this happening?
*  He could literally lead the league in scoring and not make the All-Star team.
*  There's zero chance he makes the All-Star team.
*  Oh, not only will he not make the All-Star team.
*  They might just have to send him home so other guys can shoot.
*  This is basically like why, like how many nets have just been like,
*  please get me out of here because of this.
*  Nobody wants to be there.
*  So Rob scoffed.
*  Yes.
*  I can't even feign enthusiasm for this team.
*  I can't.
*  No, you scoffed at the Cam Thomas scoring title?
*  Yes.
*  Right now he has the seventh highest odds on fan dual out of all the players in the NBA.
*  I feel legally obligated to inform everyone listening to this podcast.
*  Do not make that bet.
*  Are you sure though?
*  I'm so sure.
*  Lucas the favorite plus 145 and Beads plus 390.
*  He's not going to play 55.
*  He won't qualify.
*  Shay, Giannis, Brunson, Edwards and Cam Thomas.
*  He's literally on fan dual right now.
*  Cam Thomas.
*  How many coaches now have gone through the process and like I'm here now and like I've
*  taken over for Jacques Vaughn or whatever and like they still just let him have green light?
*  Well, the other piece of it when he doesn't get the ball late, he gets visibly mad on
*  the TV, which I love.
*  This is the NBA.
*  This is all these late comers and like it's a friendlier brand.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the NBA.
*  That's what it was.
*  These are my roots.
*  This is the 90s coming back where guys just being like I'm shooting 30 times.
*  This is JR Ryder in Minnesota.
*  I'm fucking shooting every time I get the ball.
*  I love it.
*  And the Simmons thing is really fascinating because there's moments where he was all NBA
*  four years ago and there's moments where you think that guy's a real basketball asset.
*  Will somebody talk themselves into him?
*  Coke Presti.
*  There's not enough Coke in Oklahoma.
*  And then I like their swings and there's a lot of trade bait on the team too.
*  Yes.
*  All right.
*  So that was the last pick.
*  Not picked.
*  The Clippers and Washington.
*  100%.
*  Now we knew Washington wasn't going to get picked but the Clippers.
*  The Clippers are depressing.
*  The Clippers did it themselves.
*  They gave the Suns a fight at least.
*  You would only watch for the arena basically.
*  If you've had the Harden experience you would only watch the arena.
*  And it needs to be said again.
*  Harden said he watched the Mavericks go to the finals and Luca was playing his brand
*  of basketball and what he saw was that his brand of basketball is a winning brand of basketball.
*  Confirmation by this is a powerful drug, Was.
*  From last year's NBA playoffs to the James Harden brand of basketball is championship quality.
*  If we have one wish to make to the NBA gods it's that the Clippers trade for Cam Thomas.
*  Oh my god.
*  And the Harden and Thomas get to go bottom and bottom from each possession.
*  I actually think he's one of the great tanking assets any team's ever had.
*  He's not that bad.
*  No.
*  Are you talking about Cam Thomas?
*  I thought you were piling that on James Harden.
*  Cam Thomas puts up points, keeps you in games, casual fans think he's amazing.
*  And ruins your locker room.
*  You're definitely going to lose if he's your best guy and he's going to shoot every time he gets the ball.
*  I think it's wonderful to watch.
*  I'm just glad that guys like this still exist in the league.
*  The league was getting pretty like sand runs.
*  Yeah, very quicker times.
*  All the swings can shoot three of these.
*  All the point guards play certain ways and Cam Thomas is like clear the fuck out.
*  I am scoring.
*  It's my time.
*  It's my time.
*  Oh, they're going to they don't even send doubles at them because they're like, yeah, go ahead.
*  Cook Cam Thomas.
*  Take it.
*  Shoot it.
*  We'll give you 70, man.
*  It's OK.
*  I love that.
*  I really enjoyed watching them last night.
*  Anyway, that's it for the League Pass draft.
