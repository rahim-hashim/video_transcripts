# Better Win for the Mavs or Worse Loss for OKC? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0EpW1ouBho)
*  Better win for Dallas or worse loss for OKC?
*  If you had to start with one of those two.
*  The win.
*  I'm positive on this one.
*  Maybe it's because of OKC's age,
*  and it's certainly just a gut punch there
*  to be in that moment where you're up
*  and then you get the call.
*  But Steve Javie did, I thought, a really good job
*  of explaining why it's actually still a foul
*  because he had the ball and reset
*  was then going into a shot.
*  Because I think when the ball's hit first
*  and there's contact after,
*  it can be really confusing for all of us.
*  I hate the rule.
*  I think the rule should be if you hit the ball first
*  and you can punch the guy in the face after, it's fine.
*  Maybe you had that next year in the NBA.
*  I don't know, I just, I felt like he got the ball.
*  Yeah.
*  Stopped it.
*  I don't, I just, I don't remember seeing that
*  more than five times in my life.
*  I like the call because if you're strong enough
*  to hold the ball to stay in a shooting position with it
*  and then you're fouled after,
*  then you fouled me on the shot attempt.
*  So like, what are we doing?
*  And then PJ steps up and then obviously,
*  I think you had to challenge it.
*  I think you had to, even though that cost him the time out
*  with two seconds left. You had to.
*  And now all of a sudden you're like, okay, great.
*  And then PJ misses the free throw.
*  So everything was really smart there by Dallas at the end.
*  I just think it's so huge for Dallas.
*  You know, because of, you know,
*  hey, is this Kyrie thing really gonna work out?
*  I also think there is a Kyrie conversation
*  that we would have had had they lost this series.
*  That it's like, hey, awesome quotes,
*  but can you shoot more or can you not take off
*  the first 24 minutes every night?
*  Like it's some cool calculated thing
*  because I don't really understand that.
*  But you know, once he turned it on again,
*  he was really good, but he was taking 11 shots a game
*  going into game six.
*  So I think collectively for me, Bill,
*  I didn't watch that game last night going,
*  oh my God, the Thunder have to be kicking their asses.
*  Because there were so many moments
*  where you could see why they were losing.
*  I just think it's a huge positive for Dallas
*  for figuring out the pieces around Luca,
*  the PJ part of it, the Gaffer part of it,
*  the Lively part of it, and then Kyrie feeling like much.
*  The Derek Jones part of it.
*  Yeah, right, but then just the Kyrie stuff is,
*  like for a season here, man, for a season,
*  this has gone about as smooth as it's gone in years with him.
*  So I thought it was just, it was well deserved.
*  Well, like we said, the Retradables,
*  they went all in on this.
*  They either don't have picks from 27 to 30
*  or they're at the worst part of a pick swap.
*  They went in on Kyrie,
*  which I don't think anybody else in the league
*  was lining up to pay him.
*  And they clearly were like, we have this window with Luca
*  and we can't fuck around
*  and we gotta do everything possible.
*  They identified the PJ Washington piece
*  that he was gonna come in and be the guy that he's been,
*  which I just, I didn't see it.
*  I didn't.
*  Well, no one saw him averaging like 20 plus.
*  No, but just like being this super comfortable corner three,
*  rebounder, defender, tough guy,
*  not caring if he was gonna score,
*  selfless piece of a team, didn't see it.
*  I saw the Gaffer, that made sense to me.
*  Lively being that good as a rookie,
*  especially in a big game where he was dominant
*  down the stretch.
*  They had Rizzillo, the last two games,
*  they were plus 29 rebounding.
*  But in the second halves of the last two games,
*  they out rebounded OKC 50 to 28.
*  And there's some OKC stuff,
*  we have to go in there with that.
*  But they had 16 rebounds in the fourth quarter of game six.
*  And OKC, I felt the whole series, I was like,
*  I don't think Dallas's defense is that unbelievable.
*  I think OKC is missing shots they've made all year.
*  OKC scored on eight of their last 11 possessions in game six
*  and Shea hit some fucking nut crunch shots.
*  They still lost.
*  They lost cause they couldn't get rebounds,
*  but Lively and Gaffer were 20 and 17 in game five
*  and a 22 and 22 in game six.
*  Chet and the other Jalen Williams had 10 rebounds total
*  in the last two games.
*  And that was basically it.
*  OKC couldn't get a rebound.
*  It was over and over again.
*  That one sequence when it was 105, 101, offensive rebound,
*  blah, blah, misses the second free throw,
*  they get another offensive rebound in the three
*  and it was just like they just couldn't get rebounds.
*  And Dallas was better.
*  And I thought for the fact that Luka wasn't 100%
*  and they were still able to do what they did,
*  I thought it was a really impressive win by them.
*  I was not a big believer in the Dallas team,
*  but they certainly earned the respect of like,
*  hey man, we don't know who's,
*  we're taping this before Denver, Minnesota,
*  but they at least earned the respect of,
*  they're not gonna be afraid of the next series
*  and the next series will be a battle, right?
*  Yeah, that's how I feel about them now
*  because I just felt like there were so many times
*  over the course of the series where I'd just be watching
*  and kind of go to my default,
*  like who's having an easier time?
*  Just real simple question I ask myself
*  whenever I'm watching a game.
*  It's like, who's having an easier time?
*  Easier shots, easier pace, totally.
*  And it felt like SGA was just having to put the cape on
*  all the time because all these guys around them fall apart,
*  can't hit a shot in game five
*  and an offense that was off the charts
*  in the regular season.
*  It's the second best offense,
*  you can argue it's the best shooting offense,
*  depending on what you wanna look at,
*  but we knew the rebounding numbers were really, really bad
*  and getting into the trade part of it
*  and all the stuff that we've talked about,
*  like we don't know who was actually available
*  and people can look at the Preston resume now,
*  it's like, okay, so I get it, but you think he's bad?
*  You think he's bad at his job?
*  Of course not.
*  I think anybody that's being reasonable
*  would say that he's bad at his job.
*  And we did the trade deadline show
*  right before the Super Bowl
*  and we led with McDonough and talked about
*  how wily the Knicks were.
*  So that's how bad the trade deadline was
*  because McDonough was the headliner,
*  unless you wanna argue that the Thunder
*  should have added somebody like a Siakam or somebody else.
*  I was upset about OKC.
*  Yeah, you were and I think it was a glaring problem
*  in considering all the assets
*  and then when you factor in the Dallas part
*  of helping facilitate that,
*  that's the part where it looks really arrogant
*  and seems to be a problem.
*  I wonder, they clearly need an on-ball guy.
*  They need a third guy beyond Williams
*  who for his first playoff run,
*  it's not shocking that he had some games
*  where he had nothing there
*  and just seemed to not be locked in,
*  but they actually need another guy
*  and I wondered if they thought Hayward was gonna be that,
*  but he was unplayable.
*  I mean, if Dante Exum and Gordon Hayward played one-on-one,
*  whoever had Nex would die because no one would shoot.
*  You'd just be at the park and be like, what happened?
*  He'd be like, oh, he had Nex with Hayward and Exum
*  and he just died because no one would shoot.
*  The weird thing is there's so many swingmen available.
*  They had all these assets.
*  The trade was basically, so the OKC trades,
*  they traded 12 to Dallas for 10 in Bertons
*  and Bertons was clearly a trade contract.
*  Then they traded Bertons, Meachich and Trey Mann.
*  They turned that into Hayward,
*  but then they gave Dallas-
*  They gave us the Meachich number too
*  because now they're 30 plus in cap space.
*  That was the other part.
*  Don't you think they could have given one of their 700 firsts
*  or seconds to a team that take Meachich
*  and just kinda, like I don't feel like they had to do
*  the Hayward trade to get rid of Meachich.
*  I don't get that.
*  You course they could.
*  I just feel like they could have dumped it.
*  He made like seven million a year.
*  It's not like he was at 40.
*  But I can just imagine Presti going,
*  I don't wanna have to pay some tax to move off.
*  I wondered if they thought they'd get something from Hayward.
*  When you watched his minutes, you were like-
*  I think they did, yeah.
*  He was like, you can tell right now.
*  This guy doesn't wanna play right now.
*  Everyone in Charlotte was like, this guy's, he's Washed.
*  We were so psyched we got anything for him.
*  The Dallas thing, the irony of Dallas
*  just not having a first to trade for Gafford.
*  OKC helping them out for this pick swap
*  four years from now and then Gafford ends up killing them.
*  What's Washington doing in that trade?
*  Washington ended up with the 29th pick in the draft.
*  This year's draft that is the worst draft in 11 years.
*  Why not just keep Gafford?
*  I didn't understand that at all.
*  But I went back, I was looking at all the OKC picks.
*  They had the 12th pick this year from Houston.
*  They have all their own firsts
*  through the decade through 2030.
*  They have a bunch of 25 stuff
*  like they can swap for the best equips or Houston.
*  They can also swap for a Philly top six protected.
*  They have Miami's top 14 protected.
*  26 they have Houston top four.
*  They have a Clippers pick swap in 27.
*  They have the Dallas pick swap.
*  They have so much stuff.
*  I just find it really hard to accept that they didn't,
*  they just felt like, oh no,
*  this will be a learning experience this year.
*  We're happy to be here.
*  It's, we can't believe this young team of upstarts
*  made round two because Priscilla,
*  they're fucking in the spot in the KD era.
*  They did the exact same thing
*  where they didn't try to upgrade the team
*  in that 2011 to 14 stretch
*  other than the Jeff Green Perkins trade,
*  which was like a lateral trade of younger guys.
*  But they never, they kind of sat in their lead
*  with the thing and they were like,
*  we just want to be good every year.
*  And I don't think you can have that mentality.
*  Like I really feel like they were one guy away
*  from at least beating Dallas.
*  They were guys short.
*  Okay, but does that mean you think they should have
*  gone in for OG?
*  Should they have gone in for Seahom?
*  Because once Toronto kind of pulled the plug on it earlier,
*  and I don't know if that caught some franchises
*  by surprise because the scattering part of Toronto
*  has always been like, they flirt with you,
*  they flirt with you, they flirt,
*  and then they never want to do anything.
*  And then maybe they felt a little burnt
*  on the Van Vliet thing where it's like,
*  well, we can't have this happen again
*  where you have two guys going to free agency
*  and not getting any assets.
*  And Toronto's like, all right, let's just pull the plug.
*  And Toronto had players, which I think OKC had to pick.
*  So I don't know if that works as well.
*  But Seahom is somebody they had the assets to get.
*  Yeah, it's kind of back to the original thing
*  of who do you want, but who's available?
*  And my guess is that Presti just looked around
*  and was like, well, all these guys that are available,
*  it's not, we're pretty good or whatever.
*  But then it just looks brutal.
*  It looks brutal when you look at the rebounding numbers.
*  It looks brutal when Jalen Williams
*  is your only other big option to not have a third guy
*  who's just big who at least allowed you,
*  if they had gotten through this, to go like,
*  what the hell are they gonna do against Minnesota
*  if Minnesota wins tonight?
*  What were they gonna do against Denver?
*  I mean, can you imagine Jokic against Chet, seven games?
*  Chet looked like he was 180 pounds by the end of round two.
*  We all love Chet.
*  We love Chet, but when you watch him closely around the rim,
*  especially over the course of the game in a series,
*  it's like run blocking.
*  You know, like, hey, how come they're doing this?
*  Or how come they're running this play?
*  And it's like, because this is gonna,
*  these guys are paying a price now,
*  but this is gonna be a bill that's gonna come due
*  in the fourth quarter,
*  and we need to keep running the football.
*  We need to keep doing this.
*  I always feel like whenever you're watching Chet
*  around the rim, you just see him,
*  this toll that he has paid
*  through the first two hours of the game,
*  where it's asking him to do a lot as a rookie with his frame.
*  It was nuts.
*  We agree.
*  But if you flip Gafford,
*  if Gafford is on OKC in this series instead of Dallas,
*  that's a what if for me.
*  If I'm an okay.
*  See fans thinking about that all summer.
*  It's like, why the fuck didn't we get Gafford instead?
*  We helped Dallas get Gafford.
*  They beat us.
*  It's a rough one.
*  I, uh, I have this whole thing I did that I'm not going to do in the pod.
*  I went through every okay.
*  See the last seven years at Durant.
*  Prestige just doesn't make trades is the reality.
*  It's very rare for him.
*  Like he made that Perkins trade.
*  He made the James Harden trade.
*  He, but the hard trade remember too, is that ownership.
*  It was a financial thing, but I'm just saying he made, that was an actual trade he made.
*  Right.
*  They screwed that up though, because they could have just wrote it out for another
*  year, considering what they got back for hard.
*  They absolutely blew it.
*  Right.
*  We, none of us thought Harden was going to end up being, becoming a guy who won
*  MVP's I didn't think it was a dumb trade.
*  Right.
*  They should just pay it hard.
*  It still was a really stupid trade because you just go to ownership and go, Hey, I
*  know what you don't want to do, but we just pay them and we'll figure it out later.
*  Okay.
*  We'll figure it out later because ultimately they were going to have to like, I
*  don't know, man, that's that whole thing.
*  But to me, it's like the Mookie bets trade where they liked what they got.
*  That was part of the trade.
*  They're like, well, we'll price hard.
*  We'll price hard and stats with Kevin Martin.
*  We have this project with Jeremy Lam.
*  We're going to get this awesome pick, which turned out to be Steven Adams.
*  Right.
*  And they were like, we're going to be at least the same.
*  If we do this trade, that was the piece they miss.
*  They trade.
*  I remember that too, Darrell towards, he told Zach Lowe is like, well, we told them
*  we wouldn't have done this deal a year from now.
*  It's like, Oh yeah, no way.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  We definitely would turn that James Harden in 2015.
*  They traded a first for Dion waiters.
*  They traded perk and Reggie Jackson and a first for Enos cancer and DJ Augustine.
*  And then in February, 2016, they traded Augustine and Steve Novak for Randy Foy.
*  Those were all the trades Presti made during the last seven years.
*  Durant was on the team.
*  So he's just, he's a little more hesitant.
*  What's interesting though, the summer of 2016 before Durant left, that was when
*  he traded a Baca to Orlando for old Depot and the rights to sub bonus, which
*  was a fucking awesome trade.
*  And I do wonder like if Katie, if there's no golden state cap spike and Katie just
*  signs a one year deal to stay there in 2017 and they would have had all the
*  Depot and sub bonus and Steven Adams and cancer and Russ again, and maybe like
*  that team that there's another sliding doors where that team might've been, uh,
*  might've been the best team in the league, but we'll never know.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing is that you're saying Presti won't do it, but they don't have
*  these moments of boldness.
*  But why didn't he have the moment of boldness this year?
*  He should have learned from the past.
*  It's like, shit, I have Gilder's Alexander.
*  He's the top four guy in the league.
*  When he did the old Depot deal for Paul George, people were like, okay, but you
*  know, what are you going to do?
*  But then you don't realize like Paul George, if you throw them a party on the
*  night of free agency that he feels like he has to go through, then he signs
*  for four years.
*  Can I give you one other thing from, from the series that I thought, cause it was
*  like, man, Jones and Washington played really well, right?
*  Then you look at the stats, PJ Washington in the first four games, 87 points, 19
*  for 37, three point field goal.
*  The last two games, Derek Jones had 41 points and was seven for 11 from three.
*  These guys, Derek Jones is a career of 31% three point shooter.
*  PJ Washington's a career of 32% three point shooter.
*  So if you're, if you're Dallas, you're like, man, if we could just hit on two of
*  these, on, on, on this wing position, just one guy, a game can come through.
*  Just one Axum, like whoever it is, just please one, can one guy come through
*  just DJ and a PJ.
*  If you just take their best games for the six games, they were 21.3 points a
*  game, 53% from three point from three.
*  And that, that and the rebounds swung the series for them because, and there's one
*  other thing, cause we should have talked about them sooner, you know, 64, 48.
*  Okay.
*  So he had a ton of momentum.
*  Luca just some of the shots he makes that are sometimes bad threes.
*  Sometimes they're like, he's rolling into the lane, like yolkage.
*  But he seems to, he always has a sense of timing for this game slipping away.
*  I need to do something.
*  And he did that.
*  I thought over and over again in the, in the, especially game six, just has a
*  sense of like, they need me right now.
*  I'm going to do it.
*  And that's why he's so dangerous in this next round.
*  He has two playoff runs now of experience, especially on the road where
*  he knows like, it doesn't matter where we play, not going to be afraid.
*  I'll know where to get my spot.
*  So we'll see what happens with Denver, Minnesota tonight.
*  But I certainly, I two weeks ago versus now I feel differently about this Dallas team.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think Luca looked better as the series went along.
*  You figured the three point shooting had to get better.
*  I also, I don't know when I did the numbers.
*  It might've been after game five where I was like, okay, well, wait, like what's,
*  what's going on is Luca getting deep enough, you know, like there's so many
*  times you look at him where you just feel like he can get really deep and then
*  he's just working and he can do the step back.
*  He can do some kind of up and under.
*  He can throw it.
*  He can skip it or he can throw it to the, his corner.
*  And I don't know that I was seeing that from him enough.
*  And, you know, look, I think Oklahoma city did some really good things defensively,
*  but once he knew door had five and they tried to like, get a couple of cats back.
*  Kaysong Wallace possessions against him.
*  It was just like, okay.
*  You know, so Luca, look, I think he's the second best player in the world and.
*  Well, it's kind of what you'd expect from him.
*  Uh, and closing this thing out.
*  And I, I feel like with Dallas here now, I mean, I can't wait to see what happens.
*  I cannot wait to see what happens tonight.
*  Like the series hasn't been close, but it's so much fun.
*  But we're due for, we're due for a close one.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The, uh, and then you mentioned this earlier, but if you're okay, see,
*  you leave that series and it's devastating, but you feel better about SGA
*  as like a real guy, especially, uh, those last couple of games where, you know,
*  you go sideways unless he's like, Oh, I'm a top five guy in the world too.
*  I'll, I'll match these baskets.
*  It's going to be interesting to see him in the Olympics.
*  Cause he, to me now has the gravitas to be in any situation against any team
*  and know he can get to the spot.
*  I thought he got to the spots he wanted the whole series and his team just wasn't
*  consistently good enough around him.
*  They never really figured out their five either, because if they need a little
*  more scoring, they was Isaiah Joe.
*  They want a little more defense.
*  They would put somebody else in.
*  And I thought they, it's weird to say this, but I thought they missed Gidey's
*  rebounding.
*  I know Gidey was kind of a, had become a sunk cost to them some degree, but Gidey
*  was like a, you know, he's like a seven rebounds a game guy.
*  And I wonder like, did they handle that one correctly where they basically lost
*  his, he lost his con they lost confidence in him and vice versa midway through the
*  series.
*  They were scrambling and the problem is, is the Gidey thing just got worse and
*  worse.
*  And, you know, they had talked about how like, Hey, we're still getting good looks.
*  And then there was one game.
*  I remember some of the guys are saying like, Hey, we still won the Gidey minutes
*  or whatever.
*  And you're like, okay, yeah, but like, how does it look?
*  Yeah.
*  And, and try to make SGA try to figure this out with him out there, you know, his
*  game four deal where, you know, they came back in that game too, where they were
*  where, you know, they're down and they outscored him 35, 27 SGA goes for 34.
*  He hit 10 of 14 mid ranges, which is the most in a playoff game since Paul did
*  it five years ago.
*  So there were just these things that SGA was doing.
*  We're in agreement.
*  Cause like moving forward is like, I, you know, I know they lost in the second
*  round, but like it has nothing to do with him.
*  Just a bunch of guys ended up with the ball in their hands that weren't ready.
*  And Wallace had hit a couple threes, I think in game, in game four game four.
*  And, and you were like, okay, well maybe there's something there.
*  And it's like, okay, maybe there also isn't.
*  Maybe he's 20 years old.
*  Right.
*  And as good as he's been this year and it looks like Presti hit on another pick.
*  And I can't get past like some of the Jaylen Williams moments where it's like,
*  dude, and maybe this is just his bad series.
*  You know, Brunson had a bad series early on with the Mavs.
*  I brought up the SGA series with OKC when Chris Paul was there with Schroeder
*  and it looked like he wasn't entirely comfortable.
*  And granted the ball is going to end up in those other guys' hands a little bit more.
*  And, and that's fine.
*  But for this series SGA, this depth, the shooting and this offense around him
*  didn't even look close.
*  And I still think as much as we all like Chet, you're not running a play for Chet.
*  Maybe it's a lob, maybe it's him trailing something and hitting a three.
*  I mean, he had the huge free throws and the huge three in that game for, so all
*  of us feel good about it, but like they got to, they got to do something.
*  Because it'll be funny to see what happens this off season.
*  Well, they're going to trade Gidey.
*  And Gidey will be traded.
*  That's the one thing we know.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw the, I saw the mutual interest with Utah thing, which I was just kind of like
*  an awesome wording.
*  Yeah.
*  That's almost like a mad libs.
*  Can we mention, I should have mentioned this earlier because if I was an OKC fan,
*  I'd be so mad about the Gaffer thing.
*  The other thing I'd be mad about.
*  You're mad about it as a non-fan.
*  You're a.
*  I don't even care.
*  Like I literally don't care about OKC.
*  The other thing that would drive me nuts.
*  They played really good defense on Luca on that last play.
*  They're up one.
*  Luca ends up can't get the shot he wants and kind of dribbles over to where PJ
*  Washington is and just throws it to him and basically fucks him.
*  He's in the corner.
*  Right.
*  And then PJ Washington has to take the game deciding shot of the game.
*  Right.
*  He didn't even have a point in the first three quarters and takes a shot where SGA
*  is coming at him and is close enough to him that he can put his hand on the
*  ball and block it and then hit him after.
*  But what a crazy way to lose your season.
*  You did everything right.
*  Even SGA's play, he did that right.
*  And then you still lose.
*  I, that would drive, that play would drive me nuts.
*  And that so would that four point sequence with four minutes left.
*  I was just like, Oh my God.
*  But Dallas, this is, you know, Dallas over and over again was making the plays.
*  That's why they won the series.
*  They all for their games are pretty close.
*  And at some point in the last four and at some point in the last 12, 10
*  minutes and they pulled all of them out.
*  Play up the experience for Cilla.
*  Yeah.
*  I gotta tell you, man, the, the fouling on the three point line with these guys.
*  I, it was such, it was going to be such a tough shot, but it's so much to ask the
*  player to just deny their instincts of contesting the shot, especially when it's
*  a game winner to potentially eliminate you from the playoffs.
*  Like, you know, you're going to, but it's like, make him make it, man.
*  Make him make it.
*  And he still was clean on top, but once Javi explained it, I was like, you know,
*  that actually makes a lot of sense because you shouldn't be able to foul him after
*  he resets with the ball in his hands.
*  But I look six games.
*  It could have been five.
*  If SGA doesn't go crazy in four, if Chad doesn't hit the corner three, you know,
*  these things have a way of balancing, but over the course of watching these two
*  teams play six times, we did not get a result that wasn't deserving.
*  Dallas was the better team.
*  And I thought they just, their secondary guys were consistently better than OKC's.
*  I'm with you.
*  The better team won.
*  OKC was freaking close and they'll think about it all summer.
*  I want to see what they do.
*  They got to figure out, is that Jaylen Williams spot a real spot?
*  Is that really going to be our backup center rebounder guy?
*  Or are we going to try somebody else there?
*  They got to figure out, can we turn Gideon to another wing?
*  Um, and then what do we do with these draft picks?
*  Do we want to really go in on somebody?
*  But it's funny.
*  Like I'm frustrated that OKC didn't do enough.
*  And yet Dallas, it's almost seemed reckless how much they did.
*  And that was what paid off.
*  And it was great.
*  Right.
*  I mean, Dallas was all in.
*  There was, there was no outs with everything they did.
*  If this didn't work now, it's like we made conference finals.
*  We have a real chance to potentially be the next round.
*  This all worked, but, uh, that's why you gotta go for it sometimes.
*  So if Kawhi's healthy and the Clippers get through them, which is not.
*  A crazy assumption.
*  Yeah.
*  No, maybe Dallas still beats them, but you know, how annoying we can all be
*  after the results would be like, dude, and then they move that and then they,
*  they paid for PJ.
*  It's like, you need to get out of the first round, but I think they were kind
*  of desperate to prove something here to Luca and here we are.
*  And they did.
*  Yeah.
*  My last thing, PJ Washington, who had really not a ton of opinions on, cause I
*  I wasn't sitting around, you know, watching the Hornets over and over
*  again for the last few years, he's just such a fun playoff guy.
*  I love when guys turn into playoff guys.
*  So when you have no idea out of nowhere, you know, deep in
*  change, I was like that too.
*  I think, uh, these guys were in the lights with the pace and the intensity
*  of a game and certain guys, for some reason, it just make, they make
*  more sense in games like that.
*  He's definitely one for me and it was not somebody I would have
*  expected, but they saw it.
*  Kudos to them.
