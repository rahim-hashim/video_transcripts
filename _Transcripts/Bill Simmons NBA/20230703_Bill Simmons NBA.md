# Where Will Damian Lillard End Up? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t585mklgoMc)
*  San Antonio.
*  There was a crafted tweet about how, who said it?
*  It was one of the reporters about how Dame had always had
*  this respect for San Antonio, a deep respect.
*  Deep respect.
*  That's beyond just respect.
*  Deep respect.
*  You think any of that's real?
*  Where did that come from?
*  That threw me for a loop.
*  They certainly had the assets to go after them.
*  And suddenly become an intriguing thing.
*  I think we're both waiting to see what the offense,
*  but the defense I think could be pretty special.
*  Do you believe that one?
*  Because I had trouble believing that one.
*  Why would he want to go there
*  and be part of a rebuilding thing?
*  Like as good as Wemba Nyama is going to be,
*  I just think offensively,
*  there's going to be some rough patches here early on.
*  I would think.
*  Unless, I mean, I don't know.
*  I mean, he's going to come right in and score 20.
*  I think that's...
*  Right, you're saying that's going to be a tough one.
*  I think that's...
*  Right, you're in the finals next year with him probably.
*  Yeah, right.
*  So maybe he scores 20 because there's enough shots
*  for him there with Keldon and Bissell.
*  But I'm looking at it.
*  I'm like, well, if they're not including Keldon Johnson,
*  the McDermott contract.
*  I think Keldon Johnson would have to be in it.
*  Yeah, I mean, that makes a little bit of sense there
*  because then you go, all right,
*  well at least we're getting a young guy that you kind of like.
*  And I like Keldon, but I also wonder,
*  was he the lead guy in a tanking team?
*  So how good is he really going to be?
*  But if you're Portland, you go,
*  hey, who's the best young guy that we can get back
*  to what we actually want?
*  We don't hate his contract.
*  Can you do better than him?
*  You might not be able to do that much better than him.
*  I guess I was just a little surprised that,
*  does Dane think that he would roll into San Antonio
*  with what the rest of that roster is next year
*  and start competing?
*  Would he be patient enough to be like,
*  all right, let's see how another year goes?
*  So it felt like the way these two things are aligned,
*  they just don't seem aligned.
*  What San Antonio's gonna be doing the next couple of years
*  of what Dane is hoping to do before he's done.
*  I'm with you.
*  I was a little surprised by that.
*  I didn't understand.
*  If we're just talking about teams where he could go
*  and have a real chance to win the title
*  other than Miami and Boston,
*  and even Philly, like I don't know if it's just him
*  and Embiid and basically a below average supporting cast,
*  I'm not positive that works either.
*  Minnesota was pretty intriguing to me.
*  And I don't even know if I'd go there, if he'd go there.
*  But if it was Townes,
*  and I don't even know what else they have to offer
*  at this point.
*  But,
*  Townes and,
*  even just Townes for Dane,
*  probably not enough.
*  But I was just trying to think,
*  if you had Go-Bear and Edwards and you kept Slo-Mo
*  and you kept McDaniels and you had Dane,
*  that is a team that I think could compete in a real way.
*  Yeah, because even whatever I think about Minnesota now,
*  I'd expect them to compete next year without-
*  Damon Edwards is like, holy shit,
*  this is gonna be a tough game for us tonight.
*  Yeah, and I think it solves the inevitable Townes problem
*  that you're gonna have.
*  And I don't know if Minnesota,
*  I mean look, I know what they would say.
*  Minnesota would argue, hey, our guy's younger
*  and despite some of the flaws,
*  like this dude puts up crazy numbers
*  and he's one of the best shooting bigs,
*  and he's not 63 million four years from now.
*  So you gotta give us something.
*  You gotta give us a Sweetener.
*  And Portland's going, your guy isn't even close
*  to being the same guy as our guy
*  and then we'd have to re-sign him anyway.
*  We already know what all the different arguments would be,
*  but I don't think it'd be like one side is overwhelming
*  the other one with Sweetener on top
*  of one of those two players, right?
*  Or maybe I keep throwing in Houston
*  because Houston seems to me,
*  they have all these young assets
*  that aren't ready to play yet,
*  and they also signed Fred Van Vleet and Dylan Brooks.
*  So I'm like, does this team,
*  are they trying to be good right now?
*  And if they're trying to be good right now,
*  maybe they'd want towns.
*  And maybe they'd give all the assets to Portland
*  and then Dame goes to Minnesota.
*  I can't wait to talk about Houston.
*  I think we save Houston for part two.
*  Yeah, no, I get it, I get it.
*  But imagine them going like, hey look,
*  we can't do this deal now,
*  but Dylan Brooks has been here 48 hours.
*  And he hasn't bought us in, there's no games.
*  There's no games, but he was picking up garbage
*  the other day, which I don't know if you'd read
*  that Anthony Richardson did that, Colts quarterback.
*  So that's a huge sign of future success
*  if you pick up garbage at an event after everybody leaves.
*  So I just, I don't, when I saw the Houston stuff
*  and when some of those contracts became eligible
*  to even be traded, you know.
*  But look, it kind of just gets back to the point
*  that we started an hour ago.
*  If these are the offers and I'm Portland.
*  You're waiting.
*  And waiting, you have to wait till December, January.
*  And then you go like, well, what's the downside to it?
*  Oh, Dame isn't happy.
*  I think the cool thing about Dame,
*  and it's kind of the Durant thing,
*  where when you have Durant on your team
*  and you're Brooklyn and you're like,
*  all right, this guy wants everybody fired
*  right after you got the extension
*  and he wants all that stuff to work out.
*  It's like, well, guess what he loves to do?
*  He loves playing basketball.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think Lillard.
*  Let's use that against him.
*  Yeah, I think Lillard is probably more on that line.
*  I think of the bigger city teams,
*  the irony of like, okay, see Utah, New Orleans
*  who have all these assets,
*  but it's really hard to lure a guy like Dame
*  who's in a smaller market to be like,
*  come to our small market instead.
*  Like, I think Brooklyn,
*  at least with all the Phoenix first
*  and the swap they have and the Dallas pick
*  and the Philly picks,
*  like they have the assets to pull something.
*  They have Dinwiddie.
*  I can't believe I'm saying this,
*  but I still feel like Simmons is at least intriguing
*  if I'm a rebuilding team.
*  Like Portland to me is perfect.
*  Portland is perfect.
*  Just put him there with Scoot in the middle of nowhere.
*  And worst case scenario is an expiring contract in a year.
*  But as we covered earlier,
*  I'm still not sure where that gets me
*  if I'm Brooklyn ultimately.
*  I at least have a,
*  I now have Dame and Bridges and Cam Johnson.
*  And I have a poster for the subway.
*  When people run the subway, it's like Nets.
*  It's a new era.
*  The new big three, whatever.
*  At least I have that.
*  Dame is somebody that I do think people would go to see
*  in the New York area.
*  They don't have a person like that now.
*  So I can kind of talk myself into that.
*  I just don't know if I'm Dame.
*  Am I in a better spot?
*  I like that you brought up those other teams
*  because you feel like Utah with all the future picks.
*  Because that's probably what Portland's going to end up doing.
*  Utah is the most.
*  If Utah is like, we'd like Dame Lillard and they,
*  it's like, what's it going to take?
*  They have the most to offer.
*  Because it's picks.
*  They're basically the real estate buyer from Russia
*  who just is paying all cash
*  and they don't even have to,
*  they don't even need the inspection.
*  They're just like, here's a suitcase.
*  That's Utah.
*  They're like, we have 12 first-round picks.
*  Did you sell a house to a Russian recently?
*  That seemed kind of specific.
*  I don't know, I was just making a joke.
*  Utah has all those picks plus a couple young assets.
*  They can throw Sexton in there.
*  They can make basically, they have a Linux expiring.
*  They can make anything work.
*  But with Dame Lillard, be like, cool,
*  I'm going from Portland to Utah.
*  And then where am I going?
*  I have to imagine that he's like,
*  I'd like to go to one of the big cities now.
*  Right.
*  This time around, even beyond Miami.
*  But all the big cities have their guys already.
*  Like the Lakers and the Quippers, they're kind of set.
*  The Knicks, Brunson's the most popular Nick in 15 years.
*  They're not going to get Dame.
*  Miami doesn't have enough.
*  So that list goes down pretty fast.
*  The Orlando Magic, are Palo and Franz
*  ready to be the big three with Dame?
*  I'm sure Orlando would be like,
*  hey, if he wants to come here, he can put something together.
*  But I can't imagine that he's,
*  I think the Miami thing is the trust in them
*  having the best coach,
*  seeing what they just did without him,
*  how great they are on the margins
*  with all these other players,
*  which you don't expect that to just kind of run its course.
*  But I also think I'd be like afraid of signing
*  some of their guys away from them with the strews money.
*  Look, the Gabe Vincent deal's a really good deal
*  for the Lakers with that kind of price.
*  So I tried all morning.
*  I tried all morning and I kept looking at stuff
*  and I was trying to be realistic.
*  And I was like, I can't tell if this is going to be
*  one of the classic NBA lessons where you go,
*  oh, I guess they just did it.
*  Like, why did I put any time into this?
*  Like he just got his way, right?
*  Or if it's going to be one of the rare times
*  with the more recent developments of players
*  having this much time left on their contract,
*  going, oh, no, I don't care.
*  This isn't the year left thing.
*  This isn't the lame duck situation.
*  The money's mine.
*  All that money is mine.
*  And now I'd like to go somewhere else and I don't care.
*  And some GMs would give in.
*  And that's why I kind of defend Darrell a little bit
*  in the past because I thought what he did with Simmons
*  in a really tough spot.
*  But I don't know.
*  I don't know, in a weird way, like am I rooting for that?
*  Like am I rooting for some teams just to start going,
*  no, sorry, no, we're not giving you away.
*  Sorry, dude.
*  If you're a Blazer fan,
*  wouldn't you be like, hey, man,
*  we actually have a really nice young foundation now.
*  If you're going to trade Dame Lillard,
*  can you actually get real value back for him?
*  Like, do we have to give him away to, you know,
*  thanks for everything, Dame, for the last 11, 12 years,
*  but if it's okay with you,
*  can I not get 30 cents in the dollar for our best asset?
*  Is that cool?
*  Can we get a real trade back for you?
*  Thanks.
*  That's how I would feel if I was a Blazer fan.
*  That's why I always loved the Kobe to Chicago one so much,
*  because they were like, all right,
*  I guess it'd be like Lulal and then whatever.
*  And then Kobe was like, no, like I want.
*  Yeah, I need those guys on my team.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't want you to trade.
*  You know, because some of these get so out of control
*  where it's, okay, I want the max deal.
*  Oh, and by the way, now I want to be traded,
*  but don't trade any of the good players
*  because I want them there too when I go
*  so I can have a chance to compete
*  and, you know, get back to me by the end of the week.
*  And you're just like, what?
*  What?
*  Well, that's why with Phoenix,
*  putting cam and bridges in the trade
*  is kind of nuts in retrospect.
*  The desperation they had to get that deal done,
*  I just, I still don't fully understand it.
*  Especially too, when Ramona had the piece
*  after the fact that was like,
*  they wanted to make sure it didn't turn into a bidding war.
*  Guess what?
*  If Durant is telling me, who by the way said,
*  I should be fired this summer, going back a year,
*  and then has the extension,
*  and then decides, actually, I'm out of here too,
*  after Kyrie makes his trade demand,
*  I'm shopping that around.
*  I'm sure, but, you know, I don't know how much better you do
*  than bridges and then all of those picks.
*  I made up a trade, I'm gonna read it to you right now.
*  That involves, and again, Jalen Brown,
*  Saruti, please keep checking Twitter
*  to make sure Jalen Brown didn't sign the extension.
*  But let's say Dame goes to Boston
*  and Jalen goes to Houston.
*  And now if I'm Portland,
*  and I have my pick of Houston assets,
*  Rosillo, would you rather have Jalen Green
*  or Jabari, or Jabari Smith?
*  Jabari Smith.
*  Okay.
*  Would you rather have Cam Whitmore or Eason?
*  I gotta tell ya, like, you know,
*  and by the way, going back to last week,
*  I feel like it got played a little bit more
*  that it was about the background stuff.
*  It was the knee, which I tried to emphasize last week.
*  Cam Whitmore dropped more because of the knee,
*  even though I added more context to it,
*  which kind of turned into something that was beyond.
*  But look, I think I'd like Tarri Eason better,
*  even though he's not the player Cam Whitmore is.
*  It's just there's enough teams out there that were like,
*  you know, don't worry about the injuries.
*  So you would agree, really, really, I'm surprised.
*  I think I'm on a high.
*  I like Eason, I think he's good.
*  So Jabari.
*  I think Eason's one of those guys
*  that I had a harder time with at LSU,
*  but now when I watch him in the process,
*  just throw him out there and watch him do stuff.
*  He gives a shit.
*  Jabari, Eason, Porter's contract, which seems prohibitive,
*  but it's really a one-year deal.
*  And you can get out of it after next season.
*  Malcolm Brogdon, who they can flip if they want,
*  and a couple of those Brooklyn picks that Houston has.
*  And if I'm Portland, that's a pretty good trade.
*  And I'm getting Jabari Smith and Eason and some picks,
*  and I can flip Brogdon into something else.
*  And I think I would rather do that
*  than anything Miami has to offer.
*  Now, Jaylen might sign his extension two minutes from now,
*  but I'm just a little suspicious it hasn't happened yet.
*  Anyway, my point is there's way better stuff out there,
*  and it's also a trade like who knows
*  when we get to December, January,
*  who knows who's gonna be desperate.
*  They think, I don't know.
*  I just would not trade him now.
