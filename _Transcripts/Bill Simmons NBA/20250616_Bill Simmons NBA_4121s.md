# Doc Rivers on the Jalen Williams Game, MJ’s Bulls and Giannis’s Future | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k)
*  Alright, we're recording at 830 Pacific time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=0.0s)]
*  Doc Rivers is here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=28.88s)]
*  It's been a while for us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  We just watched game five of the 2025 finals. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=32.68s)]
*  You're in Florida. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=37.4s)]
*  I'm in California. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=38.4s)]
*  I guess that's the Jalen Williams game. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=39.56s)]
*  There might be many more games for him to come. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=41.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's the Jalen Williams game. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=44.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=46.44s)]
*  And the Shea game. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=47.44s)]
*  And I really think it was more the Oklahoma bench game. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=48.44s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=51.76s)]
*  You know, I don't know how often this happens, but the road players play better at home. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=53.08s)]
*  You know, obviously, you know, so did the Pacers road players on the road. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  They all play well as well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  And obviously Halliburton, I think he's injured. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=65.2s)]
*  Didn't have a lot tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=68.44s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Jalen, Shea, and the road players were the difference in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=70.4s)]
*  game. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=75.8s)]
*  So Jalen Williams over the course of the playoffs, where you think he's got to be at least the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=76.92s)]
*  Pippen, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=82.64s)]
*  Not to compare anyone to Michael Jordan, but he's got to be the Robin, the Pippen. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=84.28s)]
*  That side, it's like, is this a year too early for him? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=88.12s)]
*  Is this Scottie Pippen in 1990? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=91.44s)]
*  Or is he actually ready for this? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=94.08s)]
*  And the way he's played the last three nights, especially tonight, this felt like Pippen [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=96.12s)]
*  in 91 when they just blew the doors out of anybody and he's guard of magic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=101.32s)]
*  And he just went up and it was like, oh shit, this guy's like one of the best 12, 13 guys [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=105.44s)]
*  in the league now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=110.12s)]
*  The stuff he was doing off the dribble, how comfortable he was going left hand, going [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=112.08s)]
*  right hand. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=116.32s)]
*  I don't know what the ceiling is anymore for him, Doc. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=117.32s)]
*  You know what's interesting is a couple of things. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=122.24s)]
*  Number one, last year he really struggled. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Everyone forced him right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=127.48s)]
*  That was the scouting port that every team had. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  If you can force him right, he struggles. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=131.96s)]
*  He went back to the lab, worked on it all summer. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=134.36s)]
*  Nothing better from a coach standpoint when you see a player come back the next NBA season [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  and has worked on all the things that he needed to work on. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=144.32s)]
*  And he went back. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I can't imagine the hours that he put in, but then I thought he was struggling [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  a tad bit at the beginning of this series. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  And Bill, this is where the difference meets. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=156.32s)]
*  Some guys kind of will under that pressure back to back years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=161.28s)]
*  And it's almost like he has willed himself like, no, I'm that guy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=166.36s)]
*  I've arrived and I'm going to prove it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=171.44s)]
*  And I'm not going to be denied. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=173.72s)]
*  That's how he's playing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=175.64s)]
*  This is as physical and as tough as I've ever seen him play. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=176.64s)]
*  And he's playing back diffusely. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=181.16s)]
*  I went to the two Indiana games and I thought, especially in the second half of game four, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=183.0s)]
*  he really took it to Siakam. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=188.16s)]
*  And he took it to him physically and just athletically everything. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=190.72s)]
*  But really physically, that's the big difference I've noticed just in seeing him in person [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=193.6s)]
*  over the course of the last couple of years is he's starting to use his body in a different [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=198.56s)]
*  way combined with the speed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=202.28s)]
*  And now guys are playing off them because they know they're going to lose the bounce [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=204.2s)]
*  off stuff. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=207.72s)]
*  But I remember, you know, not to bring Yanis into this so early, but I remember when Yanis [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=208.72s)]
*  started to figure that out the first couple of years of his career where he had the athleticism. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=212.8s)]
*  But as he got stronger, he figured out how to use his body and bounce off dudes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  And it feels like that's happening for for Williams. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=221.56s)]
*  You've gone against him. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=224.88s)]
*  You went against him in the cup. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=226.0s)]
*  By the way, congrats on the commissioners cup. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=227.0s)]
*  We haven't had you on the pod since you won the commissioners cup. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=229.0s)]
*  My gosh. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=234.56s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=235.56s)]
*  Did you bring the trophy to Florida or where did you keep it in your house? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=238.56s)]
*  I kept it in Milwaukee right where it should belong. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=242.56s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=245.8s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=246.8s)]
*  And I will say our thoughts going into that game and we got away with it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Our size kind of ate them up like we were the more physical team. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=254.72s)]
*  You can see that we knew we had to make it a physical contest. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=260.32s)]
*  We knew going into that game, if we made it about athleticism and speed, then we had no [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=264.56s)]
*  chance. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=268.92s)]
*  But if we made it about size and power that they had no chance. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  That's why we won that game. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=274.12s)]
*  What I'm impressed with with Williams and shade. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=276.36s)]
*  I don't think we talk enough about shade is not only do they play through the physical [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=278.68s)]
*  contact now, but they get their balance back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  See, a lot of people can take a hit. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=286.56s)]
*  Most people can't get back on balance and take a shot. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  That little turnaround, the little shimmy turnaround that he shot towards, I think it [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=292.24s)]
*  was the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=296.24s)]
*  He didn't have that game. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=299.36s)]
*  He didn't have that midseason. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=300.36s)]
*  Now we still adding as the playoffs is going on. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=302.8s)]
*  So it is pretty impressive. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=305.0s)]
*  So do you think they learned anything from that commissioners cup game? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=306.88s)]
*  As weird as that question is, because I remember we were talking about that during the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=309.68s)]
*  holidays and you were like, yeah, we we were able to overpower them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=313.72s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone's overpowering this version of the thunder. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. No. And I do think it's funny when Mark said after that game something, this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  is a lesson that we'll put into our bag and and that we've learned that there's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=324.68s)]
*  another brand of physicality that we're going to have to come up with. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=331.12s)]
*  And I thought, you know, I don't know if that game mattered. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  It did matter, but I don't know if that game taught him anything. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=337.76s)]
*  But I do know that they put that in and said we cannot let a team just play [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  bully ball against us. And that's what we virtually did. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=345.32s)]

*  So what did you see from tonight? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, India dominates OKC. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=380.36s)]
*  Well, they didn't dominate, but the first three quarters of game four, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=383.0s)]
*  they're in control of the game. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=386.32000000000005s)]
*  It feels like they have it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  They're up 10 for like three minutes near the end of the third quarter, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=389.48s)]
*  and they can't kind of put the game away. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=392.12s)]
*  OKC can't hit a three, you know, and then OKC brings the game back with their [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  defense. What was different about tonight? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, first, the game the other night, I thought that was the first time [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=402.6s)]
*  in the end that looked up and started thinking results for a second, you know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  and it happens in the finals, man. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=411.0s)]
*  You you look at that scoreboard and you're thinking, man, we win this game. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=413.16s)]
*  We want to weigh. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=416.92s)]
*  I thought in the end of play differently in the fourth quarter. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=417.96s)]
*  I thought they blew it to in the third. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=423.64s)]
*  I think I text you and say, wow, this game should be a 10 to 12 point game. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=425.68s)]
*  And it's now six or four or whatever it was. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=430.68s)]
*  And that allowed Oklahoma back in it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, as good as Indiana is down the stretch, Oklahoma is pretty good [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=436.84s)]
*  because they have shade. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=440.4s)]
*  And that's that was Shays game to me the other night. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  Tonight was Jaylen's game. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  Today was a different pace. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=447.8s)]
*  What they do, Bill, they don't stop. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=449.24s)]
*  You know, they just keep coming. They keep coming. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=451.12s)]
*  They keep playing. They keep playing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=452.72s)]
*  And then eventually you wear down. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=454.36s)]
*  I thought there were points in the game tonight that Oklahoma was close [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=456.08s)]
*  to going to the other way. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=460.0s)]
*  You know, Indiana would turn the ball over. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  Someone would take a bad shot, which Indiana did more tonight [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=464.24s)]
*  than I've seen all year. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=468.0s)]
*  And then Jaylen Williams just took the game over. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  So that's the difference. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=472.2s)]
*  Yeah, I had written down. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=473.88s)]
*  So it was they got it to two. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=475.16s)]
*  The first part of the fourth quarter with that incredible [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=478.56s)]
*  TJ McConnell brings them back in the third quarter is 15. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=481.4s)]
*  He's doing every he's playing that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  It's like TJ McConnell, greatest hits, basically. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  They got it to two. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=488.4s)]
*  OKC misses big offensive rebound, swings out to Jaylen Williams. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=490.48s)]
*  He hits a three then turnover. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=495.92s)]
*  They get a fast break. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=499.0s)]
*  Wallace layup all sudden at seven again. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=500.04s)]
*  So there was a split second where I felt like, oh, my God, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  Indiana is going to do the thing they did for the first three rounds. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=504.92s)]
*  And then it just flipped almost immediately. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=507.88s)]
*  I mean, the offensive rebounds in this game. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=510.32s)]
*  At one point, there was 32 combined. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=512.48s)]
*  I'm just seeing what they what we ended with. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=515.44s)]
*  We ended with, you know what it was, though, that there were 37 [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=517.44s)]
*  rebounds for 37 in the game for both sides. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  But none of them were at the rim. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=525.16s)]
*  It felt like because there are a lot of long threes, there are a lot of long rebounds. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=527.12s)]
*  And there was a stretch where Indiana was getting off of. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=531.44s)]
*  I thought Matthew did a great job on the glass, just collecting them. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=534.2s)]
*  They're just scrappy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  But then I thought Hardenstein got a huge one. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=540.72s)]
*  You know, both teams are really working the glass [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  because what's going on in this series, it seems like there's a stretch in every game [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=549.48s)]
*  where one team goes small and the other team is bigger. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=554.6s)]
*  And the bigger team dominates the glass. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=558.32s)]
*  And that happened again tonight. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=560.44s)]
*  So we watched game one of Celtics Knicks together [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=562.68s)]
*  and you were calling out all the hunting that was going on on both sides. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=566.16s)]
*  Right. And, you know, that was pretty early in a series for two teams [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=570.52s)]
*  to try to figure out what they want to do offensively. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=574.68s)]
*  As this series went along, we had game four [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=577.0s)]
*  where they try to do the with SGA setting screens for Jalen Williams, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=579.92s)]
*  them trying to do that two man game. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  That was the only way to unlock how bad their three point shooting was. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  What did you what did they figure out tonight? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  Because it seemed like a lot of it was Jalen Williams just going downhill and Shea. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=591.32s)]
*  They scored most of the points and then Wallace and Wiggins. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=595.24s)]
*  I think they had like six threes between them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=597.6400000000001s)]
*  That's it. But did you see anything else they figured out? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=600.44s)]
*  Yeah, I thought dribble penetration. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=603.12s)]
*  I thought Oklahoma made a concerted effort, especially early in the game, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=604.72s)]
*  to get to the bank. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=608.24s)]
*  And they got to the paint and made plays, not necessarily shoot the ball. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=609.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, Shea had a very assist night that didn't take but one. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  He had more assists tonight. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=618.2s)]
*  I thought they set the tone early with their dribble penetration [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=619.56s)]
*  and those guys made shots right. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=623.4799999999999s)]
*  And then down the stretch, because the other guys were making shots, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=625.2399999999999s)]
*  it felt like Indiana, they didn't leave guys as easy as they've been leaving guys. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=628.92s)]
*  They were worried about Oklahoma making threes tonight. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=633.16s)]
*  And that allowed Jalen Williams and Shea to get to their elbows and make shots. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=636.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, and that was the difference. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  I thought the dribble penetration, they clearly came into this game [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=643.1199999999999s)]
*  thinking, let's get to the bank. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=647.2399999999999s)]
*  So they had a 40-32 lead with eight minutes left in the second quarter. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=648.84s)]
*  40 points for OKC, they had 12 assists and they had 10 on game four. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  So you're right. It was like they made a concerted effort. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=658.72s)]
*  The ball's got to move. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=661.32s)]
*  When they move the ball and that just opens up. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's that's what falls apart. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=665.84s)]
*  I thought we keep going back to game four. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=668.4s)]
*  I kept thinking in game four. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=670.88s)]
*  We a very important step for coaches is shot quality, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=673.36s)]
*  like your shot quality, like, you know, you can you can win a game [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=677.52s)]
*  and have poor shot quality because you've had shot makers in Oklahoma, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=681.2s)]
*  wins a lot of games because Shea and Jalen Williams are able to make tough shots. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=684.88s)]
*  But when you watch that game for every shot, Indiana took was wide open [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=690.4s)]
*  and they got it from ball moving to making the next shot. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=695.0s)]
*  And every shot Oklahoma took was contested and tough. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's how Indiana got that big lead. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=702.2s)]
*  And then in the fourth quarter, it flipped. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=704.44s)]
*  And then it carried back over to tonight. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=707.0s)]
*  Oklahoma was making plays for each other. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  They were making the extra pass. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  Indiana always plays that way. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=713.4s)]
*  So they still got theirs. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=715.44s)]
*  The difference is Oklahoma shot quality tonight was really good. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=717.0s)]
*  And it's because they made extra passes. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So game the second half of game four [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=723.44s)]
*  was just about as good defensively as I've ever seen anyone play in person. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=728.32s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=732.2s)]
*  And it got to the point where it just felt like over and over again [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=733.64s)]
*  with seven seconds left on the shot clock. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=736.84s)]
*  Indiana was 30 feet from the basket trying to figure out, OK, now [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=739.3199999999999s)]
*  I guess I got to get a shot up. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=742.72s)]
*  They carried that over into the first half. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=745.04s)]
*  I felt like OKC really did. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  And Bill, the biggest difference is that Oklahoma has a guy [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=750.56s)]
*  like they can play low shot clock games because they have two guys, really. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=754.24s)]
*  With Jalen Williams and and and Shea. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=758.92s)]
*  Indiana, that's the one thing that they really don't have. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=761.72s)]
*  They have a lot of guys that make plays, but they don't have the one guy, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=765.2800000000001s)]
*  maybe see them because we get the ball to see on the elbow in the right place. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=769.2s)]
*  He's pretty dynamic, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  But but other than that, they don't. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=775.24s)]
*  That's not how they play. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=777.5200000000001s)]
*  They don't play the ice so into the clock game. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=780.0400000000001s)]
*  And Oklahoma can do that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  And so that's been the difference since, you know, mid [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=784.7600000000001s)]
*  second half of game four so far. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=788.84s)]
*  And it showed itself today again. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=791.44s)]
*  Well, so when you hear. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=793.96s)]
*  OK, so I don't know if they're the best defense I've ever seen, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=796.28s)]
*  but they'd be one of the first ones I think of. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=798.88s)]
*  Well, I faced the bulls and well, that's the thing. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=801.96s)]
*  So I saw the nine. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=805.44s)]
*  I saw the 90s bulls. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=807.2s)]
*  The you're talking about all four pistons. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=809.28s)]
*  There's there's been some great ones over the years were physical. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=811.96s)]
*  You know, so they had a brand. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=816.64s)]
*  Our 2008 Celtics were tough, but I still listen, I've [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=818.6s)]
*  I played against all of them and that one year with the bulls, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, Ron Harper, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=828.0s)]
*  Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Michael Jordan. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=830.96s)]
*  I mean, those are four elite, elite, elite defenders. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=834.84s)]
*  I don't think there was a better defensive team than that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=840.24s)]
*  with the size and quickness. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=842.84s)]
*  But this team is similar. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=844.96s)]
*  They rival it a little bit. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=847.52s)]
*  And they're they're they come in droves like the bulls when you can stop at four or five. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=850.9200000000001s)]
*  They're seven, eight deep defensively. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=855.52s)]
*  You don't hear that very often when you talk about teams, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  usually the great defensive teams, they have a one or two guys [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  that are great defensively than everybody else or more team defenders. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=865.52s)]
*  What separates Oklahoma and you can put Indiana [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=869.48s)]
*  who is very underrated defensively. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=873.12s)]
*  They have a ton of solid individual defensive players. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=875.76s)]
*  And that's what makes this series so intriguing. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=879.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad you brought up the 90s bulls, because it's the only other time [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=882.88s)]
*  I've ever seen that in person of people, multiple guys [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=886.96s)]
*  picking up ball handlers at midcourt and it almost seeming like defensive backs, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=890.8s)]
*  like jamming the line of scrimmage on receivers and the receivers [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=895.76s)]
*  being unable to get off the line of scrimmage. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=898.76s)]
*  Like what they were doing to Halliburton. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=901.08s)]
*  And today he was hurt, which we'll talk about in a second. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=903.2s)]
*  But he wasn't not only was he not getting the spots he wanted to go to, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  they were disrupting them 45 feet from the basket, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  which is what the what those teams used to do. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  They used to be like two pit bulls waiting for people at midcourt. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=917.1600000000001s)]
*  One of the things the bulls did that I don't think any other team has ever done [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=920.6800000000001s)]
*  in the history of the game is the way they trap. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=924.64s)]
*  You know, usually what you do is you send a guy to the sideline [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=930.2s)]
*  and then you bring them back to the middle and you trap. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=935.64s)]
*  The bulls actually would send a guy to the sideline. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=939.24s)]
*  And as a guard, I remember this. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=941.4399999999999s)]
*  You thought, OK, now I can beat them down the sideline. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=943.24s)]
*  But the guy guarding you would actually beat you to the sideline [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=945.64s)]
*  and then you would turn back and there's another defender. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=948.84s)]
*  And you're basically in the web. It's over. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=952.4399999999999s)]
*  No one's ever been able to do that type of trapping in the front court. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=956.04s)]
*  They did it in the back court. They did it all the time. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=960.48s)]
*  And I thought they did one other thing that no one ever talks about. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=964.04s)]
*  We actually discussed it once. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=967.4s)]
*  They would trap the passer that was going to throw it to the post. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=969.52s)]
*  If you remember that against Orlando, they figured out, OK, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=973.44s)]
*  they're going to always throw it to the wing to throw it to Shaq. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=978.32s)]
*  So what they did, they trapped the passer [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=981.28s)]
*  and the passer now is throwing it out away. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=984.32s)]
*  He forgets about Shaq by the time they got it to Shaq. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=987.12s)]
*  It's three seconds on the clock. I thought that was genius. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=989.96s)]
*  I mean, that was Phil. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=993.32s)]
*  But that was really they had four pit bulls that could get away with it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=994.76s)]
*  And I've never seen a team do that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=998.5600000000001s)]
*  I will say Oklahoma, they don't do that, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1000.84s)]
*  but they have enough the defenders that they may be able to get away [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1004.64s)]
*  with something like that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1007.72s)]
*  Yeah, I would say the difference between them and the bulls defensively, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1008.96s)]
*  the bulls probably had the higher ceiling with those four. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1012.52s)]
*  But there's a relentlessness because they just bring more guys in. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1015.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, this guy's in really. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1018.48s)]
*  And it just kind of never stops. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1021.64s)]
*  Can you imagine you're already struggling trying to score [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1024.44s)]
*  and then they bring Caruso in? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1027.28s)]
*  You know, that is unbelievable when you think about it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
*  So as a coach, because you're you're coaching the Milwaukee Bucks right now [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1033.24s)]
*  and you're in this league that has Oklahoma City in it, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1037.56s)]
*  that I don't even feel like is the team. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1040.6000000000001s)]
*  They're going to be two, three years from now. Right. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1043.24s)]
*  This is they're at like the start of whatever journey it is. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1045.56s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be two years, five years, seven years, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1048.64s)]
*  but it's the beginning of it when you see that they're already at this point now. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1051.24s)]
*  How many teams can you remember since you've been playing or coaching? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1056.36s)]
*  Where you're going, oh, shit, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1060.48s)]
*  not only are they the best team right now, but we're not even where we're going to go yet. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1062.8s)]
*  Well, listen, we've both been around this league a long time [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1069.44s)]
*  and you're right today. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1072.84s)]
*  But you know, this league, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  I still remember Jeff and Gandhi, Mark Jackson [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1078.8s)]
*  and my brain talking about the Oklahoma City Thunder. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1082.84s)]
*  And when they are losing to Miami, well, this is a tough loss. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1086.32s)]
*  But they'll be back here over and over again. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1090.24s)]
*  This is the first time they've been back. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  So you can never take it for granted. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1094.8s)]
*  And they also have some things coming up called. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1096.8799999999999s)]
*  Max contracts. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1100.72s)]
*  And paying guys. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1102.32s)]
*  And, you know, what Sam has done is amazing when you think about it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1103.6s)]
*  He's done this without, you know, shape, really. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1107.36s)]
*  But next year, after this season [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1110.48s)]
*  or in a year, they're going to have to start paying guys. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1114.08s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, they probably won't be as deep [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1117.48s)]
*  as they are now because they're going to have to make some tough decisions. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1121.04s)]
*  They've done this once and they decided on [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1124.12s)]
*  who did they decide on over hard? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1128.96s)]
*  And I can't remember that the center that it was. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1130.48s)]
*  It was Hardin and they kept the Baca and Perkins, basically. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1133.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1136.8s)]
*  So they kept the Baca at the time over Hardin, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1138.16s)]
*  which turned out to be, you know, not the best decision in the world. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1142.24s)]
*  And I think honestly, I thought they felt like Hardin wanted to go [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1147.52s)]
*  somewhere and have his own team. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1150.76s)]
*  So, you know, they were making the decisions more about team building [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1152.72s)]
*  than just about individual talent. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1156.6s)]
*  So it looks a lot worse than what it actually is. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1158.12s)]
*  But that's the only thing that's going to slow this team down. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1160.9599999999998s)]
*  And like, you know, I'm a coach at NBA. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1163.6399999999999s)]
*  I want to win a title. Right. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1166.04s)]
*  You know, the earliest if Oklahoma City was this one, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1167.32s)]
*  then then they they've been made, you know, always use that word. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1173.12s)]
*  You've been made. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1176.4799999999998s)]
*  And now you're going to have to deal with them. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1177.6799999999998s)]
*  Nothing. Once you win, nothing can shake your confidence. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1179.9599999999998s)]
*  The only way you knock them out now is you're going to have to kill them. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1184.76s)]
*  So this series isn't over, but we do know. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1188.56s)]
*  And that's going to happen with either team that wins it, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1192.28s)]
*  but especially Oklahoma, because they're so young. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1194.52s)]
*  We'll take a quick break. Come back. Talk about Halbert. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1198.6s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by Verbo Private Vacation Rentals. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1200.92s)]
*  Verbo, you can save over $200 on select homes when you stay for a week or more. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1204.12s)]
*  Say if you wanted to go catch a couple of baseball games in Boston, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1209.12s)]
*  take some time off work, flying to Beantown, watch the Sox play. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1214.04s)]
*  After that, you can do anything. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1218.3600000000001s)]
*  You can go book a Verbo and Cape Cod for a week. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1219.44s)]
*  The world is your oyster or lobster roll or clam chowder. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1222.04s)]
*  Really? It has shells, gills, and it's indigenous to the Atlantic. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1226.08s)]
*  It's your edible metaphor of choice. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1230.08s)]
*  Their crustacean crazy around there. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1232.2s)]
*  Guess what? Since you stayed longer than a week, you saved over $200. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1233.92s)]
*  You know what that means? More shellfish. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1238.1200000000001s)]
*  I love shellfish. Hope you're not allergic. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1239.76s)]
*  Next vacation, stay longer and save. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1241.8s)]
*  Make it a Verbo. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1244.32s)]
*  Halbert was clearly hurt. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1245.52s)]
*  I don't know when it happened. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1246.92s)]
*  And we live in this culture, especially when there's time between games, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1249.32s)]
*  when whoever didn't play well in the previous finals game, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1252.4s)]
*  that that's a person that just takes all the shit for the next 36 hours. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1255.52s)]
*  He didn't look right. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1259.12s)]
*  It's interesting watching this in a 2025 context, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1260.32s)]
*  because we've seen some awesome players now have calf strains, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1263.44s)]
*  try to play through them, and then something more horrible happens. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1267.76s)]
*  Durant was the most famous example. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1271.24s)]
*  Tatum in the Knicks series, I don't think his legs were 100% before that happened. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1273.52s)]
*  So in the back of your head, you're watching this. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1278.36s)]
*  And on the one hand, especially your generation, it's like you're hurt. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1280.24s)]
*  Get out there. Keep playing. You got to help the team. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1283.44s)]
*  But that has become the scariest injury, I feel like, in sports now, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1286.12s)]
*  when somebody has calf strain and they're stretching it out. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1290.2s)]
*  And I'm just like, yo, be careful. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1293.48s)]
*  He didn't look the same. I don't know when the injury was. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1296.48s)]
*  But can Indiana beat them with a compromised Halliburton? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1298.56s)]
*  I would say no way. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1302.08s)]
*  They can't beat them without Halliburton being solid. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1303.84s)]
*  The one thing I will say is Halliburton is never going to be that guy that gives you 30. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1306.48s)]
*  It's just not in his DNA. He can at times. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1312.24s)]
*  But what Halliburton does is so underrated to me, Bill, because he plays the right way. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1315.9199999999998s)]
*  There was in game three, I think it was game three, whatever game, game four, the game they won. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1323.76s)]
*  So game three, Halliburton made back to back threes, I think. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1331.76s)]
*  And the ball swung to him. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1335.52s)]
*  And 90% of the league would have taken the shot. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  Heat check, heat check. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1340.8s)]
*  And he pump faked, drove to the basket, and he got Sal Kama wide open shot. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1342.48s)]
*  And that's who he is. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1348.48s)]
*  He wants to make plays. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1350.96s)]
*  That's why Indiana plays right, because their best player always plays right. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1352.16s)]
*  The problem with that is now you're in the finals and there's a microscope on you to score. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1357.92s)]
*  That's not what he is. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1363.2s)]
*  You know, he can score and there's going to be games that he has big games. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1364.4s)]
*  But what he can do is run a basketball team. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1369.92s)]
*  And that's why Indiana is where they're at, is because the way Halliburton plays. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1372.88s)]
*  Yeah, I've been saying that on my podcast for the whole finals that when people are like, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1377.9199999999998s)]
*  he's got to step up. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1383.6s)]
*  They need him to score more. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1384.4799999999998s)]
*  I'm just like, that's just a fundamental misunderstanding of who he is. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1385.84s)]
*  We, Steve Nash, you coach Chris Paul, Chris Paul didn't want to score 35 points in a finals game. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1389.04s)]
*  He wanted to have 20 and 12 or 18 and 14. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1398.32s)]
*  If Chris Paul was taking 20 to 25 shots in a game, odds are it was going badly for you, right? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1399.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1405.4399999999998s)]
*  Even magic. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1405.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, Magic Johnson, I mean, Magic could score. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  And when, when, you know, the difference was when he wanted to score, he could just score, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1410.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, he's just bigger than everybody. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1414.96s)]
*  But at the end of the day, yeah, at the end of the day, you know, the games, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1416.56s)]
*  game six, Philadelphia, his rookie year, he proved, yeah, I can score when I need to. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  But what he wanted to do is, is, is make everybody on his team better. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1425.6s)]
*  And he did that. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1429.36s)]
*  And that's why they won. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1430.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1431.44s)]
*  So I don't know when people criticize him for the scoring, I'm like, all right. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1432.24s)]
*  But, but he, uh, I don't think he had the same explosiveness. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1436.16s)]
*  And, you know, this is one of the things I want to think he's headed for two games. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1440.16s)]
*  I think it's, I don't think this injury happened tonight. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1443.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1447.2s)]
*  I think this has been going on for at least two games now. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1448.16s)]
*  Well, this is one of the things I wanted to ask you because you played in the 80s and 90s. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  And obviously there's more, there's definitely more running. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1456.0800000000002s)]
*  The defense is a little fiercer now. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1459.1200000000001s)]
*  You've got more ground to cover. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1460.88s)]
*  And some of these games, like I was just in disbelief in game three and four, just being [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1462.96s)]
*  there, how hard everyone plays for two and a half hours and how fast everyone's going. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1468.72s)]
*  And is, is basketball becoming unsustainable at the speed we're playing it? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1474.72s)]
*  Are we, are we actually putting too much on these dudes? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1479.6s)]
*  Cause when you watch it, it's like, I don't understand how they're, how these guys are [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1482.96s)]
*  upright after two hours. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, when you're watching it, just as a coach, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1488.96s)]
*  No, but you do remember in the seventies, every team shot a hundred shots. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1492.48s)]
*  Both teams always got a hundred field goals a night. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1496.96s)]
*  Now there was no three point line and people took shots quicker. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1500.6399999999999s)]
*  So the game was at a faster pace. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1504.0s)]
*  And then when the three point line came in, shooting percentages plummeted, scoring plummeted. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1505.9199999999998s)]
*  And that was kind of caught back up. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1512.8s)]
*  It's the seventies with a three point line. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1514.8799999999999s)]
*  That's basically what has happened now. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1517.28s)]
*  But do you feel like it's as physical as the seventies though? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1518.96s)]
*  Uh, no, but I do think one thing I love what the league did mid season last year, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1522.6399999999999s)]
*  physicality is back. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1528.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not what it was. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1530.8s)]
*  Because I do think, and that's just hard for me to say, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1533.28s)]
*  there was a line that was crossed at some point where the gang got so physical, it became ugly. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1536.48s)]
*  Um, but I love how they, they're officiating the games. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1542.72s)]
*  Uh, I get so upset when there's a tacky file that they don't call, uh, that they call. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1547.28s)]
*  Like the two flagrants in the game, game four or game three were ridiculous. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1552.08s)]
*  You know, um, I didn't like either one of them. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh, but other than that, so the game is more physical, uh, that like the seventies, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1559.6799999999998s)]
*  the pace is faster, the athletes are bigger and faster. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1566.1599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, Bill, you can make a case. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1569.52s)]
*  Can every team sustain the speed and the pace that the Pacers in Oklahoma are playing at? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1571.28s)]
*  I guess the other argument to that is yes, because Oklahoma's done it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1578.32s)]
*  They're healthy. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1582.08s)]
*  Indiana has done it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1583.1999999999998s)]
*  Indiana had a ton of injuries all year, but they're healthy. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1584.48s)]
*  They're one of the healthier teams in the VA right now. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1587.84s)]
*  These two teams that are playing and probably because to me, they did play at this pace all [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1590.0s)]
*  year, you know, they, they didn't decondition when the season starts. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1594.8s)]
*  And I think that happens a lot in our league because we start resting. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1599.1999999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of guys decondition when the season is starting. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1602.48s)]
*  Uh, and, and they're not ramped up right. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1607.6799999999998s)]
*  The one of the things a lot of teams are going to now we're starting to ramp up for the playoffs. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1610.64s)]
*  That's what we should have been doing for the last six or seven years. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  And we got away from that. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1618.88s)]
*  And I think it's important. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1619.92s)]
*  You know, when you came back to coaching last year, you broke my heart and you left the podcast. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1621.92s)]
*  Um, you, one of the things you were telling me was, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1627.1200000000001s)]
*  one of the things you were telling me was, uh, this Indiana is no joke. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1632.4s)]
*  Like the way they pressure the ball, the pace that they play with, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1636.96s)]
*  I'm kind of shocked, like how effective it is. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1640.64s)]
*  Um, I like, especially like how they go 94 feet against the other teams guards. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1644.0s)]
*  And you were like, I don't think people realize how hard it is to play them. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  And then of course they made the Eastern finals last year, but it seemed like you were, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1653.0400000000002s)]
*  they were on your radar basically the whole time you're the bucks go. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1658.0s)]
*  And then of course you played them in the playoffs. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1660.48s)]
*  You don't have Dame. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1662.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1663.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1664.72s)]
*  But honestly, Bill, we played them the one time and I came away from that game. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1664.88s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1669.84s)]
*  I called, I can say, I'll talk to still probably way too much. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1670.24s)]
*  Uh, and I said, Sammy, you guys don't want to see Indiana. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1675.4399999999998s)]
*  They, they are, they will wear you out. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1679.6799999999998s)]
*  And even if you win the series, you may not have anything left to beat the next team. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1682.1599999999999s)]
*  That's just how they play. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1686.9599999999998s)]
*  Um, and you know, one thing we could do to eliminate it a little bit this year, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1688.56s)]
*  playoffs is we have Yanis and is nobody is going to pressure Yanis [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1695.28s)]
*  or pick them up. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1699.68s)]
*  So we had kind of a free pass against them this year. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1700.24s)]
*  Last year we didn't have Yanis and now, you know, Dame and the guards, they were worn out. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1703.68s)]
*  Now they've been played but two games, but they wore our guards down and you saw them [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1709.04s)]
*  do it against New York. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1713.04s)]
*  You saw them do it again this year. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1714.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, Jalen Bronson, uh, looked exhausted at the end of that, uh, series this year. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1715.68s)]
*  And that's like, you look at Shaya times now, you know, there's points in the game. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1721.2s)]
*  Uh, they've already had to change their substitution pattern. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1727.5200000000002s)]
*  Oklahoma has so they can have a shape fresh at the end of the games. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1730.16s)]
*  That's all from that constant pressure and they're relentless with it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1734.0800000000002s)]
*  They don't let up ever. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1738.4s)]
*  And it's rough. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1740.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1741.2800000000002s)]
*  I noticed that game four, there was a moment in that game where SGA looked like kind of [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1742.0800000000002s)]
*  like spent and he was able to get the second wind and come back in the fourth quarter. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1747.7600000000002s)]
*  But that was the, that was the only time I really thought Indiana was, had a chance to [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1752.4s)]
*  actually win the title was during that third quarter. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1756.48s)]
*  It was mostly because of how shade just looked like a boxer who was like, oh shit, I got [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1758.8s)]
*  three rounds left. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1763.92s)]
*  He said that vibe to him, but he figured it out. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1764.72s)]
*  It's funny you said that I'm watching the game with Austin and Seth. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1767.6s)]
*  And Austin looked at seven and says, oh my God, Indiana is about to win the world [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1771.84s)]
*  championship. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, and that's how you felt in the middle of that third quarter. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1778.64s)]
*  And then Oklahoma took that away. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1782.4s)]
*  You got to give Mark a lot of credit though, because Mark does not change his rotations [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1784.32s)]
*  very often. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1788.8s)]
*  And he did in that game, uh, and he rested shade, if you remember the beginning of the [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1789.68s)]
*  fourth and then took them out one more time. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, and I thought that was, that was huge for shade and Oklahoma to win that game was [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1798.08s)]
*  that little bit of rest. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1804.0s)]
*  Did you think Indiana was this good or did they go up a level as this round, as these [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1805.6s)]
*  four rounds went along? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1811.2s)]
*  Did they, did they kind of push their ceiling up a couple of floors? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1812.48s)]
*  I've always said this bill and the only people that can understand this is people who have [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1816.64s)]
*  gone all the way to the finals. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1822.16s)]
*  If you look, if you ask every coach that has ever been in the finals about their team at [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1825.04s)]
*  the finals, and when they started the playoffs, they will tell you we were a different team [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1830.4s)]
*  by the time we got to the finals. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1835.3600000000001s)]
*  You grow so much, you grow each round. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1837.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh, you find things about your team as a coach, the players find things about themselves. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1840.72s)]
*  Each round teams get closer and closer. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1847.76s)]
*  I always say the first round, every player is still trying to show everybody that they [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1851.2s)]
*  can play. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1854.88s)]
*  They're still worried about half the teams that aren't, you know, the main teams are [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1855.76s)]
*  worried about contract and all the BS they shouldn't be worried about. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1859.6000000000001s)]
*  Then they win that round and all of a sudden teams get a little closer. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  Then they get through that round and they get to the East and the Western finals. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1867.76s)]
*  You are a completely different team. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1871.12s)]
*  And then when you win that round, you go to a level where there's no more eye. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1873.52s)]
*  You never hear about selfish. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1879.76s)]
*  How often do you hear about selfish play in the finals? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1881.52s)]
*  You just don't see it very often. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1884.48s)]
*  And I really believe each team grows. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1886.48s)]
*  Indiana was good. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1889.04s)]
*  They were playing great coming into the playoffs. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1890.3999999999999s)]
*  They beat us. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1893.36s)]
*  They beat Cleveland. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1895.04s)]
*  And they jumped on Cleveland. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1896.64s)]
*  They beat the Knicks. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  And if you ask Rick Carlisle right now, he would tell you, I believed in this team, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1900.72s)]
*  but we're way better now than we were in the first round. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's what happens. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1909.0400000000002s)]
*  You keep growing. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1909.92s)]
*  That's why when you have a team, even like us, you know, Dame, I just kept looking at [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1910.8000000000002s)]
*  our team. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1915.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think a lot of coaches believe, and I know that because I've been there twice [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1916.0s)]
*  in the finals. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1920.16s)]
*  I'm looking at our team and I'm looking at like Gary Trent, AJ Green and all those [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1921.5200000000002s)]
*  guys. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1925.6s)]
*  I'm like, man, each round, if we can get these guys, they're just going to keep [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1926.0s)]
*  getting better and better and better. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1929.9199999999998s)]
*  And then what happens, they bring that back next year. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1932.1599999999999s)]
*  You bring all the ATOs back next year. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1936.0s)]
*  You don't have to waste half your training camp putting in new stuff. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1938.6399999999999s)]
*  You've already done it throughout the playoffs and you jump and it gives you a [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1942.56s)]
*  head start. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1947.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1947.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's where Indiana is at. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1949.52s)]
*  And that's where Oklahoma is at now. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1950.8s)]
*  And that's where some of the teams that didn't make it, there was some hump that [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1953.1200000000001s)]
*  they didn't get over. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1957.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1958.4s)]
*  I mean, you weren't surprised by the Indiana Cleveland series. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1958.64s)]
*  I'm part of it was Garland was hurt, but you thought you just thought that was a [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1962.72s)]
*  scary matchup for Cleveland. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  But even you couldn't even you couldn't have thought Indiana was going to do that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  though. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1972.8000000000002s)]
*  No, I did. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1974.0800000000002s)]
*  I said it out loud that Indiana was going to win that series because I thought [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1975.28s)]
*  their guard pressure. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1979.1200000000001s)]
*  They're one of the few teams that can match up to the Cleveland guards. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1980.6399999999999s)]
*  But then Cleveland had major injuries coming into that. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  When they said guys in game one and two, I said, this series is over. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1987.9199999999998s)]
*  The one thing you can't have in the playoffs, your key guys can't be hurt. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1991.9199999999998s)]
*  You have to be healthy to win. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1996.08s)]
*  You're not winning anything in the NBA playoffs. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=1997.6799999999998s)]
*  You mean like when you didn't have Kevin Garnett in 2009 and when he got hurt [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2002.0s)]
*  with two games left in the season. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2006.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2007.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2007.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2008.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2008.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2009.36s)]
*  It's hard to win. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2009.86s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2010.6s)]
*  I vaguely remember that. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2012.36s)]
*  This whole superstar, you know, like this 24 seven sports discourse. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2015.8799999999999s)]
*  And we talk about superstars and like, I think Hal Bern's a superstar, but he [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2020.52s)]
*  doesn't have the stats that show is a superstar. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2024.6s)]
*  But you made the key point earlier that you can build a team around what he does. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2028.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2033.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2034.12s)]
*  Isn't that the definition of a superstar? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2034.6799999999998s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2036.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know what a superstar is anymore. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2038.1200000000001s)]
*  That would be my definition. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2042.0400000000002s)]
*  Anybody that can make their team a championship level team should be considered a superstar. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2043.96s)]
*  You know, I use this and I've said this a million times. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2052.44s)]
*  I'm sure I've said it on the pod before. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2055.2400000000002s)]
*  One of the most meaningful things that have ever been told to me is by Bill Russell. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2057.8s)]
*  When I brought him in to talk to the team and then he went back in the office. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2062.6s)]
*  He was talking, I think it was to me and Kevin. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2066.92s)]
*  And he said, if I'm the only one that can be great, our team can never be great. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2070.28s)]
*  But if I can be great and give everybody on my team room to be great as well, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2076.04s)]
*  we will be a dominant team. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2081.16s)]
*  And that's what I did. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2082.84s)]
*  That's to me, there's a lot of guys, you know, you can make the case. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2085.48s)]
*  There's a lot of guys. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2088.84s)]
*  If you just told them to shoot every time, pass when they wanted to, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2089.64s)]
*  they're going to have all the stats, but they're the only ones [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2094.04s)]
*  that can be good on their team. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2096.76s)]
*  And that has never worked in the history of the game. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2098.44s)]
*  That has never worked. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2101.96s)]
*  You have to give yourself to the team at some point to win. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2104.84s)]
*  And, you know, Halliburton has done that. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2109.5600000000004s)]
*  And when your best player does it, Bill, it's easy to coach. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2112.36s)]
*  Everybody else falls in line because you can't say he won't do it because he will do it. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2116.0400000000004s)]
*  And it makes it easier for coaches for sure. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2121.8s)]
*  Yeah, I heard I was driving home today. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2124.6000000000004s)]
*  I was listening to Justin and Eddie on Sirius MBA. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2126.28s)]
*  They had Isaiah Hartenstein on and they were asking him about, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2129.4s)]
*  Hey, your role was this way the first couple of rounds in the finals. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2132.84s)]
*  They haven't been using you as much. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2135.96s)]
*  And like, like, what is it like to just have your role change like that? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2137.5600000000004s)]
*  And the biggest series of the season. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2141.6400000000003s)]
*  And he's like, Hey, we're just trying to win. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2144.1200000000003s)]
*  And if I completely trust my coach at this point, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2146.44s)]
*  and if he feels like we have better matchups than me, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2149.4s)]
*  then I want our team to win. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2152.52s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2153.8s)]
*  That's the end of the discussion. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2154.84s)]
*  And that's who he is. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2156.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's who he is anyway. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2157.88s)]
*  But it definitely, I think, you know, I always look back when Rick said, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2159.16s)]
*  I can't think of the kid's name when he was in Dallas, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2163.24s)]
*  but he did it in the finals. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2167.08s)]
*  He said someone that in the history, he had not been a very easy guy to coach, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2168.84s)]
*  but they had made the finals now. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2174.52s)]
*  And the guy just sat there and he's the happiest guy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2176.44s)]
*  Hey, I'm trying to win now. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2178.84s)]
*  And that's what I'm talking about, about growth. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2181.0s)]
*  It's funny, though, I will say this, and I know we're kind of segueing off [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2184.6s)]
*  when I bring this up. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2188.6s)]
*  It also reminded me when you said they asked Hardenstein that [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2190.2s)]
*  is I've had this thing, and I'm going to bring up Tom Thimidou [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2194.8399999999997s)]
*  that I think no team should ever do. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2200.52s)]
*  When you lose, like in the first or second or third round, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2202.2799999999997s)]
*  to have exit meetings the next day after you lose, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2207.1600000000003s)]
*  because what happens is the Hardenstein conversation comes up, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2212.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, with your front office guys. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2217.4s)]
*  The problem is you just lost in the second round. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2219.2400000000002s)]
*  Then that is happy. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2221.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2223.88s)]
*  And then when they say, you know, tell me about the coach. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2225.1600000000003s)]
*  There's going to be about four or five guys that really love you [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2230.44s)]
*  because you showed them love and you played them more. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2232.6000000000004s)]
*  But there's going to be four or five guys who were on your side [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2235.4s)]
*  that may no longer be on your side when those meetings happen. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2239.4s)]
*  And I've long said exit meetings need a month before we have them. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2242.12s)]
*  Because when you have them the next day, the coach is in trouble. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2247.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2251.64s)]
*  And, you know, I will say, Tibbs and I did talk after he was fired, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2252.12s)]
*  and that absolutely came up. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2257.64s)]
*  Like, it couldn't have been anything good that came out of those meetings. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2259.24s)]
*  And so it's interesting. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2263.48s)]
*  We're talking about Hardenstein now in the finals. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2264.92s)]
*  Coach can do anything. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2268.44s)]
*  You know, you remember in 2010, I think we're in the Eastern Finals. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2269.48s)]
*  I think I played Nate and Baby to finish the game, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2274.76s)]
*  and I didn't bring Kevin and those guys back in. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2277.1600000000003s)]
*  We won the game and no one cared because we were trying to win. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2279.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, but when it happens earlier and you lose, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2283.1600000000003s)]
*  guys don't handle that as well as they do when you get to the finals. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2287.48s)]
*  So you're saying maybe the Knicks shouldn't have fired Tom Thibodeau after he made the final four? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2290.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2294.2s)]
*  And won 10 Clavkins? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2294.68s)]
*  Obviously, you know, he only worked for me for a long time. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2296.68s)]
*  So that one, that, you know, it's funny. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2299.56s)]
*  It stings you just as much, not as much as it stung Tibbs, but, you know, firing is hard. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2301.96s)]
*  I've been fired three times. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2307.64s)]
*  And, you know, and when it happens, you know, especially when it happens to one of your guys, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2308.84s)]
*  you know, my guys are Tibbs, Ty Lue. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2314.2s)]
*  When it happens, these guys, you know, they're going to be like, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2316.28s)]
*  when it happens to guys like that, it really bothers you because you know what they are. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2319.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, both of them are just unbelievable coaches. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2325.0s)]
*  And I always use the Utah model. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2327.56s)]
*  The reason Utah stayed good for so long, they never panicked. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2330.52s)]
*  They didn't fire Jerry Sloan because he couldn't get to the finals. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2334.92s)]
*  They knew he could coach. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2337.96s)]
*  There's certain franchise, Boston really, for the most part, the Celtics, they don't make [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2339.08s)]
*  changes once they think they have the right coach, a good coach. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2343.24s)]
*  They're right because they know they can scout better. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2346.9199999999996s)]
*  They can draft better. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2349.64s)]
*  They can make trades better because they know exactly what they're looking for. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2351.56s)]
*  And, you know, I thought the Knicks were on their way to that and now Tibbs is gone. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2355.24s)]
*  Well, you, I mean, you're one of the leaders of the coaching contingent. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2360.9199999999996s)]
*  It's a league now that I think the five longest tenured coaches, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2365.08s)]
*  three of them got the job in 2020. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2369.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2372.2799999999997s)]
*  And then you have Spoh and you have Steve Kerr, the other two. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2372.6s)]
*  And at this point, you're probably in the top 10 longest tenured coaches. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2375.7999999999997s)]
*  Tell me I was 12. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2381.3199999999997s)]
*  Someone told me I was 12, which when you think about it, that's insane. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2383.16s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  But here's the question, because you know that, uh, you know, it's only going to get worse. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2389.96s)]
*  The salaries are going to go up, right? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2396.92s)]
*  We're going to have this, this, whatever happens as the media rights money keeps [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2399.96s)]
*  coming in and we're going to have guys making 60, 65, 70 million a year. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2404.92s)]
*  If they don't like their coach, who's going to win that one? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2411.88s)]
*  It's, it's not going to be the coach. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2414.12s)]
*  It always should be the coach. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2416.28s)]
*  You know, um, I tell coaches that, uh, you know, when I speak and I'm speaking at a [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2417.88s)]
*  coaching clinic in Vegas, uh, I'm the first one to tell them like, listen, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2423.7200000000003s)]
*  our job is to win period. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2428.28s)]
*  Our job is to make players better. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2430.36s)]
*  But at the end of the day, even if you do that, uh, you're still going to get fired [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2432.52s)]
*  sometimes and it's just part of it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2437.16s)]
*  Um, I mean, I could, I could look at the Philadelphia situation and say, we lost to [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2439.48s)]
*  the Boston Celtics. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2443.4s)]
*  No one picked us to win. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2444.6s)]
*  We took them to seven game. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2445.48s)]
*  Um, no two years before I got there, they got sweat and now we're, we're trying to win [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2447.32s)]
*  Eastern finals, but at the end of the day, you're not going to treat players away. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2453.08s)]
*  Uh, if it comes down to that, it's always going to be the coach. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2459.48s)]
*  And that's just the way it is. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2462.44s)]
*  And I tell them like, even Tim's, you know, Tim's a big boy. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2463.8s)]
*  He got it. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2466.84s)]
*  Like, you know, it's not like you're going to hear him gripe about it or anything like [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2467.48s)]
*  that. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2471.56s)]
*  Uh, it's not fair, but it's part of our job and we have to understand that that's a [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2472.28s)]
*  tough part of the NBA. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2477.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2479.16s)]
*  And it might be a five year job at this point. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2479.4s)]
*  And if you last longer than four to five years, it's, it's a borderline miracle. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2481.64s)]
*  We got to take one more break. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2485.48s)]
*  And then I want to talk about SGA. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2486.52s)]
*  Click. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2487.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2488.04s)]
*  So when you first started coming on this podcast a couple of years ago, I remember [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2488.28s)]
*  we had a long conversation about SGA. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2491.24s)]
*  What did you see when, you know, when you coached him on the Quippers, when he was [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2493.4799999999996s)]
*  a young pup, they trade them. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2496.6s)]
*  You make the point, Hey, this guy's going to be really good. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2499.24s)]
*  I wouldn't put them in the trade. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2502.52s)]
*  They have to do it because it's their chance to get quiet. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2503.64s)]
*  And Paul George made them one of the favorites. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2505.7999999999997s)]
*  They throw in a bunch of picks. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2507.7999999999997s)]
*  And then when we talked about this two years ago, this is when he was becoming [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2509.9599999999996s)]
*  a 30 point score. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2513.08s)]
*  He was clearly a special players, be first team on VA. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2514.7599999999998s)]
*  But then this year it goes up a level. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2518.3599999999997s)]
*  And now he's having one of the best start to finish guard seasons in the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2521.24s)]
*  history of the position, you know, it's been steady. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2525.0s)]
*  It's been consistent. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2529.8799999999997s)]
*  The team really takes on his personality. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2531.4799999999996s)]
*  It's really interesting to watch in person. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2533.7999999999997s)]
*  It's just their bench. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2535.4799999999996s)]
*  It's all of these quiet assassins. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2536.68s)]
*  He's a quiet assassin. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2538.7599999999998s)]
*  Even he barely even talks to the refs. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2540.12s)]
*  She kind of does his job. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2542.68s)]
*  It doesn't talk shit to the other players. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2543.9599999999996s)]
*  He just goes, goes, goes. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2546.12s)]
*  And technically, his footwork, his shots like that shot you mentioned earlier [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2547.88s)]
*  when he just had McConnell, McConnell, McConnell, then he has that little [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2554.76s)]
*  fall away on the foul line on him. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2558.36s)]
*  He's one of the best scoring guards I've ever seen. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2562.2000000000003s)]
*  Did you see this? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2565.6400000000003s)]
*  Because I know you saw greatness in him, but not this. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2566.92s)]
*  I loved him. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2569.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I loved him. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2570.44s)]
*  I told you that. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  I told you that three years ago. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2571.88s)]
*  But I mean, come on. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2574.28s)]
*  I mean, no one saw this. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2575.5600000000004s)]
*  I will say, and we talked about Sam Consell earlier, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2578.04s)]
*  Sam was really high on him and almost devastated when we were going to trade him. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2581.2400000000002s)]
*  I remember us talking that night because I had to make the call. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2589.32s)]
*  I guarantee you, I know I remember it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2593.6400000000003s)]
*  I know where I was at because when the trade finally went down, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2597.7200000000003s)]
*  Lawrence calls me and tells me, Shae's in the trade. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2603.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, it's so funny, Bill. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2607.0s)]
*  I was so happy that we got Kawhi and I was, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2608.92s)]
*  it bothered me to make that call to Shae. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2615.32s)]
*  And I've shared that. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2617.96s)]
*  That was a tough call. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2619.96s)]
*  And he handled it like such a pro, but you also felt that it was like this, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2623.32s)]
*  I'm going to make you pay for this trade. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2631.96s)]
*  That's how you felt. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2636.52s)]
*  I called Sam and Sam had just talked to him as well. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2638.2s)]
*  And Sam says, I tell you, we just gave away an assassin. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2642.68s)]
*  And we better win it because this kid, he's going to come back and haunt all of us. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2647.56s)]
*  And you know, I'm so happy for him, Bill, because he reminds me a lot of Maxie. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2655.56s)]
*  It's funny as a coach, you have some of these young guys that are just sponges. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2660.84s)]
*  He never, I coach Shae hard. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2666.44s)]
*  I coach Maxie hard and both of them could take it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2668.68s)]
*  Wanted more. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2674.84s)]
*  They wanted to learn. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2676.12s)]
*  They just both are very similar. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2678.44s)]
*  You think they're these nice guys like Shae, as you said, he comes off as this nice guy. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2681.48s)]
*  Shae's a stone-blooded killer. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2686.36s)]
*  He does not care about making you happy when you get on the floor. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2688.36s)]
*  And he had that when he was a rookie. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2692.6800000000003s)]
*  Now the way he's playing now, I don't think anyone saw that. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2695.1600000000003s)]
*  The footwork and the consistency and how the ball never hits the rim on half of these shots. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2699.8s)]
*  It's just, there's something to hear you about it. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2706.44s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2708.36s)]
*  It's pace. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2710.1200000000003s)]
*  You can't speed them up. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2711.56s)]
*  You're not going to speed them up. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2712.84s)]
*  You're not going to speed them up where he's gotten so much stronger. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2714.3599999999997s)]
*  And to me, his ability, he gets away with that push, but he also gets pushed. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2719.8799999999997s)]
*  And what I'm surprised by, I think Nemhart has done an amazing job and needs to have both. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2725.64s)]
*  Yet Shae's averaging 30. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2732.4399999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2736.9199999999996s)]
*  And they're doing an amazing job defending him. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2737.96s)]
*  His balance is unbelievable. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2741.0s)]
*  As good as any player I've ever seen at being able to take a hit, get his feet, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2743.72s)]
*  and be able to take a shot with rhythm. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2750.7599999999998s)]
*  And he can do it left or right. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2753.24s)]
*  But that was the one thing that stood out his rookie year was his pace. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2756.2799999999997s)]
*  It was obvious. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2762.04s)]
*  Like, man, this guy has an NBA pace and he's never played an NBA game. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2762.9199999999996s)]
*  It's innate. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2766.9199999999996s)]
*  It's in him. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2768.2s)]
*  What he didn't have was the size and physicality. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2769.72s)]
*  And now he has that as well. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2771.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2774.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm trying to think of other guys like that because we talked about this. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2774.6s)]
*  I was going to those games that rookie year, I always thought he was going to be almost [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2777.7999999999997s)]
*  like more of a Nemhart type, like a defense glue guys, fill in the spot, good playmaker. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2781.64s)]
*  But I never saw this going piece. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2787.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2789.8799999999997s)]
*  Footwork guys, Michael had that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2790.2s)]
*  Michael just did it so quick and so athletically. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2792.7599999999998s)]
*  No one ever talked about his footwork. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2797.16s)]
*  Michael's footwork was unbelievable. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2799.08s)]
*  How many times do you see him? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2802.36s)]
*  He gets to his spot, he gets his balance. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2803.56s)]
*  He just did it so quick and so fast that no one really, where she doesn't slower and takes [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2805.88s)]
*  his time. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2811.08s)]
*  No, Paul Pierce is similar in a lot of ways with his footwork and his time. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2811.88s)]
*  And, and, oh, you can go way back to like Kiki Vanderwey's great footwork. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2816.92s)]
*  She has all that. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2821.0s)]
*  But shades, the difference is what you said, his footwork. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2822.2000000000003s)]
*  And then the last thing that he's done two years ago, you could force him to shoot threes. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2825.7200000000003s)]
*  Now he's shooting that at a high clip as well. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2831.64s)]
*  And so that's made him virtually unguardable. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2834.84s)]
*  So what happens in game six, you think? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2838.52s)]
*  Boy, I don't know. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2841.8s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2842.76s)]
*  I think the series may be over because I don't think Halliburton's helped. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2844.12s)]
*  That's why I've landed as well. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2847.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2849.88s)]
*  But if Halliburton can give them a game, you know, I don't know who's going to win this. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2850.36s)]
*  I just, you know what I really want? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2855.2400000000002s)]
*  I really want a game seven. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2856.36s)]
*  You know, I, I love NBA basketball. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2858.04s)]
*  I love the coaching part of it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2862.12s)]
*  I love the playing part of it, but I love watching big games. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2863.48s)]
*  I love watching game sevens. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2866.6s)]
*  And I hope we have one. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2869.0s)]
*  I think it'd be great. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2870.6800000000003s)]
*  I think you would see two young teams. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2872.04s)]
*  And let's say this as well. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2875.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, I guess she is a superstar, right? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2878.44s)]
*  And Halliburton is one. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2880.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2882.2000000000003s)]
*  She is starting to be a household name now. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2883.2400000000002s)]
*  But this is the first series in a long time that we haven't had a series of just [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2886.28s)]
*  at least one or two household names. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2890.44s)]
*  It's been great. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2894.1200000000003s)]
*  It's been great to watch. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2896.28s)]
*  It really has. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2897.6400000000003s)]
*  I think this has been an absolutely fantastic series. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2898.52s)]
*  I think it's been coached great by both coaches, but I think you hit on it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2901.5600000000004s)]
*  And it's what I think that why ratings are up and the fans are enjoying it. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2907.32s)]
*  There's two teams that are playing hard. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2912.28s)]
*  The intensity of these games have been off the chart. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2915.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's great to watch. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2919.4s)]
*  I don't care about the ratings because I feel like this is a one for us finals. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2921.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2925.64s)]
*  It's like for the people who actually like basketball. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2926.04s)]
*  It's not for like my mom where my mom's like, I heard LeBron's in the finals. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2928.6s)]
*  I'll watch like all the casuals are out and this is just the hardcore. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2932.6s)]
*  And by the way, like this has been the league's biggest problem [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2936.92s)]
*  for the entire decade is trying to create new stars, new teams. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2940.6800000000003s)]
*  They put the same guys on, you know, you can see it in Christmas. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2943.64s)]
*  You guys didn't even make Christmas in December with Yanis. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2946.68s)]
*  Which is awful. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2952.2799999999997s)]
*  Great. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2953.64s)]
*  Yanis is one of the people they should be pushing. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2954.2s)]
*  Come on ESPN. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2956.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2958.12s)]
*  But I think, you know, they're creating new teams and new stars, hopefully. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2958.6s)]
*  Did you hear what Magic said on first take? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2965.3199999999997s)]
*  I actually thought this was really smart. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2967.3199999999997s)]
*  He was talking about the dumb face of the league conversation, which I hate. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2969.24s)]
*  But he was saying like the true definition of a superstar is can you sell out an opposing building? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2974.12s)]
*  Are people going to come to see you? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2981.2400000000002s)]
*  And I was like, you know what? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2982.68s)]
*  I think that I think that actually is the definition. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2983.64s)]
*  Can you sell out the other team's building? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2986.84s)]
*  How many guys have done that in the last 40 years? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2988.84s)]
*  It's it's less than 10. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2991.64s)]
*  It's been a lot. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2993.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2994.12s)]
*  I mean, if I let's say I didn't coach in the league and I would just [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2994.52s)]
*  love the ball basketball the way I loved it. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=2998.68s)]
*  I'm going to watch Steph Curry play every day, every chance I get. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3000.6s)]
*  He's going to do something extraordinary. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3005.96s)]
*  He moves without the ball. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3007.72s)]
*  One of my favorite stats in NBA history, in the history of the game was Steph. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3009.72s)]
*  The year Steph won the MVP, the year they won it, his first title. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3016.68s)]
*  He had the ball in his hands 47 percent less than the year before. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3020.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3026.2s)]
*  And that just to me is that, you know, I say this term, our players cringe when I say it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3027.48s)]
*  Like, well, we watch film and I said, all right, guys, the first clip is coaches porn. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3034.28s)]
*  I always call it coaches porn. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3039.64s)]
*  And it usually is some beautiful play. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3041.4s)]
*  And you know, it's funny, like, Yonis and a couple of guys just love it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3045.48s)]
*  They they'll say it now to the bench. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3048.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3050.84s)]
*  Make sure that's on the mural. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3051.08s)]
*  That's coaches porn. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3052.28s)]
*  We're we're Steph has it all the time, you know, so you can watch him play LeBron in his heyday, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3054.04s)]
*  you know, just as passing, you would pay to watch him play Yonis. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3061.08s)]
*  You would pay. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3065.4799999999996s)]
*  You just would go. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3066.3599999999997s)]
*  What is that? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3067.8799999999997s)]
*  What are they going to do tonight? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3068.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, but it's not a long list, you know, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3069.9599999999996s)]
*  I mean, I say Caitlin Clark has it right now. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3074.3599999999997s)]
*  I feel like a WNBA. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3076.52s)]
*  You could say she was out for two weeks and it felt like the league stopped. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3077.7999999999997s)]
*  Listen, Caitlin Clark is Pistol Pete. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3081.0s)]
*  She really is. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3085.0s)]
*  I can watch her. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3085.8s)]
*  You know, it's funny in college, everyone was mesmerized by a shooting. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3087.4s)]
*  I'm like, that's the least of her game. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3091.1600000000003s)]
*  It's her passing. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3093.96s)]
*  And what it's a great example. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3095.48s)]
*  What we talked about with Halliburton is when you watch Caitlin Clark's team play, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3097.6400000000003s)]
*  they run the floor like there's no, you know why? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3103.48s)]
*  Because they know they're going to get the ball. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3105.96s)]
*  They make cuts because they know they're going to get the ball. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3107.8s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3110.44s)]
*  And that's what a superstar does for a team right there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3111.48s)]
*  And yeah, she is an absolute superstar. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3115.6400000000003s)]
*  She may be the biggest superstar in basketball right now or top three. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3119.08s)]
*  At one point today, they ran two straight commercials with her [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3124.76s)]
*  during one of the breaks in the finals game tonight. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3128.1200000000003s)]
*  I was like, she's the right. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3130.84s)]
*  You have a superstar on your team that you guys have been just trying to trade [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3132.84s)]
*  for the last month, apparently by reports. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3136.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3138.44s)]
*  You're just offering Yannis is on eBay now. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3139.88s)]
*  She's just, you know, anyone to make it offer. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3143.32s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3146.52s)]
*  And I've heard all these, you hear all this stuff and no, but you do. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3147.48s)]
*  Don't you don't like it, you know, when you hear it because you know, it's not true. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3151.0s)]
*  Bill and, but it's still like your players here and everybody else hears it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3155.0s)]
*  You know, I remember telling you the story when I was in Boston, I'm on a treadmill working out. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3159.48s)]
*  That's when I could run still, you know, running on a treadmill. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3164.92s)]
*  And they announced that the, the, the Boston Celtics are about to trade Rondo. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3168.44s)]
*  I think he was to the Lakers or someone. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3173.08s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3175.4s)]
*  And it was, it was, it was absurd. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3177.32s)]
*  Like we had never had any conversations, but Rondo heard it, you know? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3179.16s)]
*  And so that's the only thing I don't like about all this. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3185.4s)]
*  Now it's, you know, I don't know how many more times Yannis has to say. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3188.84s)]
*  He wants to be a buck and he wants to win a title with a buck. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3193.96s)]
*  And it's so cool to me, you know, because it's not the way it's done anymore. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3197.56s)]
*  But what a sweet certain guys, you know, I don't think Steph Curry would ever leave [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3204.76s)]
*  Golden State ever. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3208.36s)]
*  And I'm hoping obviously that Yannis is the same way that's the way he's been so far. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3210.6s)]
*  And it's been great. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3214.92s)]
*  It's been awesome. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3215.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3217.32s)]
*  I've been trying to tell people on the pod for the last month that first of all, he doesn't [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3217.56s)]
*  want to leave. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3221.64s)]
*  Second of all, you'd be crazy to trade him when the East is wide open. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3222.28s)]
*  You have the best player in the conference and it just feels like, especially after [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3226.36s)]
*  watching the playoffs this year, it's like, I'm pretty sure I'd want Yannis in the East [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3230.52s)]
*  next year would be, would be my choice. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3234.1200000000003s)]
*  So I said this before the playoffs. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3237.48s)]
*  I said there's never been a better time that I can remember in the NBA that for you to [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3239.1600000000003s)]
*  win a title, meaning anyone. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3246.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3249.4s)]
*  Like 10, 11 teams, if things broke the right way, maybe. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3249.7200000000003s)]
*  If things break the right, there's no dominant team right now. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3253.08s)]
*  Oklahoma may become that if they win, but there's nobody you're scared of in the NBA. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3255.96s)]
*  You know, so right now Orlando makes a huge trade yesterday. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3263.2400000000002s)]
*  There's going to be four or five of those this next year in the East and the West. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3271.48s)]
*  Cause I think, listen, the West, the West gets a lot of love. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3276.52s)]
*  I'm going to just stop there. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3280.44s)]
*  But I don't think there's any team, any East team was scared of a West team. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3281.8799999999997s)]
*  If you know, know what I mean? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3287.96s)]
*  Like, I felt like if we got out of the East, you know, Oklahoma would have been the best [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3289.56s)]
*  team. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3295.48s)]
*  That was the one team you're like, man, they're tough, but I don't think there's a team, you [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3295.8799999999997s)]
*  know, we were worried about Denver, but they let a lot of guys go and they're not the same. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3301.3199999999997s)]
*  There's no dominant team right now. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3307.08s)]
*  But we have one of the dominant players and so we have a shot and so does the Knicks and, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3308.84s)]
*  you know, Boston we'll see by the end of the year if Tatum can come back. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3315.1600000000003s)]
*  I hated that injury. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3318.92s)]
*  I hate that scene. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3320.04s)]
*  But, and then the West too, like, you know, Oklahoma, let's say if they win it, Clippers, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3321.96s)]
*  Denver, Lakers, Minnesota, Golden State has a full year now with Jimmy. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3327.1600000000003s)]
*  It's wide open. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3334.2000000000003s)]
*  The Dame injury among the worst injuries you've, you've from coach, from a coaching [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3336.2s)]
*  standpoint where you know right away and you start doing the math and you're like, oh my [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3343.4s)]
*  God, not only is it for this year, but it could be like a huge part of next year, maybe all [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3349.0s)]
*  next year. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3353.88s)]
*  Do we, is there any chance he comes back? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3354.52s)]
*  You're not, you're staying out of it. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3356.44s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3360.2s)]
*  I'm staying out of it, but I do think, yeah, I think he'll come back by the end of the [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3365.96s)]
*  next season, you know, because he had it early enough in the playoffs. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3369.7200000000003s)]
*  But I got to say this about Dame, Dame had two injuries, you know, you know, I jokingly [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3374.2s)]
*  told Dame, I cried twice for you, damn it, in one year, you know, because when he had [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3380.12s)]
*  the blood clot, you know, there was, there was a moment when I got the news because I'm old [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3387.2400000000002s)]
*  and I know what blood clots usually mean. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3393.0s)]
*  You know, so when I first heard the news, I literally, my eyes watered because I'm thinking [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3396.44s)]
*  this guy's about to get robbed at the rest of his career. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3401.96s)]
*  And then within the next day we find, okay, no, not career threatening. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3405.96s)]
*  He's going to be, he may even come back. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3409.72s)]
*  And then when he went down and I walked out on that floor and the first thing he said to me [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3413.16s)]
*  was, man, I think I sprained my ankle. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3419.16s)]
*  And I was, I didn't say anything, but I was, you know, I was looking at it. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3421.4s)]
*  You know, I, my brain, I was thinking that wasn't an ankle. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3426.44s)]
*  But let's, I remember saying, let's get you in the back. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3430.2000000000003s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3433.48s)]
*  You know, I think Darwin or someone came and grabbed him, but man, you just, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3434.28s)]
*  the guy does everything you ask him to do. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3438.2000000000003s)]
*  He does all the work and then bam, that happens. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3440.28s)]
*  That is part of the game, you know, but that was a rough one for me to see. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3442.92s)]
*  Well, it sounds like, I mean, the one thing from, from talking to you over the last year and a half. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3447.48s)]
*  And so it really seems like you liked the team, like the group of guys, like, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3453.56s)]
*  like you guys had the right vibes and, um, you know, I even thought if you got by Indiana, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3458.6s)]
*  Indiana somehow, like who knows, like you were really optimistic. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3464.6s)]
*  I was surprised. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3469.0s)]
*  I love the group. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3469.56s)]
*  You know, Yanis is one of those like Kevin Garnett superstars that, uh, you can coach [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3470.52s)]
*  him hard, but he's fun to coach. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3476.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying by that? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3479.48s)]
*  Uh, that gave me life a year. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3481.16s)]
*  Uh, I needed that. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3483.96s)]
*  And, uh, like Bobby, we just got a bunch of grownups. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3486.2799999999997s)]
*  I, you know, I keep saying that we got a bunch of grownups and we got the right mix. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3489.96s)]
*  I do believe teams, uh, the old and the new, you need a mix of both. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3494.2s)]
*  I think, uh, Oklahoma adding the Hardenstein's and the Caruso's, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3499.24s)]
*  you know, was huge for them. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3503.24s)]
*  They needed the right, you can, you know, teams make a mistake. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3505.16s)]
*  They go out and just get any that you can't do that. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3508.52s)]
*  You have to get the right vets in Oklahoma did that. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3511.08s)]
*  And you can see that Caruso, uh, game four, you know, we could talk about Shea and all that [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3514.04s)]
*  Caruso won game four for them. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3520.52s)]
*  He's single-handedly willed them to that game. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3523.16s)]
*  And that's that veteran leadership. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3526.44s)]
*  He had won a title before. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3528.3599999999997s)]
*  He knows what it takes. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3529.7999999999997s)]
*  He does all the dirty work. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3531.48s)]
*  Uh, and that's, that's how you feel. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3533.16s)]
*  That's what I like about our team. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3535.3199999999997s)]
*  We have young guys, AJ, Granny, Gary, friends still really young. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3536.52s)]
*  Uh, but then we have older guys. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3540.8399999999997s)]
*  No, I had lunch with Brooke yesterday and, and like, you can't get enough of those guys. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3542.52s)]
*  Now we're in Orlando, so Brooks at Disney, obviously. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3547.24s)]
*  So you could buy it and then you can have lunch with them. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3550.2s)]
*  But, uh, I think that's what makes it. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3556.04s)]
*  Um, I didn't talk, we didn't talk since you had this last season. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3556.9199999999996s)]
*  Was there a player that you went against that you were just shocked by? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3560.2s)]
*  You didn't realize until you were coaching how good somebody was or how good somebody [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3565.3999999999996s)]
*  had the potential to be anybody jump out? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3569.0s)]
*  Brunson. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3572.2799999999997s)]
*  How come? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3574.2s)]
*  Jalen Brunson. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3574.9199999999996s)]
*  I liked him, you know, uh, in Dallas, uh, you know, he played okay against me when he, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3575.7999999999997s)]
*  the first year in Philly. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3585.56s)]
*  But when we played them, when I came, you know, and I'd done a couple of games. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3588.12s)]
*  But when we played them, I think it was at home last year and I was, holy gosh, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3594.52s)]
*  you, you, this guy is, he's good. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3601.88s)]
*  Like he is, he's what his size to be that unstoppable to me is just absolutely unbelievable. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3605.0s)]
*  You worry about his health, uh, because the way he plays, he plays almost, you know, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3614.04s)]
*  running back basketball. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3619.08s)]
*  If you know what I mean, everything's physical, everything's tough, but man, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3620.84s)]
*  it's, he's way better than I thought it was. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3624.2s)]
*  If you were the czar of the NBA, what, was there a rule change you would do? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3627.96s)]
*  Is there anything that drove you crazy as a coach? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3631.56s)]
*  So has the league evolved in a certain way that drives you nuts? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3634.52s)]
*  No, I mean, I like the way the league is evolving right now. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3639.32s)]
*  I really do. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3643.16s)]
*  I like that the game is getting more physical. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3643.7999999999997s)]
*  I hate the fact that I have, if I use a challenge, um, in the first half, only have one left. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3646.2s)]
*  I do think if I win a challenge, I should keep my challenges. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3653.72s)]
*  I don't think I should lose them. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3657.08s)]
*  And the only rule that I would change, um, is at the last play of a game should always [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3658.8399999999997s)]
*  be review whether you have a challenge or not. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3667.08s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3671.3999999999996s)]
*  So somebody makes a shot at the end, but you have no challenge. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3672.8399999999997s)]
*  They just have to do it anyway. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3675.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3678.04s)]
*  Cause you know, I kept thinking that Detroit Nick game, that was clearly a foul [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3678.2s)]
*  and they missed and didn't call it. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3685.56s)]
*  Wouldn't you be sick if that was game seven at NBA finals and you didn't have a challenge? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3688.52s)]
*  That would be, that would be awful. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3695.56s)]
*  So I do think coaches should be able to keep their challenges. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3697.48s)]
*  You know, uh, they get it right. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3701.24s)]
*  They get it right. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3703.0s)]
*  Uh, you should be able to keep it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3704.12s)]
*  And then the last play of the game should just be challenged. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3706.2s)]
*  Uh, if it's close, the ref, the ref should be able to say, I want to take a look. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3710.2799999999997s)]
*  And if they had taken a look in that game, they would have called a foul [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3714.7599999999998s)]
*  and Detroit would have won that game. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3718.8399999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, I do think, um, that's the one play that should just be challenged. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3721.08s)]
*  What happened? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3729.08s)]
*  One more rule. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3729.64s)]
*  One more rule. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3730.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, let's hear it. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3731.16s)]
*  Out of bounds, out of bounds should just be done in Zikakis. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3731.7200000000003s)]
*  We don't need headphones for that. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3735.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3738.92s)]
*  Like just look at it and make the choice. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3739.56s)]
*  That would save us five minutes a game, which Al Michaels tells me all the time. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3741.8s)]
*  You gotta, you gotta speed the end of the games up. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3748.12s)]
*  So that would actually happen. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3751.2400000000002s)]
*  What's the right number of games for the regular season? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3753.64s)]
*  Well, I get into this. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3756.92s)]
*  Just do it. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3758.84s)]
*  70. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3761.64s)]
*  You want 60. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3762.84s)]
*  Yeah, but I'd say 70. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3764.52s)]
*  70 is the perfect number. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3766.28s)]
*  It really is. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3767.96s)]
*  Um, I think you should start the season later. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3769.0s)]
*  You know, I loved it one lockout year, uh, when we started it, that was, I think the [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3773.0s)]
*  first game was Christmas day. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3777.88s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3779.56s)]
*  I would start at December 1st just to get a rhythm. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3780.6800000000003s)]
*  So by Christmas, you know, you can kind of have some big games, uh, but 70. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3783.96s)]
*  And for me, it's been, I've always stayed on 82 bill, uh, because everybody else did [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3789.08s)]
*  it, you know, so you want to say 82, but I do think the more we keep talking about this, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3795.88s)]
*  um, I think at some point we may have to have a serious discussion because no one wants [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3803.08s)]
*  to see the injured basketball. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3808.68s)]
*  We want to see healthy guys play. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3810.44s)]
*  And the facts are guys are getting injured more now and we have to figure that out. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3812.52s)]
*  Especially like lower leg injuries. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3818.6s)]
*  Just feels like there's more than ever. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3820.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, Jason Tatum was too young to have an Achilles. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3823.08s)]
*  Period. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3827.64s)]
*  And so that made no sense to me. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3829.4s)]
*  And so there's something that's going on because there's more Achilles, there's more blood [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3832.04s)]
*  clots, there's something going on and we have to figure it out. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3836.2s)]
*  All right. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3840.2s)]
*  Last question. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3840.52s)]
*  Um, Larry David, his, his next team makes the final four and falls short. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3841.72s)]
*  Um, what was that roller coaster ride like in tax, you know, you weren't in the same [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3847.8s)]
*  spot as he actually had a good next team for months. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3852.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, it was rough for, uh, you know, because he went to that game one. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3856.44s)]
*  Indiana and they left and he left. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3864.36s)]
*  He was supposed to be in the same seats again too, and he couldn't do it. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3868.36s)]
*  It just left the next morning. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3873.0s)]
*  He was gone. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3874.84s)]
*  He left the next morning. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3875.4s)]
*  And so he calls me and says, I'm coming back because I want to play golf with my guys on [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3877.0s)]
*  Sunday. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3881.72s)]
*  I said, you're a freaking liar. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3882.36s)]
*  That is not why you're coming back. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3885.56s)]
*  You're coming back because you're superstitious and you're sitting in game one and they lost. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3887.56s)]
*  And so you're trying to change the mojo. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3892.04s)]
*  And that's Larry one on one. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3895.08s)]
*  He blamed himself for the loss. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3897.16s)]
*  He did. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3899.48s)]
*  He said it was his fault. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3899.88s)]
*  Yeah, he was miserable over that game. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3900.92s)]
*  Uh, and he refused to go in game two because he didn't want each just said, I want no parts [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3904.12s)]
*  of it. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3909.8s)]
*  He's a real fan. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3911.96s)]
*  Like he is into it. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3912.92s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3914.36s)]
*  It was great to have the next fans back. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3915.48s)]
*  All the versions of them with the biggest fan base. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3917.88s)]
*  I mean, you, you played there, you got to see it firsthand, but it's really like the [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3920.52s)]
*  all time craziest fan base when it's going great. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3924.28s)]
*  Their chests are out there. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3927.48s)]
*  Go nuts. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3928.6s)]
*  As soon as it goes bad, they are the most despondent fan base you're ever going to have. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3929.16s)]
*  They was the Gambit of immersion. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3933.72s)]
*  Go New York, go. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3935.08s)]
*  You know, I, I was at Nick and we had that run and that song, go New York, go. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3935.96s)]
*  The city was on fire. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3941.56s)]
*  It really was. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3943.32s)]
*  And that's how you felt this year, you know, uh, and I do think, you know, Dolan gets a [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3944.04s)]
*  lot of heat, but I don't know who's doing it, but whoever thought of bringing all the [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3949.4s)]
*  ex Nick's back to games. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3953.72s)]
*  That was a genius move. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3956.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was awesome. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3957.72s)]
*  It was really awesome. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3958.92s)]
*  Uh, we need one more guy to show up and then it's all done. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3959.88s)]
*  Oakley and good luck there. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3963.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's it was, it was, that's like, you might have to broker that [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3967.4s)]
*  one doc. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3970.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3971.88s)]
*  So you have no, thank you. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3972.2s)]
*  So you're in Orlando, you're set. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3974.04s)]
*  You're going to celebrate the commissioner's cup and Seth Curry's, uh, three point percentage [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3976.12s)]
*  title. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3980.76s)]
*  How about that? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3981.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3982.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3983.32s)]
*  No, no facts. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3983.64s)]
*  Seth Curry, 46%, 49%, whatever it was led the league. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3985.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3988.92s)]
*  We have trophies at the river's house right now. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3989.08s)]
*  You know, we, we have some hardware from regular season. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3990.92s)]
*  So how do we get him to Denver? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3993.4s)]
*  I actually think the perfect place for him would be golden state. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=3996.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, is that possible? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4001.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know if it's possible or not. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4003.64s)]
*  I don't know if either one of them would want it actually, but I do think forget that [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4005.32s)]
*  it has nothing to do with that. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4010.44s)]
*  It's the way they play. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4012.76s)]
*  He fits perfect. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4015.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4016.84s)]
*  You know, and I've said that for two or three years and whenever you bring it up in the [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4017.1600000000003s)]
*  family, they kind of, uh, but I do think it'd be sensational. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4021.72s)]
*  It'd be great for us to ask you actually, do you think more teams are going to emulate [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4026.9199999999996s)]
*  this? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4030.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4030.8399999999997s)]
*  See Indiana fast pace. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4031.24s)]
*  Nobody has the ball for too long. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4033.48s)]
*  People keep cutting and moving. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4035.24s)]
*  Is this going to be like a copycat thing with that? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4036.6s)]
*  Well, everything in our league is copycat a little bit, as you know. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4041.0s)]
*  I do think not exactly the way they play, but I do think because of collective bargaining, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4044.8399999999997s)]
*  I think teams are starting to see trying to have the loaded three star team doesn't work [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4052.2s)]
*  anymore. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4057.16s)]
*  So I do think you have two teams now that you can make a case. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4058.52s)]
*  There's a superstar and then there's really, really, really good player. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4063.0s)]
*  And then a lot of good players. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4067.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that's the model you're going to see. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4068.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know if everyone's going to adopt the same style, but I do think that's what [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4070.52s)]
*  you're going to start seeing is that model of team. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4074.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4076.9199999999996s)]
*  Not every team can do it, but it would have to be a team that has a bunch of guards. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4077.24s)]
*  And is unselfish, but I don't know. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4082.2799999999997s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4084.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4086.2799999999997s)]
*  Doc Rivers, it was great to see you. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4087.0s)]
*  I'll see you in LA. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4089.24s)]
*  I know. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4091.08s)]
*  People walk on the street and say, hey, give up this coaching. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4091.24s)]
*  Get back to the podcast. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4095.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4096.76s)]
*  People love the pods. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4097.08s)]
*  We'll get back at some point. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4099.88s)]
*  For sure. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4101.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4101.48s)]
*  I'll see you in LA, but say hi to the Curry family and the Rivers family and all the family [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4101.5599999999995s)]
*  members. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4107.0s)]
*  But it was great to see you. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4107.32s)]
*  Thanks for doing this with us. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4108.2s)]
*  Good seeing you. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3GQOnVk-5k&t=4109.4s)]
