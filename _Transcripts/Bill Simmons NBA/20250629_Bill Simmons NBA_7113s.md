# The NBA Summer Movement Preview With Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=0.0s)]
*  5 30 PM Pacific time on a Sunday night. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=26.12s)]
*  You know, in years past, and we've been doing this since I think 2018 [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  range, and there was always something either a massive event, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=33.68s)]
*  Marcello or like something we didn't expect right around, like in that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=38.12s)]
*  36 hour stretch before July 1st. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=42.76s)]
*  I don't think the Jabari Smith extension has really qualified for me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=46.04s)]
*  I don't know if you feel differently. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=49.92s)]
*  Uh, it's just, nothing's really happening yet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=51.4s)]
*  And yet there are all these moving pieces right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Um, and I was just going to throw a bunch of stuff that I'm fascinated [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  by so far since the finals event. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=62.04s)]
*  And I'll start here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=64.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=65.6s)]
*  I really like everything Houston's doing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=65.92s)]
*  It's getting a 10 out of a 10 approval rating for me from the Durant [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=69.2s)]
*  trade, which we've already talked about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=72.8s)]
*  They signed Jabari Smith today to a five year, 122 million dollar extension. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=74.28s)]
*  They renegotiated with Van Vliet, got him at 25 years, 25 million [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=79.36s)]
*  for two years each year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  Uh, and I just like the roster they put together. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=86.4s)]
*  It makes sense to me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=90.32s)]
*  I'm not sure they need to do anything else. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=91.32s)]
*  And I think they're a real threat in the West now and they have stability and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=93.08s)]
*  assets. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=98.2s)]
*  I think they have flexibility to do more stuff in December, January, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  February, if they need to. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  And I think they're in the mix. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=104.2s)]
*  I really do. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=105.44s)]
*  What did you take on the Raggots? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  Love what they've done. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=108.2s)]
*  I think we've kind of touched on just a bunch of the things, even going back to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=109.16s)]
*  like last year where they were one of the rare teams that spends a top pick on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  Jaylen Green and then just doesn't give them the full max because he scored a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=117.48s)]
*  million points. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=120.48s)]
*  You know, they structured that deal in a way where it was like, we like you, but [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  we're still not sure. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=124.56s)]
*  And so I think that showed you the rare, I want to get into some of these other [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=126.0s)]
*  deals where it feels like the overriding sentiment the last couple of days has [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=132.6s)]
*  just been teams doing players favors, but they've been really just smart and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=135.68s)]
*  calculated about it all. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=141.4s)]
*  Like when the Van Vliet signing happened, you looked at the total numbers, you're [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=142.44s)]
*  like, well, that's nuts. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=145.16s)]
*  And it's like, what are they going to do with that player option? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=146.16s)]
*  Well, or excuse me, the team option. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=148.0s)]
*  So they declined the team option because it didn't really make a ton of sense. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=149.96s)]
*  If Van Vliet was going to make 45 million for one year, they do the new deal. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=153.24s)]
*  Two years, 25 million. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's a win for them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=157.52s)]
*  Probably a little more stability. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=158.88s)]
*  It's also kind of a win for him too, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=159.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=161.44s)]
*  Because they were going to decline the option and now he's out in the open [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=161.56s)]
*  market and not looking at 45 million anyway. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=164.76s)]
*  25 million would have been the range. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  And even then it was going to be tough to find a landing spot as everybody sits [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=170.56s)]
*  here, every article you read, it's like, other than Brooklyn, other than Brooklyn, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=173.68s)]
*  other than, you know, so some of these numbers, but even the Jabari deal, it's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=176.84s)]
*  five for one 22, but seriously, like he's probably kind of like in a make or break [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=180.64s)]
*  season, but 20 plus million a year for him at this age, knowing that if it doesn't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=184.56s)]
*  work out, you can trade him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=189.36s)]
*  And then I was looking at, this is where it can get a little confusing on like if [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=190.44s)]
*  they do this or they do that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=193.76s)]
*  And, you know, they had to get cute with, with some of the restructuring of how [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=195.48s)]
*  they were working their books, but I think they can still use a full non [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  taxpayer mid level if they want to get greedy for 14.1. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=203.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=208.0s)]
*  So they've positioned themselves really well. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=208.68s)]
*  They'll probably do the Durant extension. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=211.28s)]
*  I'd imagine, which is always going to be a little scary, but hell, I was even [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  like thinking, man, if I'm another team and Jay Sean Tate is available, I loved [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  him when he got minutes and then they find a way to keep him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=220.56s)]
*  So, uh, I'm incredibly impressed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=223.44s)]
*  So I don't even know other than what Stephen Adams three years, 39 million. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=226.6s)]
*  Is there anything to really go like, Whoa, I mean, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=230.08s)]
*  yeah, it was like, if it had been three years, 30, I would have been like, nice deal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=232.68s)]
*  39 was like, ah, a wee bit rich, but you know, splitting hairs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  They're number four on the, uh, on Fandel's champion odds right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=239.6s)]
*  Nine to one. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=243.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=244.52s)]
*  See the favorite Cleveland is six to one. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=244.84s)]
*  Nick's are nine to one and the Rockets are nine to one. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=247.12s)]
*  And I think that's, I think that's fair. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=249.32s)]
*  Minnesota was 14 to one, which I thought Minnesota and Houston would have similar [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=251.68s)]
*  odds, but the better is like, uh, Houston, a little more than Minnesota. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=257.16s)]
*  I mean, and that's the second story that we have to hit that ties in Houston. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  And also ties into the big picture of all of this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=264.92s)]
*  They keep Naz read, which I thought was impossible in February. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=268.04s)]
*  And I didn't realize what was going to happen with the market. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=272.36s)]
*  They kept Naz read that contract next year starts at $21 million. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=274.72s)]
*  He's a $30 million player. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=278.68s)]
*  Like in, in normal times, like basically what this new CBA has done is like when [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=280.72s)]
*  you buy a car, there's like this new car tax that you're basically paying for the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=286.48s)]
*  moment you take the car off the lot. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  The, the number of that car decreases by 25%. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=293.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=296.92s)]
*  You're just basically paying cause you want a new car and NBA free agency [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=297.12s)]
*  has had this forever where it's like, well, Naz read's not worth 160 million for five [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=300.36s)]
*  years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=305.92s)]
*  He's worth probably 120, but now you got to pay the extra 40 million to get Naz read. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  It feels like this new CBA has eliminated the new car tax and Randall is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=310.68s)]
*  a hundred million for three years. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=315.48s)]
*  It's not 125 for three years. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=316.64s)]
*  The last deal that we have that I think teams are a team would regret is that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=319.12s)]
*  Brandon Ingram deal where Toronto trades for him and then gives him, what was it? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=323.0s)]
*  120 for three years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=327.0s)]
*  It's just out of whack. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=329.36s)]
*  He's not, I don't think he, I think he should be in that Randall range. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=330.56s)]
*  So we've seen a resetting and we've seen the smarter teams kind of locked down [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=334.4s)]
*  these contracts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=339.32s)]
*  And I think it's going to be a free for all with these free agents where that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=340.4s)]
*  we're just a bunch of guys who were like, wait, I thought I was worth this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=344.24s)]
*  And say, no, you actually aren't. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=347.6s)]
*  You're actually the numbers have moved down here and that's just the reality of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=349.92s)]
*  it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=353.6s)]
*  This episode is presented by state farm. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=353.68s)]
*  It's no secret that great teams need great teammates. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=356.12s)]
*  I've been saying this for years. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=358.92s)]
*  And when it comes to insurance, I think it's worth it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=360.2s)]
*  I've been saying this for years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=362.44s)]
*  And when it comes to insurance state farm is there to help you find the right [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=363.44s)]
*  coverage for your home car and more, whether you need an in-person or digital [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=366.32s)]
*  assist, they're ready when life hits you with a full court press, get a game plan [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=370.56s)]
*  that helps fit your life. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  Talk to state farm today, state farm with the assist coverage options are selected [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=377.56s)]
*  by the customer availability and the eligibility vary by state. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=382.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=387.32s)]
*  Minnesota is a big part of this because you had to figure with the cat trade [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=387.67999999999995s)]
*  because how big those numbers get at the back end and then Rudy did an extension, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=392.2s)]
*  which was less annually than what he was building towards. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=395.44s)]
*  It was like, okay, they're, they're probably trying to figure out a way to like [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  lock in this number that doesn't prevent, you know, total flexibility here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=403.28s)]
*  Uh, but, but did, but did you think they would be able to keep Randall and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=408.64s)]
*  NAS cause I would have thought that would be impossible in February. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=412.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, who's going to pay NAS more than 25, 30 million a year. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=416.64s)]
*  Nobody, nobody has the space. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=422.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=425.76s)]
*  Like you, I just, maybe I didn't look at it hard enough four months ago, but I [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=426.36s)]
*  just assumed they would be the way the league works where it's like somebody [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=431.64s)]
*  creates space or there's a sign and trade or there's some suitor and it's like, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=434.44s)]
*  Whoa, Indiana is getting Naz read. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=437.52s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=439.12s)]
*  It seems like that era is over. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=440.8s)]
*  Nobody can do it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=442.56s)]
*  Well, I don't know that we're going to have a year where there's one team with [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=444.08s)]
*  major cap space and then nobody else does, but I, I think there was also [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=447.28s)]
*  teams that were like, you know, where do I park my shit? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=451.92s)]
*  Where do I park it? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=458.16s)]
*  Oh, there's, there's nowhere to park it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=459.72s)]
*  I mean, think about like Brooklyn. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=461.8s)]
*  They have their five picks. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  It's like, what are you going to do off from another first to take on a contract? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  And Sean Marks is like, Hey boys, you know, open up the notebooks. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  We got six, the ball handling guard. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=472.24s)]
*  And even then they took on, um, Terrence man's deal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=476.0s)]
*  So there, it's just such a rarity that you really didn't have anybody, especially [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=479.32s)]
*  with the way the Detroit stuff worked out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=484.76s)]
*  Like at one point you thought could Detroit get a $25 million player in there [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  where their cap space, but then Cade gets the bump. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=490.24s)]
*  So then that kind of eliminates that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=492.44s)]
*  So Nas, when I had heard the first like offering like four years for a hundred, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  I just assume whatever number I hear you like tack on a little bit more to it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=499.76s)]
*  So when it came out, I wasn't entirely shocked. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=503.04s)]
*  The Randall one, like I was really looking at it this morning. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=504.88s)]
*  So he goes three years for a hundred ops out of the player option. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  35.8. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=513.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=514.6s)]
*  Now too often I will look at a deal and go, I hate to be in the Randall business [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  for a hundred million dollars, or I'd hate to be like, there's too often. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=521.52s)]
*  I say it with too many players where it's like, Hey dude, like I have to check myself [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  and go, well, at some point you have to sign somebody and you can't just let [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=527.96s)]
*  assets just walk for absolutely nothing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=531.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=533.68s)]
*  But the top 60 guy, you just got to blink and suck it up. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=533.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=537.72s)]
*  And so if you think of Randall's, cause I think there was still a little sticker [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=538.52s)]
*  shock and that's probably just the recency bias of the last series and you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=542.6s)]
*  could say, well, Hey, he was really good in the first two rounds. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=545.6s)]
*  Well, was that potentially the matchups that he was going up against? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=550.28s)]
*  I mean, all that stuff I think is totally fair, but I went back to 2021 where [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  Randall signed a four year deal with the Knicks for 117 million. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=555.84s)]
*  So it is four years, 117 million. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=562.72s)]
*  And that's when the salary cap is at 112 million. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=565.68s)]
*  Well, now the salary caps north of 150 million and you're getting Randall [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=569.04s)]
*  for like, you know, depending on how they stagger with 8% raises over the years. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=572.32s)]
*  It's kind of the same contract. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=577.04s)]
*  And this is somebody four years ago, you were wondering before he was actually, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=578.28s)]
*  excuse me, we were thinking back to last August, if he was going to do a four [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=583.12s)]
*  year, like $184 million extension. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=587.12s)]
*  Like that was one of the things that was on the table. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=590.12s)]
*  Like what if he puts up this huge grant? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=591.68s)]
*  And I don't know what Brunson, he was going to get the same number of touches, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=593.28s)]
*  but you know, three years for a hundred million, even though I don't love the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=596.72s)]
*  guy that kind of puts him in the 70th highest paid player range, that's kind [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  of what he costs. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=606.12s)]
*  This is what's changed though, where it's become a little more like movies. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=607.24s)]
*  The star stars are going to get even more money. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  Like Booker is going to get 75 million a year for two years or three years, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=614.0s)]
*  whatever that extension is. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=618.36s)]
*  That's where. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=619.56s)]
*  Whatever Luca wants to wait for too. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=620.6s)]
*  Luca SGA Tatum already signed the, especially if you have some sort of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=622.68s)]
*  OMBA, you're looking at 65 million and up, but then there's that class right [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=628.04s)]
*  below and we're seeing like some of those Toronto contracts that we're none [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=632.5999999999999s)]
*  of it, neither you or I really liked. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=636.8s)]
*  And you go back and look at some of those deals now, like what quickly [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=639.0799999999999s)]
*  signed for what Ingram signed for. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=641.56s)]
*  And I just don't think, I think those guys would be 20 to $25 million guys [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=643.76s)]
*  and whatever this new version of the market is because we got five years, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=647.5999999999999s)]
*  162 fully guaranteed. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  Which was my thing with Nas read. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like, if, if that's quickly as price, how is Nas read? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=656.36s)]
*  Not a $30 million a year guy, but apparently those days are, those days are over. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=659.48s)]
*  Um, but I looked up some of this other stuff too, like Nick Claxton was four [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=664.12s)]
*  years, 97 million. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=667.7600000000001s)]
*  So like you get sticker shock over Randall and it's like, well, there's way [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=669.2s)]
*  more to Randall than what Nick Claxton is at this point to bias Harris. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=672.84s)]
*  Granted, it was shorter years, but it was two years, 52 million. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=676.7600000000001s)]
*  Cause Detroit was like, we've had him in here before, make some shots. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=680.36s)]
*  John Collins. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=683.04s)]
*  I mean, this deal wasn't 21. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=684.32s)]
*  He did my favorites five years, 125 million fully guaranteed. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=686.64s)]
*  He's making 26 this year. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=692.64s)]
*  Well, that's why Reeves turned down. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  Would Reeves turn down four for 97? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=697.0s)]
*  Cause he's going to, he's one of those guys that actually can get to the five, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=699.12s)]
*  one 50, I think everybody knew that was getting turned down. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=702.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  Even the Lakers were like, we knew he was going to turn it down, but we just [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=706.16s)]
*  wanted to make them know that we were interested. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=709.28s)]
*  But that was like a done deal. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=712.4s)]
*  Cause it doesn't make any sense for him to do it knowing what's coming or he's [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  potentially eligible for, but, um, yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=716.28s)]
*  I mean, when Collins picked up his player option for 26 and a half million, do you [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=719.48s)]
*  know how old Collins is by the way, off the top of your head? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=724.12s)]
*  Isn't he still in his twenties? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=726.8s)]
*  He's 28. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=728.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  He's just, he came in the league pretty early. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=730.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=733.16s)]
*  Cause if you look at the, the, uh, the big free agents that are left, because [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=733.3199999999999s)]
*  everybody basically got locked down and then hardened looked like he did a deal. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=738.36s)]
*  So Kyrie's three for 119 hardens two for 81. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=742.48s)]
*  So for that caliber, it seems like 40 million a year. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=746.84s)]
*  Randall, it seems a little light, but it also seems like he wanted to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=750.6s)]
*  lock down a little long-term security. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=754.0s)]
*  So that Randall range is like 33 to 35 billion a year. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=755.92s)]
*  Then that Naz read range five for 125. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=761.32s)]
*  That's about 25 a year. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=764.32s)]
*  And that seems like that's where that's the hierarchy now. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=765.72s)]
*  So if you have a guy who's not one of the best three players in your team, but [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=768.6s)]
*  it's super valuable, like Naz read it's in the 20 to 25 range, Jabari Smith. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=777.84s)]
*  That's another one. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=778.12s)]
*  I don't know if this is going to lap, by the way, the cap keeps [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=779.12s)]
*  going up 10% of every year. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=781.04s)]
*  So it might, as we keep going, there's more teams with cap space next year. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=782.36s)]
*  There's a bunch of them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=786.36s)]
*  Maybe this will flip, but this was the reality of this year. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=787.84s)]
*  Uh, Davion Mitchell two for 24, which just seems like a normal free agent [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=791.0s)]
*  contract than the other year, but that's probably the price now for a [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=796.36s)]
*  roll guy, 10 million, 12 million, maybe shorter money. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=799.2s)]
*  So when I look at Phinney Smith opting out with the Lakers, which I thought [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=804.28s)]
*  was interesting today and really speaks to the, how weird the Lakers [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=807.64s)]
*  situations right now, but I don't know. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  Is he getting more than that? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=814.12s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=815.12s)]
*  Maybe he'll get more years, but he's looking at that 14.1 million free agent [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=815.8000000000001s)]
*  exception, which half the teams in the league have, and maybe you can add [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=822.28s)]
*  three years to that it's three for 50, something like that, but in the old days, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=826.6s)]
*  he might've gotten like four for 75, like, like some really dopey Max [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=831.76s)]
*  strews, remember that contract? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=836.16s)]
*  I think those contracts are done. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=838.0s)]
*  Max is four for 64. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=840.6s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=842.36s)]
*  It may happen in the way that a team is not worried about the apron. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=844.92s)]
*  They're not worried about the tax and they go to, we don't want to [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=849.8399999999999s)]
*  lose the asset for nothing. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=852.12s)]
*  I mean, I think you're still going to see some of that stuff happen because [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=853.32s)]
*  I think there's another part of this. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=856.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=858.04s)]
*  I'm talking like, yeah. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=858.52s)]
*  I, I just think it's very rare that you have, like it was two [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=861.12s)]
*  forces fighting each other. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=864.92s)]
*  One was one team with cap space that doesn't want to do anything with it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=866.24s)]
*  And then also not a ton of available free agents. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=869.48s)]
*  So I think that there are teams that probably could have held a much harder [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=872.04s)]
*  line if they wanted to be like way hard right now. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=876.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=881.44s)]
*  But think about the hardened deal. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=881.64s)]
*  Like hardened has a player option at 36 and a half million. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=883.5600000000001s)]
*  He signs for two for 81.5 million. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=887.96s)]
*  So he gets a raise of like maybe a couple million for one year. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=892.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you could envision a scenario where the Clippers go, Hey, if you opt [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  out, you really want to go to free agency? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=899.2s)]
*  Well, who's, who's signing you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=902.6s)]
*  So why don't you just pick up the player option and granted all this stuff is [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=904.28s)]
*  worked out ahead of time. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=908.8399999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure they're very happy with how productive he was. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=909.76s)]
*  He was all NBA in a way that he didn't really expect. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=911.64s)]
*  Like this isn't about the playoff part of it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=913.7199999999999s)]
*  Are they happy? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=915.52s)]
*  Well, they gave me one and a half million, so they must feel pretty good about it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=917.5999999999999s)]
*  If we were at dinner with the Clippers people before they agreed to that [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=921.3199999999999s)]
*  contract and wine was going around and it's like 10 30 at night at the table. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=925.04s)]
*  Do you think somebody would have been basically just like, I just got to say [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=932.28s)]
*  this game seven. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=936.68s)]
*  Are we sure we want two more years of this? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=941.64s)]
*  Like there's no way they didn't have that conversation in the room at some point [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=943.64s)]
*  over the last four weeks. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=947.2399999999999s)]
*  Like, are we sure we want to do this? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=948.16s)]
*  So we just talk about game seven again, because I think it's so hard to find [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  guys in the top 50 that you just got to suck it up and you start going glass [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=954.5999999999999s)]
*  half full instead of glass half empty. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=958.68s)]
*  But there had to have been a moment in the last four weeks. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=960.5999999999999s)]
*  Like, like Ty Lute, there's no way he didn't crunch that game seven tape one more [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=962.96s)]
*  time. And just like, my God, he won't fucking look at the rim. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=967.44s)]
*  Like we're going to do this for two more years. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=970.96s)]
*  He won't fucking look at the rim. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=973.0s)]
*  But they did it because they're teams are so scared about not having an asset. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  They'd rather have the asset they're not happy with. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=980.64s)]
*  Like, all right, we'll just get them figured out. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=983.52s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  They said in the open market, what was he going to do? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=987.24s)]
*  Where was he going? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=989.52s)]
*  That's my point is there are multiple examples these last couple of days where a [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=990.36s)]
*  team could have been like, are you want to opt out? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=995.12s)]
*  Like you want to raise from us and you want to throw in another player controlled [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=997.72s)]
*  second year because the 81 and a half, the first year is fully guaranteed. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1001.12s)]
*  The second year is partially guaranteed, but it is a player option. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1004.84s)]
*  So we can be right back to this. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1007.08s)]
*  So he was never opting out. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1008.96s)]
*  Worst case scenario, he's opting in and grabbing that, making sure he gets that [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1011.08s)]
*  one thing. So that was always how this is going to play out. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1015.08s)]
*  And the same thing for Rando. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1017.96s)]
*  I think Rando was ultimately he had to opt in and that's, that's the leverage [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1019.0s)]
*  the team said. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1023.2s)]
*  Now, whether this will be the case in three years from now when the cap is way [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1024.24s)]
*  higher, right. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1027.56s)]
*  And everybody has recalibrated their books to some degree. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1028.92s)]
*  I don't know, but I think this is the, this is the weirdest summer since 2016 [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1032.64s)]
*  for just looking at either in 2016 was the opposite. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1037.12s)]
*  People had so much cap space. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1041.24s)]
*  They were like fucking at the strip joint at three in the morning, just [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1042.76s)]
*  Evan Turner, Lewald Dangle. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1046.56s)]
*  Like that could be like a documentary. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1048.44s)]
*  Think about that summer. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1050.48s)]
*  All those guys made more money than most of the free insists are going to make [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1051.72s)]
*  this summer. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1055.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1056.6s)]
*  And then the players didn't understand for the most part what was going on. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1057.08s)]
*  And then once they realized they were like, Hey, so we were told not softening [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1060.28s)]
*  the cap would be good for us. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1063.96s)]
*  And you know, the way that story goes, the people were trying to explain it to [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1067.0s)]
*  players leadership and players, you know, association was like, absolutely not. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1070.84s)]
*  And, you know, I can understand it too. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1076.0s)]
*  It's like, what does that mean? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1077.32s)]
*  Like, no, we want all of our money and the money that we're just like the way it [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1078.08s)]
*  works is this is how it goes. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1081.1999999999998s)]
*  And then all of a sudden everybody's just flush with cash. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1084.84s)]
*  Like the Evan Turner contract, when that one happened, I just remember thinking [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1085.28s)]
*  like, well, that's wrong. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1088.9599999999998s)]
*  There's, there's no way Evan Turner got set. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1091.56s)]
*  What was it? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1094.48s)]
*  70 million bucks or something. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1094.76s)]
*  I think that was the one I was the most upset about. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1095.9599999999998s)]
*  I think the Noah one was the most shocking one to me. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1098.04s)]
*  Cause they were real signs that he might be headed toward the downside. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1102.52s)]
*  It was like, nobody had watched. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1107.0s)]
*  Watch the, uh, the previous season speaking of cap space. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1109.4s)]
*  This is another story I have my own. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1112.76s)]
*  And this has multiple tentacles to it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1115.96s)]
*  Uh, Detroit now is going to have cap space. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1118.16s)]
*  It looks like, because everyone thought they're going to resign Malik Beasley. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1120.32s)]
*  And apparently they had, uh, it was reported that they were thinking [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1124.8s)]
*  about three years, 42 for them. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1127.56s)]
*  For him. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1129.84s)]
*  And that was going to take them out of free agent cap stuff, right? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1130.6s)]
*  They're probably going to let Schroeder go. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  Tim Hardaway Jr. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1135.8799999999999s)]
*  Who knows, but Beasley, so busy was going to be their free agent. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1136.76s)]
*  Then we get, we wake up this morning and he's in a gambling, uh, being investigated. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  Detroit is backed off of the thing. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  He's now in some sort of, God only knows what's going to happen with that. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  We could talk about that piece later. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  But now Detroit is going to have like 17 million. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  And then if they can trade some contracts or, you know, get somebody to take somebody [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1157.32s)]
*  out, they can probably get to 20, maybe even 25 if somebody took font neck. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1162.0s)]
*  Um, and all of a sudden they're probably the biggest suitor out of all these dudes. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1168.0s)]
*  I don't know if there's anybody left, but, uh, that could be a finished Smith spot. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1177.8s)]
*  I, I think we've talked about in the past, like the East, who knows, indie Boston, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1178.2s)]
*  you know, you, Detroit could have a chance to be like a two or three seed. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1183.8799999999999s)]
*  This is a really big decision for them who they're going to add. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1187.2s)]
*  And there's a lot of guys that I like too. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1189.76s)]
*  So what do they do? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1191.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, how, how many guys do you like? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1193.6s)]
*  How many of you guys do you like that are playing in their playoff rotation that [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1195.2s)]
*  are worth a multi-year investment, knowing that there's other players [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1198.8s)]
*  they're going to have to pay soon? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1201.8799999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1203.28s)]
*  I'll give you some. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1203.56s)]
*  I do like Alexander Walker a lot. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1205.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if he's a top three guy, but I, we watched him play in a [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1209.16s)]
*  playoff series. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1212.24s)]
*  I liked how he played. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1212.88s)]
*  I still like Ty Jerome. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1214.32s)]
*  I'm not going to get thrown off by that weird Indiana series. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1215.52s)]
*  I watched too many games during the season when he was just in credit. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1218.64s)]
*  And I know you're an even bigger fan. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1222.32s)]
*  He was just too impactful off the bench too many times. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1224.04s)]
*  Finney Smith, Yavis Ellie. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1226.8s)]
*  Then it, then it starts getting those. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1232.36s)]
*  Those are probably the top four for me. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1234.52s)]
*  That's why I was surprised that you said you like that many people. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1236.1200000000001s)]
*  There's probably one. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1239.56s)]
*  There's probably a conversation about Jerome allowing K to be off the ball [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1240.68s)]
*  a little bit instead of just having him run high pick and roll, like. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1244.0s)]
*  You know, 90% of the game and providing spacing. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1247.28s)]
*  Cause Kate clearly, I think this one year proved like he would give this [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1251.4s)]
*  guy a little bit of spacing, which you could potentially lose the Beasley [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1253.96s)]
*  thing, cause you know, Beasley is another guy, even prior to all this news. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1257.64s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1260.72s)]
*  I don't really want to pay you $14 million a year. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1262.1200000000001s)]
*  And he may have just because he shot it so well this season. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1265.72s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1268.4s)]
*  I mean, teams are always desperate. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1269.52s)]
*  I think I would have done that. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1270.92s)]
*  Not knowing. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1272.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1273.88s)]
*  I think I thought he was really good last year. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1274.16s)]
*  I know the playoffs, he was a little up and down, but I really liked [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1277.0s)]
*  how he played last year. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1279.88s)]
*  I thought he was important to them. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1281.0s)]
*  That he was feisty. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1282.64s)]
*  The real Ty Jerome on Detroit. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1283.76s)]
*  I like the feisty factor. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1285.4s)]
*  I could see him holding back Ron Holland. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1288.1200000000001s)]
*  I could see him convincing beef stew, not to charge back at the other team subtle, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  but maybe also trying to agitate things too. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1295.5600000000002s)]
*  I could see. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1297.8000000000002s)]
*  I could see Stu being like, well, now that Ty's here, we have two dogs, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1298.8400000000001s)]
*  but Jerome can initiate the offense. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1304.6000000000001s)]
*  He can play off of guys. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1306.52s)]
*  Kate could play off of him a little bit. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1308.0s)]
*  And I, I do think they tried to find ways to have Schroeder initiate some [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1310.04s)]
*  stuff to give Kate a break from just being the same every single time. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1314.24s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1318.48s)]
*  It's very clear that you need to have spacing around him. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1319.72s)]
*  So I think that's more important than them having another big guy, even [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1323.84s)]
*  if you felt at times, you know, it's asking a lot of during just hold up the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1329.8s)]
*  entire time against some of the bigger teams, if they're going to go a little [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1334.9199999999998s)]
*  bit deeper. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1338.28s)]
*  So yeah, I just don't think it's really that long of a list of $14.1 million [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1338.76s)]
*  guys for the non-tax payer mid level. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1343.84s)]
*  Would you rather have Ty Jerome or Malik Beasley, no gambling scandal [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1346.56s)]
*  next year for the Pistons? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1350.52s)]
*  I'm not saying this because of what happened today. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1352.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't really trust Beasley. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1353.84s)]
*  I think he's the guy that hit shots. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  And then the last two minutes of the game, I don't expect them to go in. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1356.8s)]
*  It would've been funnier if you said, I trusted him before today. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1359.72s)]
*  Now I don't trust him as much. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1364.64s)]
*  I went on an amazing rabbit hole with him. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1367.72s)]
*  I was, I was all the way into the 2023, 24 season game logs. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1369.56s)]
*  I was looking at the one that's being investigated. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  I actually think it's that was reported. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1377.56s)]
*  Look, I mean, this is not a rant about the innocent until proven guilty or the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1379.52s)]
*  guilty until proven innocent way that it seems to work now where people can just [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1385.1599999999999s)]
*  be charged with stuff. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1389.12s)]
*  And then it's just like your entire reputation is tarnished. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1390.12s)]
*  I just think there's a lot of dudes out there that see a bad play and then they [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1393.6399999999999s)]
*  post it and everybody's so excited to be like, yup, look at that. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1396.72s)]
*  He didn't get back on defense. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1401.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, the stuff that happened after that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1402.36s)]
*  Yeah, that was rough. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1403.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh wait. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1404.48s)]
*  So I thought that's what you said you were watching. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1404.9199999999998s)]
*  No, I was watching the, I was just, I [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1407.04s)]
*  wasn't watching. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1409.12s)]
*  I was looking at the game logs and trying to figure out. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1409.7199999999998s)]
*  Cause they was reported on ESPN that they were studying January, 2024. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1413.1599999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, huh, let's lock in here. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1419.08s)]
*  Went through and, uh, who knows? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1422.08s)]
*  But, um, it sucks because first of all, shitty story. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1424.8799999999999s)]
*  I feel bad for him. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1429.52s)]
*  Cause he played really well last year. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1430.4399999999998s)]
*  Um, and you know, it doesn't seem great when the feds get involved. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1432.4799999999998s)]
*  Not awesome. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1437.84s)]
*  So we'll see what happens with that, but they're going to [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1439.0s)]
*  have cap space to do whatever. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1441.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1445.6000000000001s)]
*  And it might, you know, sometimes teams go, let's use it now. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1445.8400000000001s)]
*  No matter what, like just make sure we use it before we lose this. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1450.1200000000001s)]
*  And then we'll worry about the asset management part of this a little bit [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1453.3600000000001s)]
*  later, but you know, the length of the commitment to the guys that are left over. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1455.92s)]
*  Like there's only a couple names that I'd feel really comfortable about [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1462.68s)]
*  going like a bunch of years with. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1465.52s)]
*  Alexander Walker. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1467.28s)]
*  I like him, but he's a bench player on a good team. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1469.4s)]
*  I mean, he gets, he could close with you maybe if he gets hot. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1472.16s)]
*  You know, it's not the worst thing, but you know, with the way Detroit is [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1476.3200000000002s)]
*  trending right now and hoping between a SAR, Cade, Ivy coming back healthy, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1480.44s)]
*  during Harris, when you're paying him north of 20 million a year, um, still [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1489.28s)]
*  trying to figure out what you have with Holland. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1494.8400000000001s)]
*  No, I, I'd rather pay Alexander Walker than cominga. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1496.48s)]
*  So you, you agree with me that Ty Jerome would be the move. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1500.92s)]
*  It makes the most sense. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1505.8s)]
*  I can, I can already see it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1506.96s)]
*  I really like it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1508.1200000000001s)]
*  Now we also could be like overrating them a little bit, but he was so, like [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1509.16s)]
*  he was so impactful in so many different games and I'm sure like, you [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1513.96s)]
*  know, best case scenario, it's like, does it become a, I don't know, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1517.96s)]
*  it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1521.92s)]
*  I tied Jerome Thompson debate of what they were doing even against the Knicks. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1525.0s)]
*  It's like, well, what do we want to do? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1529.96s)]
*  Do we want to close with defense or do we want to close with, with shooting? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1530.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1534.28s)]
*  Because to this point, a SAR is just not somebody anybody's going to close out [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1534.6s)]
*  on nevermind like a playoff game, even in the regular season. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1537.6s)]
*  So at least Jerome, I think brings that respect and probably clean, clear up [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1540.96s)]
*  some of the stuff for Cade and what he wants to do driving. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1544.28s)]
*  The free agent, 14.1 million free agent spot teams. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1547.32s)]
*  I think I have this right. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1551.2s)]
*  Indiana, Indiana, Atlanta, Philly, Milwaukee, Washington, Charlotte, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1552.9599999999998s)]
*  Chicago, Sacramento, New Orleans, Utah, OKC, Houston, Portland, San [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1556.9599999999998s)]
*  Antonio and golden state of coming to goes it's more than half the league. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1561.8799999999999s)]
*  And then you have a Brooklyn and Memphis have that 8.8. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1567.24s)]
*  A couple other teams do. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1570.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know how many people get the 14.1. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1574.28s)]
*  What would you do over under unfunded? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1576.4799999999998s)]
*  How many guys get the 14.1? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  Would you say more than five? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1582.0s)]
*  From the list you've seen, I mean, it seems like it's no, it does feel like [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1585.04s)]
*  it's a low number, but. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1588.92s)]
*  You know, it's how many teams think that they're in it. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1593.88s)]
*  Our teams in the West going like, Hey, let's go to ownership and be like, Hey, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1596.36s)]
*  what do you think we're going to do? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1599.96s)]
*  We're going to win 48 games and be like, okay, now let's use our 14.1 [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1600.84s)]
*  tax. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1606.48s)]
*  So Houston was the one. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1607.2s)]
*  Like, I don't even know if they need Phinney Smith, but that one made me think [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1609.44s)]
*  about it right. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1615.4s)]
*  Like, let's go for it here. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1616.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1618.68s)]
*  It's like, if you have Phinney Smith with Tari with a man and it's like, just. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1618.96s)]
*  I don't know that that did, but that was floating around a little bit today. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1625.8799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, Oh man, I don't even know if they need him, but that, if that, if [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1629.32s)]
*  they're going for it this year, uh, for the people listening, the UFAs Phinney [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1632.92s)]
*  Smith, miles Turner, technically right now, but everyone thinks he's going back [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1638.6s)]
*  to Indiana, Ty Jerome, Alexander Walker, Capella, Bruce Brown now underrated. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1642.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if you want to join me. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1648.6s)]
*  I'm buying some Bruce Brown is now underrated stock. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1649.7199999999998s)]
*  Uh, post-yoke itch. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1653.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1655.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1657.04s)]
*  Bisselli. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1657.32s)]
*  Can I answer you in a, in a 14 million glass of Yabba Silly? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1658.52s)]
*  Maybe 8.8. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1664.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1667.08s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1667.48s)]
*  I mean, to me, like anything under 10 is like, and you can play, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1668.24s)]
*  you can be a rotation guy. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1671.76s)]
*  Luke Kennard. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1673.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1676.48s)]
*  Where's the range for him there? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1678.48s)]
*  8.8. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1680.56s)]
*  The thing is, is like, if you go, Hey, we'll give you four for 40. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1681.6799999999998s)]
*  And then every agent is just going to say, we can get 14. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1684.32s)]
*  And then with as many teams as you just listed, like good luck being the GM [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1687.96s)]
*  that's going to call the bluff on a guy that you actually want. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1691.6799999999998s)]
*  So you're probably just going to pay him to 14. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1694.4399999999998s)]
*  I think I've said this to you, but my dream Luke and our team is Denver. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1696.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm putting him with the Oak edge. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1701.0s)]
*  I think it would be really fun. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  Schroeder, who I think is probably not a 14 guy, but might be an 8.8. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1703.12s)]
*  Man, this one hurts. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1709.1599999999999s)]
*  I, Luke Cornett, I think teams like them. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1710.6799999999998s)]
*  Like, uh, I don't think this is going to go well for the Celtics. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1713.12s)]
*  I thought there was going to be a way that they were going to bring back [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1717.8s)]
*  Luke Cornett and Horford and I don't see it. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1720.24s)]
*  So far, everything is working out for him. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1723.52s)]
*  So I'm not going to rule out anything. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1725.6s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1727.8s)]
*  I still can't believe that they were able to dump Drew's contract [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1728.6s)]
*  and get back Anthony Simons. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1731.0s)]
*  And I still can't believe that it's another fan base that holds out. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1732.6s)]
*  Hope that Persengus is going to be healthy. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1735.32s)]
*  I said it was a borderline miracle on my Thursday pod that they [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1739.2s)]
*  shared $28 million with those two guys. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1743.72s)]
*  It was incredible how it turned out. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  I was getting texts like, yo, what's up with Brad? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1749.6s)]
*  Is he like a fucking wizard? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1752.04s)]
*  Like, what's, how did he do this? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1754.32s)]
*  I still like KP, but I, you know, why cut 22 million? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1756.8799999999999s)]
*  I thought was, uh, was a miracle. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1764.12s)]
*  Can you expand on why you, you like Persengus? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1767.7199999999998s)]
*  I think for what Atlanta gave up, like whatever it's one year. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1771.08s)]
*  It's a one year flyer in him. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1774.36s)]
*  When he played last year, he was really, really good. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1775.6799999999998s)]
*  I have no idea what happened to him in the playoffs. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1777.8799999999999s)]
*  Nobody's been able to answer it. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1780.04s)]
*  And we've all agreed never to talk about it again. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1781.48s)]
*  For some reason, the guy was unplayable and looked like he had like a, like a virus. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand what happened. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1790.08s)]
*  And now he's fine. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1791.36s)]
*  He's playing for the Lafayette team. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1792.56s)]
*  It's really weird. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1795.28s)]
*  When he's healthy, he's good. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1796.84s)]
*  And the idea of what he can be is a rim protecting stretch five is still really [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1798.36s)]
*  valuable, but even when the Celtics had made that deal, even though I liked them [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1803.96s)]
*  a lot, I was like, so you had a tack on like two more years at 30 plus million. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1806.48s)]
*  For this guy. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1811.0s)]
*  And then I still feel like Celtics fans revisit 24 being like, you know, he was [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1811.8s)]
*  huge. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1816.1599999999999s)]
*  It's, it's kind of, it's kind of like the guy that's getting laid off and you're, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1818.1599999999999s)]
*  you're saying it like the lunch where people are getting cake or whatever. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1822.8s)]
*  And it's like, although there's usually not a lot of cake. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1826.08s)]
*  That's where, that's where Persengus was for you. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1828.56s)]
*  Is the guy getting laid off at lunch? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1830.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but people will just like pat him on the back and be like, you know, this [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1832.8s)]
*  department, just none of this would have happened without you when the realities [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1836.4799999999998s)]
*  of he was that valuable, then he probably would have still been there. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1840.2s)]
*  And it felt like that's what people were saying about Persengus in the 24 title [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1843.0800000000002s)]
*  run was like, well, those that Dallas got one Dallas game. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1846.16s)]
*  Do you really think he was great during this season though? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1850.4s)]
*  Come on. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1853.44s)]
*  He was great during the season, but he got hurt. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1853.92s)]
*  He got hurt. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1856.8s)]
*  Like everybody was worried that he would get hurt and he got all the time. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1857.28s)]
*  He got hurt again. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1862.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1863.44s)]
*  And so the way I've seen the Atlanta part of the acquisition is like, Oh, you [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1863.8s)]
*  know, like, like, sure, maybe. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1869.32s)]
*  And at least for them, it's only one year. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1871.9199999999998s)]
*  Then Celtics had to make that extra investment, but it becomes one of those [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1873.56s)]
*  transactions that's going to be remembered as a win because they won a title when [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  they didn't need him for the title run 24 whatsoever and not having him again. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1880.36s)]
*  This year and having this version. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1885.48s)]
*  I understood why Missoula tried to play him. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1887.1599999999999s)]
*  It was clearly he was trying to get something out of him, but I actually feel [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1888.72s)]
*  like that transaction was a loss, but no one will ever remember it that way [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1893.12s)]
*  because they want a title. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1896.6s)]
*  I think it's a win because they won a title last year sucked and then they [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1900.6799999999998s)]
*  were able to get out of the contract. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1903.8799999999999s)]
*  So I think ultimately the fact that they were able to escape, but they [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1906.08s)]
*  escaped because it's weird. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1908.52s)]
*  I don't, I didn't do a good job of talking about this the other day. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1910.04s)]
*  I still don't know what Brooklyn was doing. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1913.56s)]
*  Getting the 22nd pick and Terrence Mann, who makes a real, real amount of money, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1916.4399999999998s)]
*  like 15 million, we just were, I was going through those UFAs with you. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1921.1999999999998s)]
*  If Terrence Mann was a free agent, I don't think he's getting 15 million. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1924.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1927.96s)]
*  Like I said, the other guys I was going to mention was Schroeder, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1928.64s)]
*  Cornett, Kavan, Looney, Baton, Porter, Gary, Trent, Tim Hardaway, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1931.5600000000002s)]
*  Brogdon, Chris Paul, Laverte, Horford, Duncan Robinson. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1937.5200000000002s)]
*  Now you go on and on, but, um, a Terrence Mann for 15 million is not exactly a [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1942.48s)]
*  bargain and I wasn't that excited about the 22nd pick in the draft. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1948.1200000000001s)]
*  So I don't really know what Brooklyn was doing with that. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1951.6000000000001s)]
*  Did you understand that? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1954.0s)]
*  It's a weird one. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1957.6799999999998s)]
*  When they already had, when they already had all those picks to take on the money. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1958.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, four fucking first rounders already. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1964.0s)]
*  And especially the way people felt about this draft, I guess there's all sorts of [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1964.9599999999998s)]
*  like man Bogdanovich net stuff that I don't understand, like collectively [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1969.9599999999998s)]
*  about the whole transaction. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1973.7199999999998s)]
*  It's like, okay, so you didn't want to lose Bogdanovich. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1974.9599999999998s)]
*  You were sick of him. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1977.76s)]
*  Granted, he just sucked this past season that he was with Atlanta. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1978.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1982.1599999999999s)]
*  And so it's like, all right, let's get this guy out of here. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1982.6s)]
*  So they trade him at the deadline and don't forget Bones Highland in that [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1985.96s)]
*  transaction, and then they take on man's contract and then it's like, now we [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1991.12s)]
*  have to dump it and granted, you know, leadership had changed and everything. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1996.0s)]
*  So, uh, it was just a weird series of transactions. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=1999.2s)]
*  It's like, why did you trade for him? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2003.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2005.6s)]
*  So Atlanta basically trades Niang, Terrence Mann, and the 22nd pick to take [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2006.28s)]
*  a real flyer on Porzingis with some flexibility to do some other stuff. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2012.36s)]
*  I still kind of like it. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2015.84s)]

*  Guess what? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2049.84s)]
*  Since you stayed longer than a week, you saved over $200. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2050.48s)]
*  You know what that means? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2054.04s)]
*  More shellfish. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2054.72s)]
*  I love shellfish. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2055.68s)]

*  That is loom.com. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2090.28s)]
*  So we're talking about those, uh, there's six RFAs and it seems like Grimes is [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2092.84s)]
*  going back to the Sixers for in that 14 to 60 million range. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2098.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2102.44s)]
*  It seems like a pretty big number. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2102.64s)]
*  I was surprised he had like one big month for them. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2105.7999999999997s)]
*  We've got to watch him for the last four or five years. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2109.92s)]
*  And it just seemed a little aggressive. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2113.8799999999997s)]
*  Didn't you think? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2116.48s)]
*  I thought it would have been like around 10, unless they thought he, there was [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2117.08s)]
*  some team that was just going to sign him if they didn't give the money. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2121.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2126.16s)]
*  I think sometimes too, it's like anybody like you're only making so much. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2126.32s)]
*  They go, well, he, you know, he's going to make that much after the fact. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2129.56s)]
*  And I've always kind of liked them a little bit, even going back to those [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2132.56s)]
*  next years, and then it was something else to get on Dallas's case about by [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2135.92s)]
*  getting rid of him and then bringing in the Caleb Martin contract where you're [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2139.6400000000003s)]
*  like, why are you bringing in this? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2142.52s)]
*  How about that guy? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2145.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2146.04s)]
*  People starting to understand the vision because the lottery just worked out for you. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2146.28s)]
*  There was a vision all along. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2151.1200000000003s)]
*  The vision was we're going to, we're going to cash in on 1.8% chance to win the [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2152.32s)]
*  lottery. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2156.48s)]
*  We've had a vision all along that we would have a miracle in May. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2157.44s)]
*  Sixers has been busy though, cause Ubre picked up the option. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2161.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2166.8s)]
*  I thought you were going to report that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2166.96s)]
*  I was waiting to hear that from you. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2168.4s)]
*  Well, honestly, from another reporter, he hasn't been one of my favorites, but [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2170.0800000000004s)]
*  for 8.4 for him, that's kind of a win. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2173.6400000000003s)]
*  But that's, yeah, that's, that's one of the differences though, between like [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2176.7200000000003s)]
*  what's Ubre's representation saying to him about like what's out there for him. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2180.32s)]
*  And if they're coming back going, Hey, we didn't even think you could get the 14. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2183.84s)]
*  Then that's clearly why he's picking that up. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2187.4s)]
*  Lonnie Walker, see Eric Gordon. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2189.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I don't know. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2192.52s)]
*  There was some rumor that declining the 3.4 million means they can even be the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2194.1600000000003s)]
*  lower number bringing them back. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2197.6800000000003s)]
*  Certainly that's still in the ballpark, but the Grimes number, he was really [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2198.84s)]
*  productive, but yeah, I think we're in agreement that I was like, man, that [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2202.52s)]
*  thing's going to get north of like 15 million for him. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2205.36s)]
*  I was surprised. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2207.92s)]
*  I would have guessed in the tense. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  There's, there's some other veterans like Russ is back. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2210.8s)]
*  I know you're excited about that as a free agent. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2213.56s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2215.48s)]
*  GP two is out there. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2217.28s)]
*  I like him. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2219.88s)]
*  Brook Lopez, who I did not think was good last year, but I think there's so few [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2220.76s)]
*  centers out there that he'll get one more where you stand on Larravia. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2225.4s)]
*  I like Larravia. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2229.92s)]
*  I just kind of like them too. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2230.8s)]
*  You know, is a one more shot, probably short years. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2232.76s)]
*  Maybe I'd overpay for a year to give it a, but I'd have to have like a club [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2236.1200000000003s)]
*  option on the second year, maybe. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2240.24s)]
*  And then maybe his reps are like, absolutely not. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2241.56s)]
*  Like it depends on where he's going to go and what kind of options he's going to get. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2243.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, do you have any key analysis excitement? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2248.04s)]
*  Very active player. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2252.0s)]
*  Didn't we? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2256.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2256.64s)]
*  I know you're not a fan. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2256.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, we know where you're standing on D'Angelo Russell, who's available. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2259.2799999999997s)]
*  Ties Jones, not acquit himself great in Phoenix. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2264.16s)]
*  It really starts going downhill from the. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2266.6s)]
*  From the RFAs, uh, Santi Aldama, I think is an interesting one. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2269.7599999999998s)]
*  And I wonder if he could slide into that 14.1 potentially for somebody trying to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2275.16s)]
*  pull them out, I think Memphis will match. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2280.56s)]
*  Well, they be psyched. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2282.44s)]
*  They'd be thrilled if they took an offer sheet at 14.1, because I think [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2283.4s)]
*  he's a $20 million guy. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2286.7599999999998s)]
*  If Jabari's that high. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2289.12s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2290.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that you put them in the Jabari level. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2291.2s)]
*  He's more productive than Jabari is. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2294.24s)]
*  I actually think he's shown more than Jabari has in my head. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2295.76s)]
*  I am a notch lower, but maybe you're right. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2299.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2302.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2303.6800000000003s)]
*  I think Aldama is actually pretty underrated. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2303.8s)]
*  I'm not telling you like, did I think he's like a, a two on a really good [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2305.44s)]
*  playoff team, but the Bain contract and that deal, even though we had a lot of [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2309.48s)]
*  fun as soon as it had happened, it seems pretty clear that it was about flexibility [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2314.1600000000003s)]
*  for whatever is coming for Elbama, a Jaren Jackson extension, and then, you [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2318.2000000000003s)]
*  know, figuring this thing out on the fly again. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2323.6s)]
*  And maybe there's another piece. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2325.96s)]
*  I think they were excited about, uh, maybe they knew they had a chance to [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2327.72s)]
*  get coward in the drafts. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2331.64s)]
*  I think they love Wells. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2333.2s)]
*  They have all these other dudes. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2334.44s)]
*  I think they just seems like they felt like wings by committee. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2335.52s)]
*  We can replace Bain's stats, which I'm not against. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2338.88s)]
*  I still don't think they should have traded them, but I get the logic. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not against, I'm not against the logic of it. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2345.3199999999997s)]
*  I just want to trade it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2347.64s)]
*  But it does feel like they're in, look, they're one of the smarter front offices. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2349.24s)]
*  I think what they do is they go, okay, you know, this is a hall for Bain and [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2352.64s)]
*  we really like them, but we're getting in front of this and then we can clean up [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2357.12s)]
*  our books and now we're going to have multiple chances here to fill things in [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2359.8799999999997s)]
*  around how, you know, we identify the top three guys, you know, maybe El [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2364.56s)]
*  Dama is that third, maybe he isn't. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2369.56s)]
*  Wells is certainly more of a defensive guy. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2371.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2373.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2373.92s)]
*  But if El Dama were, there's no way he's going to sign an offer sheet for 14.1 [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2374.2s)]
*  million because the Grizzlies would be pumped. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2380.6s)]
*  I would think their reps would already know like, Hey, partner plan is getting [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2383.0s)]
*  you settled. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2386.8799999999997s)]
*  You think he would sign that? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2387.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I just, I don't know anything anymore with these numbers. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2389.96s)]
*  I don't know who I can't get a handle on it. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2393.16s)]
*  I'll be the first one to admit it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2395.68s)]
*  But so the difference with that Bain trade versus how I felt about the [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2397.4s)]
*  new Orleans trade a couple of days ago, the Bain trade, I get the logic. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2400.72s)]
*  I just personally would have done it, but I get it. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2405.08s)]
*  And if you feel like you can replace them with the wings, like I get it. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2407.2799999999997s)]
*  The new Orleans, not putting a top five protection on that pick. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2411.12s)]
*  I don't get, you're never going to convince me that that was a good idea. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2415.28s)]
*  And I know you feel the same. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2418.88s)]
*  And I know everybody else who falls basketball, like nobody will ever [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2420.36s)]
*  understand why you played it that way. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2423.64s)]
*  It was poorly done and that's it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2425.48s)]
*  And it has nothing to do with whether you think Derek Queen's good or not. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2427.52s)]
*  He might be really good. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2430.52s)]
*  The point is you put this crazy price on moving up 10 spots that you didn't need [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2431.6800000000003s)]
*  to do and is absolutely reckless and incomprehensible. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2436.68s)]
*  And I still don't get it. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2442.12s)]
*  Five days later, four days later. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2443.08s)]
*  I don't get it, man. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2446.72s)]
*  Everybody's talking about it too. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2447.64s)]
*  Still. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2449.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2450.24s)]
*  It's the, it's the, it's them and LeBron are the, been the two kind of stealth [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2451.04s)]
*  topics right now, but the, what the hell is New Orleans doing? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2455.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of nets in there. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2459.68s)]
*  They really did it. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2465.16s)]
*  A lot of ball handlers. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2466.68s)]
*  There's some, there's some, your guy Yang. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2472.44s)]
*  I definitely feel like, uh, I think your guy Yang. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2474.3599999999997s)]
*  Bill, I want a couple of minutes on him. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2479.56s)]
*  The floor is yours. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2481.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2482.8799999999997s)]
*  And this goes back to your New Orleans point. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2486.12s)]
*  So if they're really calling around, trying to move up for Derek Queen and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2488.48s)]
*  they have for Portland, can we move up to your spot? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2493.2s)]
*  Uh, to number 11, before they trade back to 16. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2497.96s)]
*  Can we move up to 11? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2501.9199999999996s)]
*  Cause we really want Derek Queen and you can have 20, 23, whatever it was. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2503.04s)]
*  And you could just, and we'll give you this crazy unprotected pick. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2510.2s)]
*  They could have taken Yang at 23, right? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2514.16s)]
*  Nobody would have. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2516.16s)]
*  Nobody would have taken him from there before that. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2518.24s)]
*  You really feel like he would have gone before 23? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2522.68s)]
*  He was killing it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2525.7999999999997s)]
*  The combine dude. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2527.12s)]
*  Uh, chances are no Chinese joker. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2529.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2533.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause I was getting a, a few of the picks like ahead of time. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2533.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2537.8399999999997s)]
*  And so why got all I got was, Oh, Oh my God, waiting till you see 16. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2538.16s)]
*  So the guy wasn't going to like, yeah, give it to me because he wanted [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2544.8399999999997s)]
*  me to experience it live. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2548.68s)]
*  Do you have any chance you have any thought in your head? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2550.04s)]
*  Yang could go in the top 25. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2552.16s)]
*  No, no, but I did get a few texts of like your guy. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2554.64s)]
*  Uh, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2558.52s)]
*  the back door shit was really high level. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2565.12s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't watch enough of it. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2567.2s)]
*  Oh, I watched all of it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2568.96s)]
*  I was, I was, uh, he, I got him and he wasn't on my radar going into [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2570.08s)]
*  Wednesday night, but he, he jumped into the radar. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2574.2s)]
*  I'll tell you, if you watch his mix tape, you're like, how did [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2577.52s)]
*  he last until 16? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2579.88s)]
*  It's in the future of basketball. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2582.36s)]
*  I heard that at the very least, they just feel like there's revenue from him [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2584.88s)]
*  because of the China pipeline. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2588.6800000000003s)]
*  When you, when you have these guys on a team, you just make money from them. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2590.12s)]
*  You make real money and if he, and if he's good, it's a bonus, but then [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2594.44s)]
*  they obviously liked him as a player too, as a project, but if you can get [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2597.96s)]
*  this guy and keep them on your team for five years, there's real [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2602.1600000000003s)]
*  revenue that comes with that. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2604.92s)]
*  It would help if he's good too. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2606.04s)]
*  Hollinger does a really good job on like, just pointing out, like there's a [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2607.52s)]
*  lot of international start up stats that are good indicators. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2611.52s)]
*  They're better than college stats and how they translate to what you should [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2615.92s)]
*  expect college player becoming an NBA player. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2618.64s)]
*  And his argument was like, Hey, look like the league he played in, he [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2621.44s)]
*  wasn't exactly killing it there. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2625.0s)]
*  And that's a little alarming. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2627.2000000000003s)]
*  NBA castoffs are crushing it. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2629.32s)]
*  That can't even stick in the NBA and they're killing it in this league. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2632.7200000000003s)]
*  And like now granted he's really, really young, but for somebody that big that [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2637.16s)]
*  moved that well, that these little flashes of like, well, that was kind of cool. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I figured, okay, he's guys definitely going to get drafted now. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2645.56s)]
*  But I didn't, yeah, there's no way I thought it would be 16. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2648.7599999999998s)]
*  It's so funny that he went to Portland, the team probably that you and I talk [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2651.04s)]
*  about the most that just makes no sense. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2655.96s)]
*  That should be in our lives in any way. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2658.24s)]
*  And now like, you know, the true thing, I still feel like there's some real [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2660.56s)]
*  benefits with the, uh, with the leadership stuff and the veteran stuff with him and [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2664.72s)]
*  just having like a real adult in there. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2669.3999999999996s)]
*  And he's a beloved teammate. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2671.48s)]
*  There's reasons beyond just trading. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2672.8399999999997s)]
*  Simon's pretty expensive. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2674.48s)]
*  Beloved teammate, man. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2676.12s)]
*  Two years. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2677.16s)]
*  Listen, they're trying to change the culture. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2677.72s)]
*  They're trying to build around the defense last time. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2680.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2683.68s)]
*  I mean, two years ago, they're trying to tank as part of the trade. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2684.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2687.9599999999996s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2688.48s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2689.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2690.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2690.56s)]
*  They're taking the fear is I just, I'd rather not pay a [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2690.8799999999997s)]
*  37 year old guy two years from now. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2694.56s)]
*  37.4 million for vibes. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2697.16s)]
*  Here's the other problem is the playoffs. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2701.2s)]
*  I think made us all nervous with him. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2704.12s)]
*  It wasn't awesome. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2708.04s)]
*  If he's moving toward a slightly different phase of his career, that [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2710.6s)]
*  37 year contract, but listen, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2713.56s)]
*  I thought it was a big price to pay. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2717.48s)]
*  And I still like when we were talking about more on the Celtics side, but I [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2719.7999999999997s)]
*  can't get on Portland. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2722.4s)]
*  They took my guy lobs, scoot to Yang. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2723.28s)]
*  And then here's the thing. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2727.32s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2728.0s)]
*  He was, he was Hanson Yang at the combine and now he's young Hanson. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2729.1200000000003s)]
*  So who knows opening night, what his name is going to be then going to be Dave. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2733.28s)]
*  Dave Yang. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2738.2000000000003s)]
*  No, I'm serious. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2739.6000000000004s)]
*  Like there's so many times with international guys, you just go through [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2740.44s)]
*  the cycle of what the fuck's this guy's name again. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2743.7200000000003s)]
*  So potentially we could have scoot, true holiday, Kamara, Denny. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2747.84s)]
*  And Yang out there all at the same time. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2753.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2756.44s)]
*  I'll have a good time. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2757.0s)]
*  I just tell me for the first eight and quote, when Yang's getting his minutes. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2758.0400000000004s)]
*  Cause they still have Klingon too. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2765.44s)]
*  I assumed as teams got desperate for centers that there would actually be an [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2767.84s)]
*  eight market that would materialize and I'm not going to count it out because. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2772.76s)]
*  I mean, let's, we should talk about the trade that sextant Nurgis trade today. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2777.6400000000003s)]
*  I thought that was a dumb founding trade. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2781.08s)]
*  I didn't understand that at all. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2783.44s)]
*  Utah traded sextant with a second round pick to get Nurgis back. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2785.2s)]
*  And I can't tell if this means centers have become more valuable or what's [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2789.7999999999997s)]
*  going on because Phoenix tried to trade Nurgis for two months last season and [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2793.72s)]
*  nobody wanted them and they finally had to attach some stuff to get rid of them. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2797.68s)]
*  Sexton say what you want about the dude. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2801.88s)]
*  The guy's like a 40% three point shooter and scores 18 a game in like 28 minutes. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2804.64s)]
*  Like he's a real guard. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2809.4s)]
*  He's a real offensive player that would help a bunch of good teams. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2811.04s)]
*  And Charlotte just basically took them. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2815.4s)]
*  I didn't understand that trade at all. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2817.88s)]
*  The only thing I can understand is between Collier and County George, who, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2820.96s)]
*  you know, you still have hope for with Utah and then, you know, you just feel [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2825.6800000000003s)]
*  kind of guard heavy and Clayton jr is coming in Clayton jr, the draft pick, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2830.4s)]
*  who was awesome as we all know. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2835.36s)]
*  You know, they clearly, they don't really know what they are at this point. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2837.28s)]
*  And we'll see what happens with the ACE and all these different things. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2841.96s)]
*  Like they wanted to make some room, but I would tell you like the player you're [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2843.7200000000003s)]
*  getting back in Nurkic versus the player that's going out and they're both [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2846.6400000000003s)]
*  expiring around 19 million and you can get on their case for having to attach [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2850.28s)]
*  a second round or, you know, whatever. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2853.8s)]
*  It just feels like player for player. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2856.1200000000003s)]
*  Charlotte got the much better player. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2857.84s)]
*  And I have an extra reason that I think that trade happened, but we have to say [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2860.36s)]
*  goodbye to a loom by Atlassian because that special portion of today's episode [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2863.72s)]

*  That trade was so weird. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2888.3599999999997s)]
*  That trade was so weird. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2890.3999999999996s)]
*  That trade was so weird that I now feel like Utah, that was the trade before the [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2891.64s)]
*  trade. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2896.56s)]
*  I really do. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2897.2799999999997s)]
*  I, I, and you know, there's been rumors about them trading Kessler, the Lakers [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2898.24s)]
*  have wanted them for two years, but, um, I was just in a trade machine rabbit hole [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  trying to figure out what the next move was. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2908.08s)]
*  And do you have any, well, there's a LeBron piece we have to talk about because [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2910.48s)]
*  there's no, not LeBron to Utah. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2915.2s)]
*  I don't, I don't feel like that would happen, but I think Utah is a [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  facilitator in a three team trade with Utah and Cleveland. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2921.16s)]
*  I just feel like I, it just sent my shit detector off and that rarely happens [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2927.16s)]
*  with trades where I'm like, huh, I'm pretty sure Danny age knows basketball [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2931.2799999999997s)]
*  and I know Austin does, and they just traded Colin Sexton with a pick to get [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2937.16s)]
*  NERCage and I just feel like that means something else is going to happen. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2941.3999999999996s)]
*  I was in the trade machine trying to figure it out because they could send a [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2944.92s)]
*  bunch of stuff. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2948.68s)]
*  They could take contracts back. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2949.32s)]
*  And the bigger question is, is LeBron going to stay with the Lakers, which [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2951.56s)]
*  is the other topic that has been a big behind the scenes thing. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2955.32s)]
*  Um, he did the thing today where he opted in for the 53 million had to put out, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2958.88s)]
*  um, through Rich Paul that, um, he's going to be monitoring closely all the movement. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2964.44s)]
*  I don't know what he thinks the movement's going to be because they're [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2970.1600000000003s)]
*  paying him and Luca combined $98 million. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2972.4s)]
*  The cap's 154. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2975.0800000000004s)]
*  They're keeping Reeves. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2976.92s)]
*  They have $70 million more in contracts. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2978.04s)]
*  There's not a lot of movement. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2980.6s)]
*  They're not going to be able to trade Reeves first center. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2981.84s)]
*  Um, they can't extend Reeves either. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2984.16s)]
*  And I don't know what he thinks is going to happen with this team. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2986.52s)]
*  And I don't, I don't know if he's staying and I don't know what the move is [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2991.64s)]
*  because once you opt in, you're basically saying a trade and at that point it's [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=2998.2s)]
*  Cleveland, there's a bio possibility, which I don't understand in a million [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3001.72s)]
*  years why they would ever do that. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3006.44s)]
*  And I don't know how this plays out, but it feels like we're going to be talking [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3007.76s)]
*  about it for the next three weeks is my guess. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3010.96s)]
*  When he first opted in, like the first thing I was looking at was like the [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3014.2400000000002s)]
*  Dorian, Phinney Smith decision on where that would put them between a full mid [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3017.76s)]
*  level and a taxpayer mid level, which is, you know, you're talking about some of [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3022.1600000000003s)]
*  the names you've already covered or maybe Brooke Lopez, you know, for the [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3027.36s)]
*  taxpayer mid level. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3031.7200000000003s)]
*  So when I was looking at that, I was thinking, did he really take like the [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3032.6800000000003s)]
*  full boat and now they can't bring in a full mid level guy when they desperately [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3036.68s)]
*  need a center, are they going to be left? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3040.8399999999997s)]
*  No trade too. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3042.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3042.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3043.2s)]
*  And so after Phinney Smith opts out, and then I looked at it again, it looks like [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3043.96s)]
*  they're going to have the full taxpayer mid level. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3049.08s)]
*  So like the angst that I think LeBron, some of like the early angst was, is this [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3051.08s)]
*  going to cost the Lakers a decent center option versus here's the budget bin of [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3055.04s)]
*  centers because however, now it still could get a little weird. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3060.72s)]
*  I'm sure there's, there's moves to be made, but, um, I don't, I don't really [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3064.16s)]
*  know like why it's not about him taking less money because I don't know that I [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3070.3599999999997s)]
*  ever feel comfortable being like, Hey, you should take less money. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3074.96s)]
*  You should take less money. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3076.96s)]
*  But what he can't do is be upset. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3078.48s)]
*  You can't be upset, which we've seen over and over again in the NBA. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3082.72s)]
*  You've chose to reenter the situation. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3086.12s)]
*  You can't then. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3088.64s)]
*  You can't get mad about it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3090.2799999999997s)]
*  The lack of options that the team will likely have. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3091.64s)]
*  And you know, like Kobe got that massive extension at the time when none of us [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3095.56s)]
*  could ever believe it, and if you don't have the pieces around it and you're kind [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3099.2s)]
*  of just paying a collection of guys that aren't very good, and then you're kind [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3103.2s)]
*  of stuck financially and then it's like, man, nobody wants it more than Kobe's. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3106.12s)]
*  Like he can want it all he wants, but there's no outs, there's no outs where [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3110.24s)]
*  any of this talent coming out. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3114.88s)]
*  So, I mean, unless there's a Reeves deal where they feel like, Hey, we're [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3116.2s)]
*  less like dominant on the perimeter or it's three guys taking turns. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3120.12s)]
*  You know, maybe, maybe there's something there. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3126.6s)]
*  It's beyond that though, the three guys, because none of them are good [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3128.56s)]
*  defensive players. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3131.16s)]
*  I mean, LeBron is sometimes a good defensive player, but when you're [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3132.0s)]
*  thinking about a team built around those three, we saw it in the playoffs. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3135.24s)]
*  It's not going to work if those are your three guys. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3139.92s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3142.3199999999997s)]
*  And especially LeBron is going to be 41 next year. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3143.48s)]
*  This is only going to get worse. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3146.72s)]
*  It's not going to get better. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3147.96s)]
*  Even though I thought in the regular season, he exceeded expectations, but [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3148.88s)]
*  got hurt in the playoffs in the first round. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3152.04s)]
*  You get older, you're just going to get hurt more often. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3154.2400000000002s)]
*  It's the way it goes. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3156.2400000000002s)]
*  And they're paying him and Bronnie together is 55 million. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3157.84s)]
*  You add Luca, Luca has a big extension coming. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3162.88s)]
*  There's just no way to improve the roster. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3165.68s)]
*  And every Laker fan I talked to says, well, you just got to trade Reeves [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3167.4s)]
*  for a center. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3171.0s)]
*  It's like, well, who's the center. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3171.6s)]
*  Go through all the teams. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3173.76s)]
*  Who are you getting? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3175.56s)]
*  Like, are you going to be happy with like a Congo and why would Atlanta do that? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3177.2400000000002s)]
*  Like he just, I, I just think they're stuck with this roster and they're stuck [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3181.48s)]
*  between the proverbial rock and a hard place and it's going to lead to, um, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3186.2400000000002s)]
*  some sort of move with him. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3191.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't believe for a second that he doesn't want to win another title and [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3193.6400000000003s)]
*  that he doesn't care about rings. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3196.8s)]
*  I think he does. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3198.0s)]
*  I just don't believe it. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3199.44s)]
*  You don't believe what part. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3202.96s)]
*  When he's talking about ring culture, that stuff doesn't matter. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3204.88s)]
*  Like, I think he wants to win the title again. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3208.36s)]
*  He's going to try to go to a situation where he can win the title. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3210.76s)]
*  So you think this is, this is the precursor to him actually moving on [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3213.7200000000003s)]
*  because that Cleveland thing. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3217.16s)]
*  I do. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3218.48s)]
*  I think it's in play. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3219.28s)]
*  I really do. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3220.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3221.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3222.12s)]
*  I'm not disputing it, but when I look at the Cleveland side of it, that's the [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3222.44s)]
*  one that I'd understand and you know, a third team, I know that's always our [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3225.04s)]
*  kind of default of like, Hey, to make this happen, who's going to third team [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3228.84s)]
*  this thing, but why would I move out Garland in Jared Allen? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3231.92s)]
*  No, it wouldn't be. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3236.48s)]
*  I don't think it's Garland and Jared Allen. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3237.28s)]
*  I think it would see there. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3239.32s)]
*  I think it would be Jared Allen with Hunter and that you could get a third [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3241.2400000000002s)]
*  team involved and make something work with that pretty quickly, but the Garland [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3244.84s)]
*  piece is weird because I think he is out there a little bit in, in like, uh, I [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3249.0s)]
*  think he's, I think teams feel like he's attainable, like you're going to have to [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3256.92s)]
*  pay for him, you're not just going to steal him, but I, I don't think he's not, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3260.76s)]
*  I wouldn't say this. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3264.76s)]
*  I don't think he's untouchable. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3265.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, the, the stuff about him being the Durant trade was wrong. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3268.0400000000004s)]
*  I think that was something Phoenix wanted, not them, but I do think, you know, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3271.6800000000003s)]
*  I do wonder from a Cleveland standpoint, do they worry that this is the guy who [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3276.32s)]
*  gets hunted in the playoffs and can we change our team if we change our team in [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3281.5200000000004s)]
*  some way, that's who we should do with, you know, where I stand on Garland. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3285.5600000000004s)]
*  I would not trade him. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3289.96s)]
*  Um, I think his two injuries, he had a fucked up toe, which could happen to [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3291.76s)]
*  anybody and he broke his face. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3295.36s)]
*  Like, it's, you can't say like he's injury prone. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3297.84s)]
*  Um, and I just think he's really good. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3300.68s)]
*  And if I was another GM, I'd be trying to get him right now. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3303.4s)]
*  If there was even a shadow of an opening that he might be available, like if I'm [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3306.48s)]
*  named a team, I would be like going hard after trying to get him. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3311.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3315.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3315.48s)]
*  I don't know what Sacramento has. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3315.64s)]
*  It's enticing at all. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3317.16s)]
*  Chicago already traded other guys, but even when you look at the Lakers, like, is [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3318.84s)]
*  there a Rui deal out there for somebody is Vando have any trade value at this point? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  Does anybody care about Gabe Vincent at 10 million for the one? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3328.36s)]
*  So if this team is going to, cause there was that stretch there, right? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3331.2799999999997s)]
*  They figured it out defensively. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3336.36s)]
*  Like the funniest thing about the Lakers timeline is that they're not going to [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3337.52s)]
*  be able to get a lot of people in the Lakers. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3340.72s)]
*  Like the funniest thing about the Lakers timeline is as soon as they make the [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3343.08s)]
*  Luka trade, you're like, okay, well, this is where the future makes all sense in [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3345.7999999999997s)]
*  the world. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3348.04s)]
*  You're one of the best players in the world who cares about 25. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3348.52s)]
*  And then they figure some stuff out. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3351.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3353.52s)]
*  And then they get this great seat and you're thinking defensively. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3354.2s)]
*  And then people are actually talking about them. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3357.64s)]
*  And I think it was a bit of like the overvaluing, just the Lakers part of it, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3359.08s)]
*  where everybody's picking them in that first round series against Minnesota. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3362.6s)]
*  And then that seems like one of the most absurd things ever now in hindsight, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3365.7599999999998s)]
*  because you're like, why did they, why did they think they're going to be able [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3369.2s)]
*  to hang with him? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3371.2799999999997s)]
*  And Jackson Hayes is so bad that JJ just pulls the plug because like, if you're [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3372.0800000000004s)]
*  telling me that Jackson Hayes getting more minutes would have solved your [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3375.04s)]
*  problems in playoffs, then I would say that we're just going to disagree and [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3377.1600000000003s)]
*  move on from that whole thing. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3380.1200000000003s)]
*  So, and they, they were really physical with LeBron in a way that was surprising. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3381.2400000000002s)]
*  Randall was excited when LeBron was on. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3386.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was a weird thing to see. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3388.8s)]
*  But that's the thing when I talk about building around those three guys, I mean, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3390.92s)]
*  we will see what kind of shape Lucas in next year, but if those are your three, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3394.48s)]
*  with what we just watched from Maho Kooma city, I don't, I don't think it works. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3398.16s)]
*  And I think LeBron is smarter about basketball than just about anybody in the [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3401.56s)]
*  planet. And he has to see that like his, his supercomputer brain has to look at [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3405.48s)]
*  like, all right, if these three guys are out there in crunch time for us and I'm [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3411.0s)]
*  one of them and we're playing a team like, okay, see who else needs to be on our [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3414.4s)]
*  team? Well, we need like an awesome rim running center, defensive shop, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3419.3199999999997s)]
*  to protect all of us. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3424.0s)]
*  Well, how the fuck are we going to get that guy? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3425.88s)]
*  We've already traded all of our at like that guy doesn't exist. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3428.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, is it, is it going to be Kessler? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3431.2400000000002s)]
*  That's going to be, that's going to change you from being, but it's so much [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3433.88s)]
*  better game to four rounds. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3437.2000000000003s)]
*  I know, but it's still so much better than having no one. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3438.96s)]
*  But also why am I trading Kessler from Utah? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3442.0s)]
*  That's the other part. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3444.96s)]
*  I want to get something back. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3445.56s)]
*  Like there's nobody has centers like that anymore. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3447.0s)]
*  Even like somebody like Klingon, I feel like has more value. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3448.96s)]
*  So I think you're looking at like a Deandre Ayton type of, you know, moving a [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3451.44s)]
*  bunch of contracts, attaching a pick and trying to roll the dice with like [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3455.84s)]
*  somebody like him. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3459.64s)]
*  And is that going to get you four rounds? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3461.12s)]
*  No. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3462.88s)]
*  So I, I just think he's trying to figure this out because I don't, I just don't [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3463.28s)]
*  believe him. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3467.64s)]
*  I think he wants to win the title again. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3468.12s)]
*  Good luck on the Ayton thing. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3471.4s)]
*  I do want to see it happen. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3472.64s)]
*  It's just that, I mean, that's such a massive, but it's 35 and a half million [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3474.36s)]
*  for him in this final year. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3478.84s)]
*  You could do the Kleber, Vincent, like you could throw some, you could patch [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3479.6800000000003s)]
*  some contracts together and attach an asset and maybe, I don't know. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3483.92s)]
*  I just want to see him go somewhere to watch that fan base talk themselves [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3488.0s)]
*  into it and I'll sit back and be entertained. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3491.28s)]
*  Like Miami would be my favorite. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3495.1600000000003s)]
*  Can I walk you through a fake trade I made? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3499.2400000000002s)]
*  I probably don't have a choice, but I do want to hear it. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3502.32s)]
*  So I think it's in your real estate. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3504.48s)]
*  LeBron and his son go to Cleveland. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3506.8s)]
*  What if his son is like, actually, no, does he even trade me? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3510.1600000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3513.88s)]
*  Utah gets Darius Garland and Rui Hachimura. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3516.1200000000003s)]
*  The Lakers get Kessler, Lonzo ball, Jordan Clarkson and John Collins. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3521.44s)]
*  And, um, I don't know. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3529.2400000000002s)]
*  And, um, Utah has to throw a pick or two, has to sprinkle some picks around [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3533.64s)]
*  because ultimately they're getting Darius Garland. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3543.2799999999997s)]
*  The youngest. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3546.16s)]
*  This is your sextant thing. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3547.52s)]
*  This is tied to the sextant thing. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3549.56s)]
*  You get Nerkage because you know, you have Kessler going in this other trade. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3552.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3556.16s)]
*  I was excited about it. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3556.52s)]
*  It's like, Bane goes to the magic and be like, is Jaren Jackson better [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3558.08s)]
*  with the Lakers or the Clippers? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3561.12s)]
*  I just sit them on the record. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3564.2s)]
*  I don't think Cleveland should trade Darius Garland, but I'm just saying, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3565.36s)]
*  like, I wonder if those types of deals are being talked about, or could you [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3568.2799999999997s)]
*  do like a Darius Garland to our team, Toronto for who with Max Streus and [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3572.8s)]
*  the Lakers get Pertle and RJ Barrett and LeBron just goes to Cleveland. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3581.16s)]
*  Like that, the reason I'm bringing up these trades is like, if LeBron's [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3586.96s)]
*  actually leaving the Lakers, these are the type of trades that would have to happen. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3590.44s)]
*  For this to happen. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3595.6s)]
*  And the other option would be where the Lakers buy him out and he just jumps on [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3596.88s)]
*  a team and I don't know why they would do that in a million years. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3600.96s)]
*  So I think this is the whole reason I'm talking about this is I think this is [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3604.92s)]
*  going to be really hard now that he's opted in for any other outcome than [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3608.56s)]
*  he's just on the team doing that. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3612.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3615.52s)]
*  We'll see what they do. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3617.36s)]
*  I'm monitoring it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3618.16s)]
*  It's like, okay. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3619.16s)]
*  Glad you're monitoring it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3621.0s)]
*  Like we're not going to be able to get a center. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3622.0s)]
*  Like, do you want us to trade two unprotected first rounders for Kessler? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3624.32s)]
*  Like why we have the Lakers have Luka Dancic now. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3629.32s)]
*  Why are they doing that? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3631.84s)]
*  Like they, they're in Luka mode now for the next 10 years. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3632.64s)]
*  How do we build around Luka? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3635.4s)]
*  So it's really awkward. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3637.08s)]
*  I, and I'm surprised it's not a bigger story. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3638.32s)]
*  I think this is pretty strange. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3640.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3644.2400000000002s)]
*  But what do you think should have happened? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3644.48s)]
*  You think you should have taken less? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3646.84s)]
*  Do you think they should have? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3647.84s)]
*  Well, he has the no trade, so he's going to be able to veto anything. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3648.56s)]
*  Do you think they should have tried to figure out what else should have happened? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3651.16s)]
*  Well, I think that's what he wanted. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3654.72s)]
*  I think he wanted a longer commitment. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3656.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, come on. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3659.12s)]
*  He's 40 going to be 41. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3660.8s)]
*  That's, this is why I'm talking about this. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3665.4s)]
*  Like, I think this is a really weird situation on top of it. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3667.2s)]
*  They just sold the team and then he gave his whole side a heads up on any of it. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3670.36s)]
*  Which you can argue. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3675.68s)]
*  How do you not get a heads up? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3677.0s)]
*  That transaction has been talked about for two years. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3678.88s)]
*  I get it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3681.24s)]
*  I'm just, I'm just telling you the stuff I've heard. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3682.36s)]
*  Um, so I don't know. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3685.64s)]
*  It's a weird one. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3688.0s)]
*  And you could feel the Lakers shifting toward Luka, which is a situation [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3688.8s)]
*  he's never been in before. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3692.84s)]
*  My granny has been in the league 23 years, so it's maybe time for some new situations. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3694.76s)]
*  But, um, I think they have a new owner. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3699.8s)]
*  Got paid a lot of money and they're going to gear this thing toward Luka. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3703.96s)]
*  And they have to figure out the Lebron piece. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3708.96s)]
*  And I don't know how they figure it out. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3710.56s)]
*  And maybe this will turn into like, you know what, actually let's I'm good here. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3711.84s)]
*  Let's stay. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3715.32s)]
*  But I think it's worth monitoring. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3716.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3719.96s)]
*  But the likely outcome is what they figure out some sort of center. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3720.12s)]
*  We don't know which world they'll be in. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3724.6s)]
*  They probably get the benefit. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3727.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3729.08s)]
*  But they're going to, I doubt they're going to go into it without one again. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3729.44s)]
*  Do you have Laker fans in your head for his like, we just got to get bam. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3732.92s)]
*  Not in my life, but I'm, I'm aware of people just think like, well, just, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3737.6s)]
*  well, we'll just get Quint Capella. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3743.16s)]
*  It's like, okay. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3744.84s)]
*  You seen Quint Capella the last couple of years? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3746.04s)]
*  That would have been a huge, you couldn't get. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3748.2799999999997s)]
*  Pella would have been a much better option than Jackson. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3751.0s)]
*  Jackson Hayes. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3754.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3755.08s)]
*  Fair. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3755.6s)]
*  Even if it's pretty clear that Capella is on the decline here and why Atlanta [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3757.0s)]
*  went the route that they went with the compu. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3760.88s)]
*  But the likely scenario here is what he doesn't, does he really want to leave LA? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3763.96s)]
*  He makes his 50 plus million. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3768.2000000000003s)]
*  His son's still on the team. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3769.6400000000003s)]
*  Luca comes back even better shape. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3771.32s)]
*  You know, they're, they're able to outsmart teams. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3774.48s)]
*  Lucas is in such good shape. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3776.56s)]
*  LeBron's reinvigorated. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3777.7200000000003s)]
*  That's probably how it's probably, I would bet on that as the maybe most likely [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3778.88s)]
*  scenario, but I still think there's a lot of smoke, like 47 and a half, 48 and a half. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3783.48s)]
*  I mean, we still got to figure out. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3789.1600000000003s)]
*  Card. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3789.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3791.16s)]
*  You got to add the extra two. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3791.32s)]
*  They always pad the, it's like the red Sox over under for wins. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3793.0s)]
*  There's certain teams where they pad the over under because they know the [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3796.36s)]
*  fan, the team is a huge fan base. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3799.56s)]
*  So I'd say probably like 47 out 48 and a half. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3802.48s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3808.4s)]
*  Luca could come show up and look like, like, look like the best shape. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3809.52s)]
*  We were all in disbelief. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3815.64s)]
*  How good he looks. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3817.0s)]
*  And he's one of the best five, six, seven players in the league. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3818.76s)]
*  And maybe that's 50 wins if he's just in awesome shape playing great. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3823.0400000000004s)]
*  You know, we've seen guys just be like so good that they're just in the 45 to [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3827.48s)]
*  50 win range because they're on your team. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3831.76s)]
*  And really what they need is they need like a 28 minute a night center who can [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3834.8s)]
*  run all night, can run for Luca. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3839.32s)]
*  You don't have to necessarily be a stretch. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3842.4s)]
*  I mean, they're not going to be able to afford the rim protecting run all night, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3843.96s)]
*  young guy who's also a stretch five. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3846.84s)]
*  So that's, that's not going to happen. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3848.92s)]
*  But considering what Luca has done in the past, some of those Dallas teams, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3851.28s)]
*  and you figure offensively, you're going to be fine. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3855.6000000000004s)]
*  They ran into the worst matchup. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3859.52s)]
*  If they had, if they had faced golden state with their lack of size, you [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3861.28s)]
*  know, maybe golden states like, Hey, this is great. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3866.32s)]
*  We actually don't have to worry about the Laker size conversely, but it, it's [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3868.1600000000003s)]
*  probably, there's probably like two matchups there with how weird the seating [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3871.32s)]
*  was just shuffling throughout the last couple of weeks of the season, where [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3875.52s)]
*  something that looked like it was a benefit of the Lakers to fight to get a [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3878.52s)]
*  three seed. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3880.6800000000003s)]
*  So I still think they're probably even with their flaws last year, just [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3881.6800000000003s)]
*  anything that's a plus, anything that JJ Reddick can look down at the bench and [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3886.1600000000003s)]
*  go like, okay, well, at least I feel okay with this guy for 20 minutes. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3889.8s)]
*  And if there's nights that we want to go small and he doesn't necessarily have [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3892.7200000000003s)]
*  to play because he's not a guy that's a $20 million a year center, cause that [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3895.6800000000003s)]
*  transaction is not going to be able to happen. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3898.36s)]
*  I still think they'll be like in a decent enough spot if everybody's healthy [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3900.52s)]
*  again, that it's, it's going to feel like they're somewhat competitive and that'll [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3904.6s)]
*  probably be enough, I would think, but you seem to think that there's much more [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3909.0s)]
*  like there's some really potential. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3913.7599999999998s)]
*  Like you've, the reason you keep bringing this up is you think there's potential [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3916.52s)]
*  for something crazy, all like some crazy scenario. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3919.16s)]
*  I think crazy is in play now. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3921.84s)]
*  Um, there's also like there's regular season versus playoffs, which we talk [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3924.32s)]
*  about a lot, whatever happens in the regular season with, with whatever team [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3929.36s)]
*  they end up with versus what we know is going to be needed in the playoffs. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3933.96s)]
*  That we watch every year and we're like, Oh yeah, defense. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3938.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3942.68s)]
*  You need depth. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3943.12s)]
*  Like they just have a lot of shit that they need to pull off. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3943.92s)]
*  Um, that's a big one for me. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3948.0s)]
*  Atlanta's $25 million trade exception. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3953.28s)]
*  I think is fascinating because in, in some ways that's the best spot [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3958.08s)]
*  for, um, I don't know what, like whether you could that be like a [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3963.44s)]
*  DeMar DeRozan spot if Sacramento just wants to get off his deal. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3967.48s)]
*  Could that be part of like, they help out with the trade package in general? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3970.6s)]
*  And I know people have talked about it all week. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3975.2000000000003s)]
*  I think Atlanta is an unbelievable shape with the roster they have and the assets [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3977.16s)]
*  they have to put, you know, they're not at, they're not at where Houston is from [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3981.2000000000003s)]
*  a close to win the title standpoint, but it's a little similar in that I just [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3986.7200000000003s)]
*  like a lot of their pieces and they have flexibility. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3990.68s)]
*  And they don't have to, you know, they have some extension stuff coming. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3993.2000000000003s)]
*  You're going to have to pay Trey in a year. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3996.36s)]
*  Um, they're going to have to pay Dyson. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=3998.2400000000002s)]
*  But for right now, they actually have the flexibility to do a couple more things. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4000.76s)]
*  And I think they should. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4005.4s)]
*  I think, I think the East is, as we've talked about many times is sitting there [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4006.76s)]
*  to make a move and that's a team that I think I'm really interested to see what [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4011.1200000000003s)]
*  they do over the next 10 days. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4015.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it could be. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4017.76s)]
*  Um, you know, they're probably going to end up having a decent record if they [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4018.5600000000004s)]
*  get this group right, um, with what's happening in the East. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4022.6s)]
*  I do think it was funny too, when you were mentioning Miles Turner, it's like, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4026.52s)]
*  okay, this patient's team never pays the tax, never pays the tax. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4029.64s)]
*  Turner is going to be free agent. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4032.6s)]
*  It has to be north of 20 million. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4033.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, if Randall can get 30, if, if Nas gets a five year deal, he's [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4035.64s)]
*  somewhere between those guys, right? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4041.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4042.72s)]
*  You have to feel like he's north of whatever the number is that puts them in [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4042.92s)]
*  the tax. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4045.72s)]
*  And then I was like, I wonder if because Halliburton's injury, they could be like, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4046.16s)]
*  well, you know, since we're not going to have Halliburton, like, does that turn [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4049.08s)]
*  into some weird Turner thing? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4054.52s)]
*  But I doubt it. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4055.96s)]
*  I highly doubt it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4057.0s)]
*  But yeah, I could see a scenario where the Hawks, every year they disappoint me [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4058.44s)]
*  with like, I think we've spent three summers in a row going, I kind of like a [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4063.44s)]
*  lot of the pieces, you know, look at all this depth and look at all these [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4066.6s)]
*  different options that they've had. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4069.04s)]
*  This is the most excited I've been about them. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4071.08s)]
*  I really like, I really like the nucleus. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4075.68s)]
*  It makes sense to me. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4079.68s)]
*  We're going to find out once and for all about Trey young, I think this season [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4081.16s)]
*  what's actually there. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4086.44s)]
*  This is the perfect roster to have around him for the most part, although [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4087.4s)]
*  it still feels like they're one kind of reliable score short that would, uh, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4090.64s)]
*  would help them out if he didn't have it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4096.16s)]
*  Um, is Cleveland standing Pat? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4098.56s)]
*  We talked about Garland earlier. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4101.96s)]
*  That's another one. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4103.32s)]
*  Are they just going to be, are they going to feel like they need to do [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4104.0s)]
*  something or I was thinking about, especially in the eighties or nineties, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4108.56s)]
*  when a season doesn't turn out the way you think it's going to turn, you know, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4112.280000000001s)]
*  the Lakers had a couple of those seasons in the eighties where they weren't like, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4116.84s)]
*  Oh, now we have to trade Byron Scott. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4119.72s)]
*  We lost in round two, you know, and they're just like, no, let's [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4121.64s)]
*  stay with the infrastructure. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4124.360000000001s)]
*  The smartest teams kind of didn't panic if a season didn't turn out the way they [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4125.8s)]
*  thought Cleveland, I don't know. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4130.200000000001s)]
*  I, I could, I think they should stand. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4133.68s)]
*  I would roll it back with this team. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4136.6s)]
*  You're going to lose Ty Jerome, but I would just be like, you know what? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4140.4800000000005s)]
*  The East got worse. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4143.08s)]
*  We won 64 games. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4144.280000000001s)]
*  That was fucking weird. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4146.200000000001s)]
*  Garland was hurt. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4147.240000000001s)]
*  Moby missed the game. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4148.160000000001s)]
*  Like we lost a fluky, crazy Halberd and buzzer beater game. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4149.88s)]
*  Let's not overreact. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4154.84s)]
*  Let's just run it back. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4155.76s)]
*  But these teams in 2025 and the 2020s aren't wired that way. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4157.280000000001s)]
*  Like they always overreact. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4161.120000000001s)]
*  So would you ever react to you to run it back? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4163.04s)]
*  No, I mean, even when they lost, I was like, you were ready to [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4165.360000000001s)]
*  fire up the trade machine. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4168.8s)]
*  You had two laptops open, like an oil's future. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4169.84s)]
*  I did. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4172.320000000001s)]
*  Uh, oil futures. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4173.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4174.6s)]
*  So if anything, I mean, after what just happened with Tatum, Halliburton, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4174.88s)]
*  throw Dame into that mix, what's going to happen with Milwaukee. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4181.52s)]
*  I think it'd be irresponsible to not run it back and give this [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4185.04s)]
*  group one more year together. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4187.56s)]
*  And granted the Sam Merrill deal means Jerome's probably gone. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4189.72s)]
*  So Sam have to see my guy, Sam getting paid. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4194.400000000001s)]
*  I thought I got to say that was a little rich. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4198.320000000001s)]
*  I was surprised. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4199.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4201.2s)]
*  Would have guessed like, uh, it was basically Hauser money. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4203.52s)]
*  Be 1 million more than drew holiday makes in three years. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4206.68s)]
*  You really didn't like that trade. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4211.96s)]
*  I did. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4214.16s)]
*  And I like Portland too. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4214.64s)]
*  I just thought it was really expensive. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4215.8s)]
*  You know what we didn't do? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4218.8s)]
*  We didn't really even finish any of the Pelican stuff. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4219.52s)]
*  We kind of tease at it. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4222.280000000001s)]
*  But that had that next let's go. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4223.4s)]
*  All right. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4226.48s)]
*  So if I understand this correctly, so Joe Dumars comes in, let's go. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4226.879999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4233.679999999999s)]
*  Brings in Troy Weaver. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4235.32s)]
*  Troy Weaver has spent the previous year with the wizards as a consultant. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4236.879999999999s)]
*  So there were rumors before the draft, even the day of that they [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4241.16s)]
*  were going to take queen seven. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4245.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4247.639999999999s)]
*  They don't, they take fears, but at that point, everybody in [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4248.92s)]
*  the NBA world knew like Pelicans love queen. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4253.32s)]
*  They love queen. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4255.92s)]
*  All right. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4256.639999999999s)]
*  So then Yegor goes eight for the nets. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4257.32s)]
*  First piece of their adventure, their five part adventure, right? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4260.16s)]
*  Um, a bunch of picks go off the board. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4264.679999999999s)]
*  You've got the coward trade. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4268.759999999999s)]
*  So that takes out 11 S and gay for him to leave his team to come to the [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4271.639999999999s)]
*  draft meant that somebody high up enough, like was telling you, we [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4277.639999999999s)]
*  don't, we are going to draft you. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4281.76s)]
*  And he's like, I'm in, I'll get a suit. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4283.64s)]
*  So then it gets to the, the Derek queen pick. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4286.12s)]
*  So it's like, okay, so Pelicans clearly liked him and boy, did they really like him. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4290.320000000001s)]
*  Uh, and they, they moved back. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4294.56s)]
*  Well, they move up 10 spots for the unprotected. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4298.56s)]
*  When I first saw the trade, I, and I know you've already touched on, I talked about [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4300.52s)]
*  it on the first day I could do it on Thursday, but I kept waiting to think I was wrong. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4303.96s)]
*  I was like, is there some language in this that I'm not understanding? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4309.24s)]
*  I don't, I don't quite get. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4311.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4313.52s)]
*  Oh, it was the second of the two picks. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4313.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4316.2s)]
*  There's a better one. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4316.56s)]
*  And then, yeah, yeah. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4318.0s)]
*  There's by the way, I think Atlanta might've done. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4319.320000000001s)]
*  So we get the worst of the Milwaukee or New Orleans like, all right, so we're done. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4322.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4328.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4328.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's like, I'm going, cause the other thing too, is it's like to move up 10 spots [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4328.72s)]
*  because I don't even know if the nets, if the nets wanted to move from eight to six, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4331.76s)]
*  does Washington say yes for the other four? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4336.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4339.72s)]
*  I, that might be a no. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4340.2s)]
*  Washington might not take four extra first rounders just to move back two spots. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4341.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4346.36s)]
*  Because the NBA draft, it doesn't really work that way. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4346.76s)]
*  So you're moving back. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4348.84s)]
*  You're moving from 23 to 13. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4351.24s)]
*  And so then you go, okay, so Weaver did really like him. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4353.599999999999s)]
*  And then there's the Weaver part of it. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4356.24s)]
*  They've already traded for Jordan pool where you're like, all right, you want to [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4357.44s)]
*  tell me it was just a bad roster and he got shots up and he didn't take it seriously. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4362.84s)]
*  Like the tape isn't very good. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4366.76s)]
*  Um, you know, these stories, he was great in the locker room and all this different [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4368.6s)]
*  stuff. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4371.24s)]
*  It's like, okay, but that means you're paying an extra 30 million. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4371.4400000000005s)]
*  You've got an extra $30 million a year for the CJ expiring that sent out. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4373.96s)]
*  You want to tell me you think CJ's on the down, down side of everything. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4377.88s)]
*  Fine. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4380.72s)]
*  But he was kind of like the whole point of him being there was the adult in the room, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4381.04s)]
*  the guy that got it, the guy that wanted to be in New Orleans, which is pretty rare. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4383.88s)]
*  You know, he, there you go. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4387.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4389.2s)]
*  Little cheaper, but you trade out CJ. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4389.92s)]
*  Fine. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4395.52s)]
*  But for pool who, no, I'd rather have CJ on my team, but now pools an extra year at [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4396.400000000001s)]
*  30 million, another wizard's guy. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4402.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4404.8s)]
*  So you've taken a Maryland kid that you've done this unprecedented trade for because [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4405.56s)]
*  we just still can't believe it. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4410.4400000000005s)]
*  You traded for the extra $30 million. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4412.56s)]
*  You're in pool. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4414.56s)]
*  You brought in Micah who played at Georgetown. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4415.96s)]
*  You brought in the undrafted Hunter Dickinson, who was a Demathicid. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4418.5599999999995s)]
*  There's an alarming connection of like how regional this is becoming, whether [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4423.44s)]
*  it's the wizard stuff or anybody in that area. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4428.88s)]
*  And I, I got to tell you, like the idea, like I know Dumar, cause I was looking [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4433.72s)]
*  for it when he, when he did the press conference, he was like, we took, we, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4439.76s)]
*  you know, once pick seven went off, like, you know, they had fears, they take him [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4442.24s)]
*  seven, then we started calling everybody. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4447.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4451.24s)]
*  Do you really think that like, does Memphis say no, if they offer that [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4452.64s)]
*  unprotected in 26 because they've already done the deal with Portland? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4456.72s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4459.68s)]
*  Do you think Phoenix says no because of Malawatch for a pick next year, the [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4460.5199999999995s)]
*  extra pick, they could have taken somebody at 23 in the movement. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4465.0s)]
*  Maybe they desperately wanted. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4467.32s)]
*  By the way, why would Brooklyn have said no? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4468.64s)]
*  At eight? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4472.08s)]
*  I would have done that in five seconds. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4473.84s)]
*  Maybe because Brooklyn was like, can we use one of these picks? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4476.080000000001s)]
*  You know, it's, that's, I don't know. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4478.84s)]
*  I just thought that Milwaukee, New Orleans pick was such an amazing asset. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4483.160000000001s)]
*  Cause God only knows with Milwaukee and then New Orleans that, that, you know, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4487.96s)]
*  that team's going to be, that team's going to be a mess. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4492.360000000001s)]
*  Uh, Chicago at 12, it would have been criminal if they turned that trade down. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4496.360000000001s)]
*  Like that's, everyone should be fired if they turned that, if that was offered to [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4500.56s)]
*  them and they're like, no, we have our guy. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4503.6s)]
*  Like you should quit. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4505.4400000000005s)]
*  You think Toronto would have turned it down for Murray Boyles? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4508.400000000001s)]
*  Well, as we found out, we don't even really know who was running Toronto. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4512.240000000001s)]
*  They fired their, they fired their guy the day after the draft. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4516.64s)]
*  That actually happened. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4520.400000000001s)]
*  That was weird. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4521.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4522.0s)]
*  Honestly though, I think that happens in sports more than people realize. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4522.360000000001s)]
*  It's like, we're going to get ready to you, but because you've already worked [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4525.92s)]
*  with this entire staff the entire year prepping for this draft night, like [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4528.0s)]
*  you're going to run the room, but there's probably still somebody else who, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4532.240000000001s)]
*  cause his number two still there. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4535.72s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, like the guy that, that Atlanta dealt with here was Bryson [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4537.64s)]
*  who came, come over as the assistant GM who used to work with New Orleans. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4542.08s)]
*  So that makes me go like, who also probably knew that they like Queen, right? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4546.160000000001s)]
*  He was under the head with that. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4550.8s)]
*  So I just, I can't, I tried to just figure it out. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4552.64s)]
*  What are you trying to land the plane on here that you feel like that it's [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4558.04s)]
*  actually even more dysfunctional than it seemed like from afar? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4560.96s)]
*  I don't know why Brooklyn would turn it down. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4566.24s)]
*  I don't know why Toronto would turn it down. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4567.88s)]
*  I don't know why Phoenix would turn it down. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4569.56s)]
*  I guess I can understand why Portland in the Memphis deal would have said, Hey, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4571.32s)]
*  we already did too much work on this, but that's where a GM probably goes. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4574.72s)]
*  Are you fucking serious? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4577.0s)]
*  Hey Portland, guess what? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4577.92s)]
*  Or Hey, guess what? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4579.84s)]
*  Zach and Memphis, like we're out Chicago. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4581.0s)]
*  It's like, Oh, we promised Essengay. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4583.24s)]
*  Hey, you know, I mean, the guy just flew and left his team. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4584.76s)]
*  So there's, there's maybe individual step-by-step stuff. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4588.12s)]
*  You're like, yeah, this is why all of these teams turned it down. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4591.400000000001s)]
*  I have a hard time believing all of those teams turned down. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4594.24s)]
*  What's so many people around the league are like, I can't believe they threw in [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4596.6s)]
*  the unprotected pick. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4599.92s)]
*  Now the reality is as I land the plane here is what if Queen turns out to be [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4600.64s)]
*  really good? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4603.4400000000005s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4604.0s)]
*  Uh, what if that doesn't matter with the trade discussion? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4604.84s)]
*  I know, but you know, what happens is that we end up only evaluating stuff [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4608.12s)]
*  historically based on the results. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4611.84s)]
*  And this is the same as the Luca thing, not to the same magnitude, but it's like, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4613.360000000001s)]
*  if things were to work out for Dallas, it's like, yeah, but still the fundamental [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4617.4s)]
*  issue is you decided not build a market for Luca Donchich and whatever happens [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4620.32s)]
*  from that point on, that is the inexcusable part. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4624.12s)]
*  And I think in this transaction, again, not nearly the same magnitude, but the [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4626.8s)]
*  likelihood that this, this unprotected pick in 26 turns out to like, you know, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4631.36s)]
*  whatever the odds and the way the lottery goes, like all you guys freaked out about [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4635.4s)]
*  that a year ago and it ended up being the 11th pick. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4639.32s)]
*  And it's like, that's not the point. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4641.36s)]
*  The point is, is that the internal discussions at some point, somebody in [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4643.76s)]
*  the room has to go, Hey, is there a chance as much as we like Queen, we're [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4646.76s)]
*  moving up from 23 to 13 and Hey, we all like Queen a lot, but is there any chance [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4650.4800000000005s)]
*  that the unprotected 26 pick that we're including this, like say we in the West [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4655.4400000000005s)]
*  and things don't go well and Zion gets hurt. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4659.08s)]
*  And I know you already saw all this on Thursday's pod, but like, is there a [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4661.08s)]
*  chance we're giving up like the number one, could it be like worst case scenario? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4664.56s)]
*  Could it be the number one pick of the 26 draft when the answer is yes. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4669.24s)]
*  That's why so many people have freed that one. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4672.76s)]
*  There's one other, there's one other extra question to that. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4674.2s)]
*  If we just top five protected, are they still saying yes to the deal? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4677.04s)]
*  And the answer is yes. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4680.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4681.92s)]
*  But we have to move back 10 spots and it's just top five protected. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4682.36s)]
*  There's another crazy piece that I didn't even realize when I did my pod on Thursday. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4685.88s)]
*  They traded, they got that 23rd pick by trading their Indiana, 2026, first rounder, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4690.0s)]
*  which they traded during the finals before Haliburton got hurt. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4698.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4701.36s)]
*  And then Haliburton got hurt. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4702.16s)]
*  So they're in 23 by using a pick that then became way more valuable that they didn't [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4704.2s)]
*  know that it was going to be more valuable. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4712.36s)]
*  And Atlanta somehow ends up with Indies first and then they, the bucks first or [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4714.5599999999995s)]
*  the, I mean, it's just like insane how that played out for them, which is what I [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4724.04s)]
*  was joking on Thursday that they're like spraying champagne on each other after [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4727.679999999999s)]
*  that second trade. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4730.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4732.8s)]
*  And the smart part about the Pacers thing, cause we get back to the tax thing and the [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4732.96s)]
*  Turner decision and they're probably going, Hey, we like the 26 draft better. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4735.6s)]
*  Anyway, we're already a super deep team. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4738.76s)]
*  And even with the Turner discussion, we still have probably a couple other decisions [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4740.400000000001s)]
*  that we have to make on something like, Hey, it's awesome. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4743.76s)]
*  We're one of the deepest teams of the league. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4746.0s)]
*  Downside is now we have to keep figuring this thing out because we can't always [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4747.28s)]
*  keep it together. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4750.360000000001s)]
*  So let's, let's just go into next year's draft. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4750.84s)]
*  So I actually thought it was smart from the Pacers side of it. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4753.52s)]
*  Did you, were you hurt? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4755.88s)]
*  Atlanta has a lot of assets though. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4757.52s)]
*  What were we going to ask? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4759.2s)]
*  When the Pelicans official feed came after you, did you feel, what was that [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4760.84s)]
*  like for you that day? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4765.8s)]
*  Uh, laughter. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4767.12s)]
*  Laughter. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4771.2s)]
*  I laughed after pain. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4771.84s)]
*  Did you feel like you could have been a social media guy? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4774.6s)]
*  Seriously? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4777.0s)]
*  If it's 21 year old bill, 2025, I mean, granny, you don't make it a season [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4777.5599999999995s)]
*  because you'd be too clever, but they'd be mean. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4782.48s)]
*  I'm gonna get fired. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4784.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4785.12s)]
*  You a hundred percent. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4785.64s)]
*  Especially early 20s. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4786.4s)]
*  I'm definitely getting fired. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4787.44s)]
*  But I feel like these early 20s guys running team sites, they're like, they're [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4788.719999999999s)]
*  your spirit animal. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4794.24s)]
*  So it's almost like you're getting mad at yourself. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4795.5599999999995s)]
*  They, they retweeted. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4798.5599999999995s)]
*  What was it? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4801.759999999999s)]
*  A Shams on McAfee. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4802.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4803.839999999999s)]
*  Where it was an absurd. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4804.719999999999s)]
*  It was an absurd rationalistic. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4806.0s)]
*  I mean, he's, he knows way more info than us both put together, but it's [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4807.32s)]
*  like, what a bad, all the favor. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4810.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4812.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, fine. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4814.639999999999s)]
*  What if he does become a hall of Famer? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4817.08s)]
*  It's still a dumb trade. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4818.96s)]
*  You still gave up too much to get there. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4820.24s)]
*  Queen. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4822.04s)]
*  It was like, yeah, what if he's a hall of Famer and the pelicans feeds like, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4823.68s)]
*  yeah, fuck off ringer. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4826.64s)]
*  It's not what they said. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4829.5199999999995s)]
*  They were like, this take won't get you a podcast on the ringer, but was, you [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4830.4s)]
*  know, a pretty clear directed fuck you. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4834.12s)]
*  I love it. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4836.84s)]
*  And I just, I retweeted it immediately. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4837.16s)]
*  I love it down there. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4840.68s)]
*  I love it down there. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4841.72s)]
*  You know, this hurts. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4842.6s)]
*  It's a tough segment for me to do. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4843.5599999999995s)]
*  What's funny is I was looking at their roster and I do kind of, I kind of like [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4844.56s)]
*  all the pieces and they make zero cents together. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4848.88s)]
*  Like you actually look at all the things they have and it's like, I don't know [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4852.280000000001s)]
*  what this is, it's like, it's almost like a team you would put together in 2k. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4855.52s)]
*  Like, I guess Jordan Hawkins was probably fired up for five seconds [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4860.080000000001s)]
*  after they traded McCollum. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4863.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4866.320000000001s)]
*  Like if you're Trey Murphy, how are you feeling right now? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4868.6s)]
*  Well, thank God he's not from like Russia. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4872.080000000001s)]
*  You know, he's, he's from, he's from North Carolina. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4875.200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, like, hopefully that's close enough to the DMV to keep them [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4878.400000000001s)]
*  aligned with the, some of the recent decisions. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4887.72s)]
*  Well, what's weird is the team they're putting together as a team you'd put [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4891.04s)]
*  together, if you didn't care about next season, you actually secretly wanted [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4895.4400000000005s)]
*  a really high lottery pick. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4898.68s)]
*  It's just this whole collection of assets, but they [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4900.84s)]
*  don't seem to think that way at all. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4904.48s)]
*  They seem to feel like we're going to be good next year. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4905.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4908.48s)]
*  And it's like, they haven't noticed what conference they're in or that the [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4908.879999999999s)]
*  talent of all the other teams and also how unrealistic it would be to have a [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4912.04s)]
*  good team with the point guards they have and with Murray coming back from this [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4917.08s)]
*  injury and was how unreliable Zion is. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4921.44s)]
*  And it's just like, you'll be kind of fun to watch on league pass, but you're, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4924.799999999999s)]
*  you're not going to be good next year. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4930.24s)]
*  Like they can't actually think that. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4932.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4933.48s)]
*  The overriding messages were going to be aggressive. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4935.12s)]
*  It's like, all right, well done. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4937.2s)]
*  But you certainly were aggressive. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4939.839999999999s)]
*  Mission accomplished. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4941.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4942.36s)]
*  You did it. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4942.839999999999s)]
*  You pulled it off. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4945.0s)]
*  Um, a couple other things. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4947.08s)]
*  I was going to do the July desperation tears with you, but let's, let's take [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4950.5199999999995s)]
*  one more break and then we'll do that. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4955.2s)]
*  All right. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4957.0s)]
*  July desperation tears. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4957.36s)]
*  Is this a real thing? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4959.28s)]
*  I think Milwaukee, would you, would you have them one with how do we [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4960.28s)]
*  make this roster better? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4966.88s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4969.04s)]
*  I still don't believe any of the honest stuff about he's undecided. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4969.92s)]
*  Like I think he's going to be back in Milwaukee, but I also think there's [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4972.719999999999s)]
*  pressure on them to have a good roster. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4975.44s)]
*  They're bringing back body, Bobby Portis, but it's a little bit of [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4978.16s)]
*  make or breaky, I think for. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4981.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4983.92s)]
*  And that's in the bucks this season. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4984.0s)]
*  If we're not going to be a contender within this season, now you have to [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4985.5599999999995s)]
*  really reevaluate. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4988.28s)]
*  So I would put them number one on my desperation tears for, we have to [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4988.92s)]
*  get better right now. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4992.4s)]
*  Is there anybody you would put ahead of them as the number one desperation team? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=4993.5599999999995s)]
*  You're treating this like the 25 draft though, like Cooper's in his own [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5000.0s)]
*  tier because if you're telling me, well, Milwaukee's in their only tier, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5003.08s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5006.36s)]
*  I had them number one. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5006.92s)]
*  I had a couple other possibilities. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5007.76s)]
*  He's going to be in this conversation with Milwaukee, right? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5009.2s)]
*  Had them down as well. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5011.44s)]
*  I had Phoenix. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5013.639999999999s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5015.16s)]
*  You can't buy him out. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5018.96s)]
*  That'd be idiotic. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5020.200000000001s)]
*  Do you hope he's going to be better? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5023.16s)]
*  You can't trade them. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5026.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you bury him? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5029.12s)]
*  You'd be like, you know what? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5030.400000000001s)]
*  You're just not going to play basketball anymore. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5031.4400000000005s)]
*  We're not going to play you. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5032.76s)]
*  Getting ready for the road trip. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5034.64s)]
*  We have a lot of other things to talk about. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5035.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5037.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5038.240000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5038.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5039.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5040.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5040.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5041.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5042.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5043.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5043.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5044.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5045.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5045.56s)]
*  You're going to be in the road trip. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5046.04s)]
*  We have you in D 21 Southwest. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5047.4400000000005s)]
*  We have you in a room with two double beds. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5053.2s)]
*  I don't know what they did. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5057.2s)]
*  They probably just suck it up this year and then it's an expiring contract, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5058.08s)]
*  even though it's $57 million. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5061.360000000001s)]
*  But he still has the no trade clause. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5063.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5065.8s)]
*  It's an expiring contract that you can't move. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5066.360000000001s)]
*  I think the Lakers are in there from a desperation standpoint on getting [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5069.24s)]
*  nowhere last year. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5073.8s)]
*  I'm putting Sacramento in here because I think they're just a no man's land [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5077.360000000001s)]
*  and they've been in there somehow back to who they were for the entire 2010s. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5081.400000000001s)]
*  And they just have this weird team that doesn't make sense. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5086.320000000001s)]
*  And are they capable of anything? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5088.8s)]
*  Like Zach did his little thing for us yesterday. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5090.88s)]
*  And he was talking about, uh, didn't think Jaylen Brown was going to get traded, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5093.76s)]
*  but he was like, you know, that Sacramento is a team I would watch for that. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5098.04s)]
*  There is this team every summer that's just like, fuck it. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5101.88s)]
*  It makes some crazy trade. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5105.639999999999s)]
*  And I think that would be my number one draft pick for that category. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5107.12s)]
*  But would you put them in a desperation tier or no? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5111.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5115.5199999999995s)]
*  They changed management again, even though I think Monte McNair did a [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5115.8s)]
*  really good job there. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5118.639999999999s)]
*  Um, but now you're paying $90 million to Zach Levine and Savonis. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5121.28s)]
*  Uh, I know I like that plan. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5127.8s)]
*  No, I mean, I know I could get dumped on from being like, look, they [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5129.719999999999s)]
*  traded Halliburton for Savonis. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5132.4s)]
*  Although the Halliburton Savonis, that was like a 1200 page book. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5134.28s)]
*  It was like, oh my God, this is the worst. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5138.639999999999s)]
*  Be like, Hey, look at this. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5140.24s)]
*  Maybe good for both teams. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5141.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5142.5199999999995s)]
*  Like look at Savonis. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5143.16s)]
*  I mean, Sacramento, yeah. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5144.44s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, disaster. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5146.679999999999s)]
*  But Sacramento was judged based on Sacramento's history. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5147.92s)]
*  And considering their history, I felt like there was actually like a really [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5150.599999999999s)]
*  nice stable competitive run. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5152.839999999999s)]
*  They're in that game seven with the Warriors and they smoke them in the [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5154.48s)]
*  plan. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5157.0s)]
*  And, you know, nobody was like looking at them going, can they make some noise [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5157.56s)]
*  here as they flirted with playoff seating? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5160.6s)]
*  But for that organization, like that was a real improvement. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5163.36s)]
*  And so now you look at it and you're like, man, this got bleak quick. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5168.08s)]
*  I just don't like paying those guys that much. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5171.84s)]
*  I guess the Rosen's the asset. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5174.08s)]
*  He's 36 years old and he's, you know, look his number of 25 million is totally fine. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5175.56s)]
*  It seems like he's just going to age really well. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5181.12s)]
*  I remember the Bulls doing the first deal with him, bringing him in years and [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5182.68s)]
*  years ago was like, man, that was a lot for DeRozan. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5185.8s)]
*  And it just seems like this guy, the way he plays, like he still can bring [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5188.72s)]
*  something to a team, but what, what would be, what's like a realistic tier of [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5192.24s)]
*  player based on the, I mean, unless you want to start talking about Keegan or [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5198.12s)]
*  Devin Carter having a market, you know. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5203.16s)]
*  Not that teams wouldn't trade for Keegan, like he's, but you got to pay him [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5207.76s)]
*  after next year. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5211.96s)]
*  I don't think the Celtics are trading Jalen and I don't want to, but Zach did [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5212.84s)]
*  make me wonder like what kind of Sacramento crazy trade was sitting there. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5216.04s)]
*  Like how crazy would they get? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5221.08s)]
*  Um, cause we've seen them do it before. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5223.4400000000005s)]
*  Uh, I hope it doesn't happen. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5225.56s)]
*  I would put my in Brown for Trey Murphy. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5227.2s)]
*  So I did look at, I know that doesn't work, but no, you'd have to, there'd [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5231.56s)]
*  have to be a third team. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5236.52s)]
*  There'd have to be a third team where I think Jalen goes to a third team and [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5238.4400000000005s)]
*  Trey Murphy would be in the Celtics will cut salary. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5241.4s)]
*  There's ways to figure that out. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5243.799999999999s)]
*  But, um, I do think when they lopped off the $28 million, that kind of ended the [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5245.36s)]
*  Jalen any sort of entertaining a phone call. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5250.0s)]
*  I think that they, they already got to their objective. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5253.16s)]
*  I'm going to put Miami in the desperation tears. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5256.759999999999s)]
*  We can figure out the tears after I go through all the teams. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5259.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5263.2s)]
*  I said this a couple of days ago. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5264.24s)]
*  I just don't know what Miami, what are they? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5265.5599999999995s)]
*  What are they? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5270.52s)]
*  What are they trying to do? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5272.8s)]
*  Like, even if they get comingo, which I think is a good idea. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5275.280000000001s)]
*  And I like comingo. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5277.68s)]
*  I like their draft pick. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5278.56s)]
*  I liked it. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5279.72s)]
*  They got a 20 on third on Wednesday night, but I still don't know. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5280.160000000001s)]
*  Like, uh, they're going to pay hero. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5284.280000000001s)]
*  I guess a ton of money, which now when you're seeing some of the other money [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5288.04s)]
*  going, it's like, has he see, should he be making $15 million a year [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5291.56s)]
*  more than Julius Randall? [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5295.84s)]
*  I don't think he should. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5297.360000000001s)]
*  Um, I just don't know what's going on with that team. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5299.080000000001s)]
*  Do you have any handle on it? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5301.64s)]
*  Better hang Sacramento. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5303.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, great. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5307.0s)]
*  Hang bad hang. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5307.400000000001s)]
*  No, I'm just saying like, are they Sacramento in a more desirable NBA city? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5308.76s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5317.68s)]
*  So if you did it, if you did a draft of let's draft guys from Miami and Sacramento, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5319.320000000001s)]
*  bam goes first. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5325.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5327.160000000001s)]
*  Bam goes first. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5327.400000000001s)]
*  Sabona second. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5328.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5335.04s)]
*  I, I think, but Sabona's is like, you know, I think it's pretty clear against [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5335.96s)]
*  certain matchups in the playoffs. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5341.32s)]
*  It's probably not going to go great for you over Tyler hero. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5342.88s)]
*  Here's third. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5346.4s)]
*  Who's fourth. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5348.36s)]
*  The Rosen's got to be fourth, right? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5349.24s)]
*  You wouldn't have Levine over DeRosa. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5352.0s)]
*  Dude, it's me. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5355.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5357.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5358.599999999999s)]
*  I forgot who was asking. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5359.08s)]
*  I'll be like, Pell Larson. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5360.28s)]
*  You'd be like, Zach Levine still on the board. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5361.639999999999s)]
*  We're still like, yeah, I'm aware. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5363.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5365.879999999999s)]
*  So we'll go, we'll go Rose DeRosa Levine four or five. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5366.08s)]
*  Then who's the next guy in Miami you would have. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5370.08s)]
*  I love Jovich, but I mean, nobody should like him that much. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5377.48s)]
*  So did Miami. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5381.759999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't include him in the Durant deal. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5382.5599999999995s)]
*  I didn't think Jovich was good last year. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5384.639999999999s)]
*  I don't, the times I watched Miami, I just felt like I didn't really see it. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5386.16s)]
*  Maybe it's, maybe it's lurking under there somewhere. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5391.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I mean, look, I, there's guys I still hold out hope for. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5393.76s)]
*  I mean, we spent probably too long talking about Lavravia and as I was doing, I was [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5396.72s)]
*  like, this could also be a huge mistake. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5399.8s)]
*  Um, maybe if Lavravia stays in Sacramento, he goes higher in this draft. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5402.08s)]
*  Malik Monk's got to go before Roger. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5406.5199999999995s)]
*  Does he go before Davion Mitchell? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5409.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5412.68s)]
*  Keegan goes before Davion Mitchell. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5413.28s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5415.92s)]
*  You know, and then it's like, we were doing this two years ago with. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5420.16s)]
*  Hakez. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5423.84s)]
*  There he goes a lot higher. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5426.12s)]
*  I don't know what, what, I mean, they, they were like done with him. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5427.08s)]
*  He couldn't make a three last year. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5429.96s)]
*  Couldn't make one in college. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5432.32s)]
*  And that's why he lasted so long in the draft too. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5433.28s)]
*  Then he started just being really good. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5435.64s)]
*  So Miami, Miami is, is a higher end Sacramento. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5437.76s)]
*  I'm too online. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5443.0s)]
*  Let's start there. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5444.12s)]
*  Not news to anybody, but what happened is, and I ended up like getting too much of it, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5445.32s)]
*  but I always think it's funny when people are on social media and be like, how [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5451.72s)]
*  come I keep getting these posts? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5454.0s)]
*  And it's like, well, that's the danger before you thread as opposed to the one [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5455.32s)]
*  that you're following, dip your toes over to the four of you, and then you [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5458.5199999999995s)]
*  start hate watching stuff. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5461.64s)]
*  And then next thing you know, you're watching high school fights for half an hour. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5463.44s)]
*  You know, like, I don't feel like a good person right now. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5466.04s)]
*  I do. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5467.92s)]
*  And by the way, I don't watch them anymore. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5468.24s)]
*  It just got to me. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5470.6s)]
*  It bothered me. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5471.16s)]
*  I was worried about the future of society, but people thought. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5471.72s)]
*  In high schools. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5475.28s)]
*  I mean, do you ever see Greece? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5475.96s)]
*  I mean, so this is a new anyway. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5476.96s)]
*  So back when there was the NBA Yocitch thing, I couldn't stop. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5479.12s)]
*  Like I would just hate read every Sixers, like guy that had, you know, a few thousand [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5486.4s)]
*  followers and it was just always like insane NBA arguments against Yocitch. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5492.72s)]
*  And I just couldn't get enough of it. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5496.88s)]
*  And then all of a sudden my feed was just Sixer stuff constantly. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5498.12s)]
*  So I finally was able to wean myself off of it. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5501.6s)]
*  Years ago. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5504.84s)]
*  And I was all in on this heat thing. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5506.400000000001s)]
*  Just every guy with a couple thousand followers with a little bit of a heat page. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5509.6s)]
*  And again, I still think it's all teenagers, but if there was ever like a, a [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5512.56s)]
*  nationwide need for editors, like that's the problem is nobody has an editor anymore. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5518.400000000001s)]
*  You know, I could probably use one a little bit more often. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5523.16s)]
*  The number of heat trades that were so preposterous and were just so fucking [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5525.76s)]
*  terrible where the heat were never giving up anything and all of them. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5530.16s)]
*  And then it was always like, Hey, 72 hours to rant 48 hours to rant. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5533.16s)]
*  Like, Hey, we're, we're like a day away to rant. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5536.24s)]
*  Things going to happen in a couple of hours. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5538.639999999999s)]
*  And it just was like, guys kept doing it over and over again, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5540.2s)]
*  and source all this stuff to rant, rant, rant. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5542.639999999999s)]
*  Never happens. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5544.599999999999s)]
*  And clearly they didn't even really want them that much. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5545.2s)]
*  They must just not have wanted them nearly as much as, you know, maybe Phoenix. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5547.48s)]
*  How about this? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5551.76s)]
*  Never wanted them in the first place. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5552.4s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5554.04s)]
*  So you're, you're sitting here and looking at all of these options. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5554.88s)]
*  And it's the reason I compared to Sacramento. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5558.599999999999s)]
*  It's just, there's not a lot here to get you excited. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5560.72s)]
*  If you're like, let's, let's do a deal unless it's Wiggins, but Wiggins, I mean, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5564.8s)]
*  Wiggins still has a player option next year for $30 million. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5569.8s)]
*  The other problem is their 2027 first goes to Charlotte. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5573.52s)]
*  So it can't be like blowing up rebuild cause you don't have your first a year [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5578.360000000001s)]
*  from now, so there are no, I think Riley, I think Riley at this stage of his life [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5581.68s)]
*  is going to go, all right, reset button time. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5586.56s)]
*  Wouldn't you say he's more in the stage of let's get a guy and [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5590.84s)]
*  pay as many assets as we possibly can. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5596.56s)]
*  Just try to be better right now. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5598.68s)]
*  That's what I would have thought. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5600.52s)]
*  The Durant thing would have made sense. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5601.320000000001s)]
*  Do you think there's Lori marketing? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5604.280000000001s)]
*  I'm sidetracking now, but do you think there's Lori marketing [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5606.64s)]
*  and trade possibilities now? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5608.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5610.320000000001s)]
*  That's been another thing floating around right now. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5610.52s)]
*  What's your favorite Lori marketing team? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5613.16s)]
*  San Antonio had that as well. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5616.240000000001s)]
*  The cell in Barnes. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5619.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5621.0s)]
*  A couple of firsts in there. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5621.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5622.0s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be some sort of enticing pick there and [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5622.200000000001s)]
*  Ainge is probably just going to, you know, that's the other thing with Ainge [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5625.4400000000005s)]
*  is he's going to go, I'm not like, you don't think you're giving me the extra [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5628.76s)]
*  pick. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5633.6s)]
*  We figured out the Ace Bailey thing a week ago. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5635.360000000001s)]
*  Was that a we thing? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5638.320000000001s)]
*  It was a you thing. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5639.68s)]
*  I just, I signed up and I jumped in the car and the passenger seat. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5640.72s)]
*  We talked it through. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5644.96s)]
*  We did his pedigree. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5646.200000000001s)]
*  We did his pedigree. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5647.36s)]
*  We had a whole thing. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5648.4s)]
*  It was great. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5649.28s)]
*  It was good. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5650.24s)]
*  It was really good. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5650.679999999999s)]
*  And then you talked about his high school pedigree. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5651.4s)]
*  So it was, it was great. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5653.12s)]
*  And now Ace is super happy to be there. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5654.5199999999995s)]
*  It all worked out great. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5656.28s)]
*  Um, is there a James Harden and Derek Jones for Zach Levine? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5658.04s)]
*  Anything that excites you? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5664.12s)]
*  No, I don't know that you could have presented anything that [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5668.44s)]
*  be less excited about. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5670.4s)]
*  Just for those that like the, as a trade. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5672.24s)]
*  What, what was the point of that? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5674.24s)]
*  I don't think the Quippers are going to roll into October with [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5676.88s)]
*  the exact same team. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5680.44s)]
*  I'm just not convinced. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5681.92s)]
*  Maybe not, but like, Hey, how about me sticking up for Harden? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5683.08s)]
*  I think you're a little dismissive of just the comfort of, Hey, look, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5687.92s)]
*  it's a little more expensive. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5693.68s)]
*  We probably could have played a hard ball. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5694.76s)]
*  He made all NBA last year. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5696.32s)]
*  He'd probably going to play a ton of games. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5698.28s)]
*  It doesn't even need to be in great shape. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5699.92s)]
*  He's going to put up numbers and it helps us, you know, at least like have something [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5701.48s)]
*  that we can depend on because he's still better than a lot of the players out there. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5708.28s)]
*  And we'll just do that and give them a little bit of a bump. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5712.0s)]
*  And then whatever happens, we can figure this out in 26. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5714.719999999999s)]
*  Like, don't you think, but it's not like they give them a four year contract. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5717.32s)]
*  Can I have a counter? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5721.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I want the counter. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5723.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5725.28s)]
*  So let's say I'm thinking of one of your friends that I've met, Timmy [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5725.599999999999s)]
*  Walsh. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5728.76s)]
*  You guys drive cross country. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5728.84s)]
*  You and Timmy Walsh. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5731.6s)]
*  We thought about doing it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5732.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5733.4400000000005s)]
*  Get Tara gets to Arizona and something horrible happens. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5735.040000000001s)]
*  Like he gets in a, I don't know, some sort of road rage incident or, uh, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5739.96s)]
*  like just a bad driver. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5745.120000000001s)]
*  By the time you get Arizona, you're like, I'm never doing this again with this guy. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5746.64s)]
*  I'm never, never going cross country with them. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5749.84s)]
*  Um, and then you're like, I'm never going to do this again. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5752.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5755.76s)]
*  Um, I think game seven was that bad for Hardin. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5757.16s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5762.2s)]
*  He's not even fazed by these. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5763.0s)]
*  He's got a million. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5764.400000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying he's fazed by these. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5765.04s)]
*  I'm saying if you're the Clippers and your goal is to win the title, this is [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5766.92s)]
*  all Steve Ballmer wants, he built this fucking wall that they, they genuinely, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5770.4800000000005s)]
*  and I think they're right. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5775.8s)]
*  Feel like swung three games. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5776.76s)]
*  They studied all the fan behavior in the wall and flew those people out to Denver. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5779.04s)]
*  Like they're all in. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5783.24s)]
*  They're spending every dollar they possibly can. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5784.2s)]
*  And after watching Hardin in game seven, I just refused to believe with this, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5787.76s)]
*  whatever window they have left with Kawhi that they're like, well, maybe [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5791.96s)]
*  it'll be different this year. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5795.36s)]
*  They're not getting in the car with him again. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5796.72s)]
*  Just like in my Timmy Walsh example, I just want to shout out Timmy Walsh, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5798.2s)]
*  one of my favorite conspiracy people. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5801.72s)]
*  Um, I just don't think they want to get in the car with him for another road trip [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5803.639999999999s)]
*  because they know what's going to happen when they get to Arizona. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5807.72s)]
*  I don't think they care. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5812.44s)]
*  They clearly don't care. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5814.12s)]
*  It's a smart front office. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5815.32s)]
*  They know everything that you just said. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5817.16s)]
*  And I don't think they thought they were going to tax him because of his history [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5819.48s)]
*  in those huge spots because the value over [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5823.32s)]
*  asset that they're there, whatever he's in, they now have them under contract, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5826.24s)]
*  but this allows them to potentially do something. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5830.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5833.28s)]
*  Instead of just, that's my take. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5833.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5835.28s)]
*  Asset management, which is a lot of what we've seen over the last couple of days. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5835.639999999999s)]
*  It's like, Oh, that number seems a little higher. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5839.2s)]
*  No, like that was kind of my overriding thing. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5842.2s)]
*  I know repeating myself from the very top of the podcast, but like there [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5844.12s)]
*  were multiple examples of, they probably could have said, fine, cool. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5846.4800000000005s)]
*  Go to free agency. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5849.96s)]
*  You're never getting anything north of this. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5850.76s)]
*  The agent relationships, the history here, and then the fear of, okay, but [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5853.2s)]
*  now if I lose this piece and ownership is like, Hey, cool. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5858.36s)]
*  Like our, our payroll's lower. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5862.0s)]
*  I mean, Balmer would never do that to them, but it's just, well, we can't [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5864.4s)]
*  just let a bunch of these stuff. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5867.96s)]
*  We can't just let stuff walk and play hardball with everybody. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5869.4s)]
*  And then if there's actually something available in November, December, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5871.92s)]
*  January, February, now we don't even have any of those pieces. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5874.599999999999s)]
*  So yeah, maybe it is as simple as an asset management with just the one year. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5877.12s)]
*  But I do think that you're overlooking a little bit of the, just from October [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5879.76s)]
*  until April, like Harden's probably going to be pretty good for us. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5883.36s)]
*  I. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5887.84s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5888.84s)]
*  I just got, I had to defend James Harden for like three minutes. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5889.5599999999995s)]
*  I've done it twice in my life. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5892.36s)]
*  And that was the second time. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5894.12s)]
*  Felt good. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5895.12s)]
*  What about Westbrook? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5895.76s)]
*  Where's he going? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5896.84s)]
*  I don't know who's left. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5899.2s)]
*  Why you have a team? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5905.4s)]
*  Can't find him. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5907.48s)]
*  I mean, I imagine it'll be one, but. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5908.84s)]
*  I can't find one either. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5911.679999999999s)]
*  Does Brooklyn just say, fuck it for a year? [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5912.5599999999995s)]
*  Is there a world where Reeves gets traded into Atlanta's $25 million [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5915.48s)]
*  trade exception for players and assets? [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5920.24s)]
*  But it has to be one player that makes a huge difference. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5924.88s)]
*  Would you do a Kong Wu and, and some picks for Reeves? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5930.08s)]
*  Would you have a meeting? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5934.48s)]
*  Going, Hey, we got for Zingas and let's keep our fingers crossed. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5937.64s)]
*  And Reeves is a better player than a Kong Wu. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5942.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's a better player. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5945.76s)]
*  He gives us a second creator than with Trey. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5946.32s)]
*  We might be able to patch together the center position. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5949.84s)]
*  We might be able to make a real run here. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5955.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5957.12s)]
*  I just, it was the only thing I can think of with the Lakers where. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5957.44s)]
*  To get a center. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5961.24s)]
*  I think they would have to, that's the only thing that made sense to me. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5962.08s)]
*  And I have a, by the way, please, anyone listening, please don't aggregate [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5966.08s)]
*  these trades and say, please, whatever. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5969.44s)]
*  I'm just throwing dumb shit out. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5972.5199999999995s)]
*  Cause I had a, I had a Jalen one that I'm just not going to do. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5978.64s)]
*  Cause I don't want it to become like one that I really liked. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5981.72s)]
*  I'm just going to tell you offline. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5984.240000000001s)]
*  You know what? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5985.56s)]
*  I'm depriving. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5985.84s)]
*  I'm depriving the people for the pod. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5986.88s)]
*  I hope that gets aggregated. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5988.56s)]
*  Simmons doesn't tell Rossello Jalen Brown trade in fear of aggregation. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5990.52s)]
*  Simmons tells Rossello Jalen Brown trade after podcast. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=5995.160000000001s)]
*  Um, and then I was thinking of available, available trade guys. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6000.280000000001s)]
*  Would you have George last or Beale last right now? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6006.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, Beale. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6010.72s)]
*  So Beale is still number one. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6012.12s)]
*  So that's your number one for two years now. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6013.84s)]
*  That should be some sort of wonder lick like NBA thing. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6016.04s)]
*  Like here, here's a hypothetical. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6018.68s)]
*  You make $50 million a year, but the team hates you and they never play you. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6020.92s)]
*  And you have a no trade clause. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6028.88s)]
*  If that happened to you for two years and you still have like a year left in your [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6030.96s)]
*  contract, what would you want? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6035.320000000001s)]
*  And if you answered like, I'd be totally fine. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6037.160000000001s)]
*  I'm never playing and then keeping all my money. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6039.68s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but you're still going to keep your money. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6042.6s)]
*  Like, would you eventually get sick of this? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6044.0s)]
*  When there'd be some competitive part of you that was like, Hey, I'm a [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6045.64s)]
*  pretty talented player and I don't want to go out like this. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6047.64s)]
*  And if the guy had to combine answers, no, I'm totally fine. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6050.4800000000005s)]
*  It'd be the Beale answer. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6054.04s)]
*  It'd be like, okay, we've got to take this guy off the board. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6055.84s)]
*  We've seen some, we've seen some people in the sports media world. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6058.4800000000005s)]
*  Checkout like that. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6063.64s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6065.4400000000005s)]
*  It's, it's, I love, I love when it happens. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6067.240000000001s)]
*  I love getting to see it. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6069.6s)]
*  I'm just going to get so jealous. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6070.4400000000005s)]
*  Is it tougher for you and I, I think to check out, like I've [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6073.04s)]
*  wanted to check out for years. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6076.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6079.0s)]
*  What's your check out date? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6079.120000000001s)]
*  Like age 58. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6080.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6083.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, whatever that one last deal where you could just completely check out. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6084.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6091.120000000001s)]
*  That'd be fun. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6091.360000000001s)]
*  I don't, I just need more of a team. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6092.68s)]
*  Like the anchors get to check out. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6095.200000000001s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6097.04s)]
*  Because the scripts can be written. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6097.6s)]
*  The segments are produced. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6098.88s)]
*  They'll even have people that produce the questions. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6100.240000000001s)]
*  Formed like, Hey, we have this person like, you know, uh, just make sure [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6102.88s)]
*  you ask that, you know, Alex Bregman's, you know, nine for his last 18, you know? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6107.400000000001s)]
*  And so I think there's, you know, we're trying to carry these podcasts on our own. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6111.160000000001s)]
*  It's a little tougher. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6117.76s)]
*  Like, I think it'd be pretty obvious if you start to realize it, but [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6118.4400000000005s)]
*  because this guy waking up 15 minutes before he does these. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6120.8s)]
*  Can I get, can I ask you for, can I ask you for your take on the dumb team [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6123.56s)]
*  hierarchy now, because I mentioned the dumb teams during the week on the draft. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6128.56s)]
*  Um, and I think it's Sacramento, New Orleans, Brooklyn and Chicago [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6133.4s)]
*  in some order right now. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6138.44s)]
*  That would be my four. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6141.24s)]
*  Is there anybody I'm omitting for you? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6142.36s)]
*  And I think that the qualifier is you have to be from a far gone. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6146.28s)]
*  What the fuck are they doing? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6149.88s)]
*  You have to be from a far gone. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6151.0s)]
*  What the fuck are those guys doing? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6152.4400000000005s)]
*  Cause Chicago is a good example. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6154.0s)]
*  I don't know what that Lonzo ball as a coral trade was. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6156.2s)]
*  Like I just, that was one of those where you're just like, I just [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6159.24s)]
*  don't understand what just happened. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6163.0s)]
*  You already have Patrick Williams. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6165.16s)]
*  Why do you want Isaac Acura? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6166.56s)]
*  Now they're different in, in theory, because of coral, like there's some [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6169.16s)]
*  shooting numbers of people be like, Hey, and you're like, yeah, but that's not [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6172.4800000000005s)]
*  really exactly, he's not really a shooter. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6175.360000000001s)]
*  Um, there's some defensive metrics per 100. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6177.8s)]
*  Like they actually show up pretty good. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6180.44s)]
*  What he brings. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6181.92s)]
*  So you think they can play them together? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6182.4s)]
*  No, no, but I can't, but I can't. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6184.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm saying like a coral just by himself. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6186.639999999999s)]
*  There's a little bit of a discussion at 10 or $11 million, but Cleveland [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6190.599999999999s)]
*  not when you have Patrick Williams. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6194.639999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6196.16s)]
*  And when you're getting rid of Lonzo where you're like, all right, this is [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6196.48s)]
*  an expiring 10 million dollar deal and we're bringing back a coral for a similar [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6199.84s)]
*  number, but then he's 11.8 next year. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6203.04s)]
*  I don't, I'm [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6206.04s)]
*  everyone. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6206.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6207.240000000001s)]
*  How many, I read five stories last year about like, this is the best story in [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6208.56s)]
*  sports. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6212.04s)]
*  Everybody loves Lonzo. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6212.64s)]
*  Amazing teammate. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6214.08s)]
*  I thought he was really fun to play for. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6215.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, for. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6218.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6220.360000000001s)]
*  For the teams. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6221.240000000001s)]
*  So that's our, that's our five right now. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6221.88s)]
*  I remember a GM told me a long time ago. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6224.400000000001s)]
*  I just need seven of these teams. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6227.52s)]
*  And as long as we always have seven, I'll be fine. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6230.200000000001s)]
*  Although if I'll always have somebody. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6235.320000000001s)]
*  So right now it seems like we have five. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6238.0s)]
*  Maybe there's more coming. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6240.84s)]
*  It's sad that the Lakers aren't on this list anymore. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6243.92s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6246.52s)]
*  That's really all I have except, uh, to bend the UFC in Vegas yesterday. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6248.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6252.84s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6253.0s)]
*  Awesome fight. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6253.72s)]
*  Huh? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6254.280000000001s)]
*  Name card. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6254.6s)]
*  Topori is like, I don't, I just don't know. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6257.04s)]
*  I'm too casual of a UFC fan to put him against other guys from the past. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6259.8s)]
*  But that guy's just an animal. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6264.52s)]
*  He's just now he's still undefeated. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6267.88s)]
*  I don't, he moved up in weight, which sometimes can go one way or the other, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6270.28s)]
*  more in boxing than UFC. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6274.400000000001s)]
*  But I mean, Wow. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6276.76s)]
*  It just, he just has it, man. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6281.16s)]
*  You know, the guy is at the final level when they have the knockout and they're [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6282.96s)]
*  not fazed at all by it, they just kind of walk over and like, they want to like [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6286.6s)]
*  wave to Dana White, like they just knock somebody out that they'd been trained [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6290.52s)]
*  in a fight for three months. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6293.84s)]
*  And it's like, they went and got a latte. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6295.6s)]
*  That's when you know, it's like something really crazy, but he's, he's, I think [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6297.88s)]
*  he's the biggest star they have right now. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6301.72s)]
*  They haven't been able to blow him up as a star. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6304.4800000000005s)]
*  Like he's not anywhere remotely close to Connor domestically, internationally, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6307.04s)]
*  maybe, but I think he's the guy right now. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6311.64s)]
*  How into it has been. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6316.400000000001s)]
*  He was really bummed out last night because he likes Charles. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6319.52s)]
*  Him and his, him and his friend Enzo, uh, really took it hard. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6322.799999999999s)]
*  They just like them. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6327.16s)]
*  They didn't want to see him. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6327.799999999999s)]
*  They, they, they had slim expectations. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6328.96s)]
*  They didn't want to see what happened, happened where he just got [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6332.32s)]
*  fucking his clock cleaned. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6335.2s)]
*  They were not happy. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6337.88s)]
*  Um, but that we have a new Simmons family as a new guy though. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6339.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6345.36s)]
*  Joshua van won us over completely. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6346.28s)]
*  Just an incredible performance by him. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6349.36s)]
*  Did you see that fight? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6351.32s)]
*  It was the first fight. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6351.96s)]
*  Did you see it last night? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6352.72s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6353.88s)]
*  I, uh, I know I took the boat out. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6354.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6359.28s)]
*  Took the boat out late and then you'll, I don't know if you'd be proud or disappointed. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6360.4800000000005s)]
*  I actually think you're going to be disappointed, but I was like, Hey, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6365.8s)]
*  lighter schedule, not a ton of prep. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6369.0s)]
*  You're on this. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6371.6s)]
*  Like I can go out for a little bit. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6372.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6374.0s)]
*  You know, cause I won't drink on the boat. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6374.32s)]
*  Cause I got to dock that thing. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6375.88s)]
*  I just don't want to, I don't want to ever have like, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6377.4s)]
*  there's been one or two bad incidents over the years with boats and [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6379.92s)]
*  alcohol that I've read about. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6383.24s)]

*  Don't even give yourself a chance. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6414.360000000001s)]
*  Like you have to go out. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6415.360000000001s)]
*  You have to go out tonight. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6416.16s)]

*  I looked at my bed and I went, Nope. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6421.24s)]
*  Like the window was three minutes. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6425.88s)]
*  There was like a three minute window where I was like, I'm doing it. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6427.400000000001s)]

*  I'm going out. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6431.16s)]
*  That's an official sign. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6431.88s)]
*  You're moving in a different phase of life. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6433.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6434.88s)]
*  But that's been happening a lot. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6435.04s)]
*  Like there's a lot of, depending on how the week works out, cause I don't go out [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6436.5199999999995s)]
*  very often, but they'll still be like, don't become a guy who just never ever [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6439.639999999999s)]
*  does it and I'll, I'll get up and like my day will be going great. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6443.4s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6449.12s)]
*  I'm in great mood, whatever, whatever. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6449.759999999999s)]
*  And then you just know like, Hey, I ate, it's shutting down. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6451.799999999999s)]
*  I want to work out tomorrow. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6454.639999999999s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6456.16s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6456.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not missing anything. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6457.0s)]
*  And then I just, I had this like peak energy, like spike where I just went, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6458.24s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to do this, like fight through this thing. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6462.719999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, you got that brine on you day at sea and it, it takes it [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6465.68s)]
*  out of you, you know, my stepdad's big boat guy. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6471.64s)]
*  Um, it's a, it's a lot of work. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6479.280000000001s)]
*  It's, it's really like separates the men from the boys in the sense of, it's [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6482.240000000001s)]
*  not just like getting a car, like you really, if you're going to do it, you [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6485.88s)]
*  got to do it clean. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6488.92s)]
*  You got to, there's just some real thought and care. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6491.360000000001s)]
*  It's like adopting, adopting a dog. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6494.68s)]
*  Like if you adopt the dog, it's like, Hey, I adopt the dog. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6497.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like, okay, your life's going to be different now. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6499.320000000001s)]
*  This dog's always going to be around. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6502.64s)]
*  You're always going to have to figure out what to do with it. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6503.88s)]
*  The boat is kind of like the dog. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6505.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6508.96s)]
*  At least I can, I don't feel bad leaving it. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6509.160000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6511.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6512.280000000001s)]
*  Where I think some people are going away, somebody's got to watch my dog, but you [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6512.76s)]
*  still have to put in this extra time into it, right? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6516.64s)]
*  That I don't think people realize when they don't get it until they get a boat. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6520.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6523.52s)]
*  I think if it's, if it's on your, like you have a lake or something or the people [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6523.68s)]
*  down in Newport beach where they have docks in the backyard, that's sick. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6527.08s)]
*  You know, you don't have to hose it down immediately, although it would be nice. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6532.72s)]
*  You know, you don't want that salt to build, but when you have to go into [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6535.28s)]
*  Marina and you know, the check-in and all that kind of stuff, and then get the [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6538.4800000000005s)]
*  thing untied and I'm, I did it by myself too. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6541.36s)]
*  So there's always a little extra of just being like on it, on it, on it, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6543.6s)]
*  every time you have to do it. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6548.12s)]
*  So then I got really artsy though, instead of watching fights, I watched [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6548.96s)]
*  Casablanca really you guys doing that. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6552.88s)]
*  The rewatchables. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6556.72s)]
*  Cause I'm ready. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6557.400000000001s)]
*  You're ready for Casablanca. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6559.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6560.96s)]
*  It's considered the greatest screenplay ever written. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6562.2s)]
*  I listen, that sounds like an amazing idea for the summer for us. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6565.08s)]
*  It's on the list. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6568.24s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6570.96s)]
*  It kind of lives on now in when Harry met Sally because it has like these two big [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6571.400000000001s)]
*  parts of when Harry met Sally for, so for like the under 40 generation, unless [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6575.92s)]
*  you, you know, your parents like force you to watch it or tell you to watch it [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6580.64s)]
*  or whatever, um, it came out in that, what was it? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6583.88s)]
*  1942? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6587.280000000001s)]
*  Great recall. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6588.92s)]
*  1943. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6590.160000000001s)]
*  1943. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6591.76s)]
*  So that's now 83 years ago. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6592.84s)]
*  Like think how long that is. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6595.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6598.0s)]
*  And so it's nuts. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6598.64s)]
*  Like Jaws is 50 years old though. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6599.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6602.400000000001s)]
*  Shout out to the vineyard. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6602.6s)]
*  Speaking of boats. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6604.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, you know what? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6606.08s)]
*  It's a big Jaws summer. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6606.92s)]
*  I was going to call you in for prestige TV because Amazon has the show set on [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6608.84s)]
*  Martha's vineyard. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6613.36s)]
*  It's a YA show, but it's just, my daughter was out at 20 minutes. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6614.44s)]
*  So I didn't tell you about it. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6618.4s)]
*  But yeah, fully vineyard. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6620.76s)]
*  Like they went all in. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6622.92s)]
*  Do you know the name of it? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6624.48s)]
*  Because I forget where I was. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6625.24s)]
*  It was kind of like one of those deals where you can't find the remote in a [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6626.72s)]
*  hotel room. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6630.04s)]
*  So that means the channel is just not going to be changed forever. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6630.84s)]
*  And looking as you're talking, there was this crime. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6633.8s)]
*  Series that takes place on Martha's vineyard. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6638.2s)]
*  It's all shot in Canada. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6641.12s)]
*  And I think even the actors are Canadian, but I think the true story behind it is [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6642.36s)]
*  that it's these fictional books where all of these things take place on Martha's [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6646.68s)]
*  vineyard because the author's father, father-in-law uncle or something was [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6650.72s)]
*  actually a police chief in Egger town. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6654.72s)]
*  So I could be sort of mauling this, but I don't know if it was the same thing. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6656.72s)]
*  So I ended up watching. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6661.16s)]
*  I never watch that kind of stuff, but I was like, all right, I got to see what [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6662.32s)]
*  happens here. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6665.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6666.72s)]
*  Well, my, my daughter's home right now. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6666.88s)]
*  So I, I can't say I'm watching like, I'm not watching a ton of stuff. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6668.72s)]
*  I can't, Oh, it's called, we were liars. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6674.28s)]
*  I have not seen that. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6676.88s)]
*  You might want to give it a test run for the Martha's vineyard footage. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6679.04s)]
*  I will. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6683.32s)]
*  No, I'm in, I'm totally in, but I would tell younger people that are listening [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6683.88s)]
*  about Casablanca, like don't give it too hard of a time on the action scene at [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6687.4s)]
*  the end. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6690.599999999999s)]
*  And I think Bogart, I think that's an over, under a four, four and a half. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6691.84s)]
*  Here's looking at you kids. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6696.6s)]
*  Like you might, I don't know if you get away with that today. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6697.76s)]
*  I'm ready to like two of them. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6702.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6703.64s)]
*  You know, like Bruce Willis has said, you know, Yippee ki-yay motherfucker, five [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6705.24s)]
*  times and diehard. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6711.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6713.08s)]
*  They tacked it on and diehard three. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6713.44s)]
*  We just did that one. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6715.08s)]
*  I do think about people like Bogart sometimes, like when I work on rewatch [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6716.8s)]
*  the balls and you think about how famous these people were, like when we do [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6720.48s)]
*  movies from the seventies and Redford and Newman and like, they were just so, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6723.44s)]
*  so famous and they still are famous because there's a lot of people. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6728.759999999999s)]
*  But then when you go way back and you go to like, sir Lawrence Oliver, this is [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6731.719999999999s)]
*  the reason I was thinking about it. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6735.919999999999s)]
*  Cause he's a marathon man. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6736.839999999999s)]
*  We did that one. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6738.32s)]
*  And he's one of the most famous actors in the world. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6739.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6742.719999999999s)]
*  And he was married to Vivian Lee, who was the lady in Gone with the Wind. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6743.16s)]
*  And it was like one great stage actor was dead by like 54. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6746.92s)]
*  And I was thinking like Vivian Lee, probably one of the two, three biggest [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6750.84s)]
*  actresses for 20 years, right? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6755.4800000000005s)]
*  No longer discussed. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6757.4400000000005s)]
*  Not in the mix in 2025 and there's no conversations. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6760.12s)]
*  Like there's some sort of shelf life for when you're just not discussed anymore. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6763.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6768.400000000001s)]
*  Ava Gardner. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6768.68s)]
*  Um, you go, like, I don't know what it is. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6770.2s)]
*  Like the Mariska Hargitay has this documentary now about Jane Mansfield. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6772.2s)]
*  Who probably not discussed unless there's documentary, but it does make you think [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6777.0s)]
*  like, all right, I'm going to die someday. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6780.36s)]
*  And then everybody's going to forget who you were. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6781.88s)]
*  Not you. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6784.16s)]
*  They'll be, no, they'll bring it forget. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6784.88s)]
*  Maybe five years after they'll be a doc. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6786.84s)]
*  Chris Ryan's going to be old in a rocking chair and be like, he wasn't the [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6789.72s)]
*  easiest to get along with, but it was worth it. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6792.56s)]
*  They've been a lot of people like Bill was bill. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6795.88s)]
*  But they say my name twice. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6798.6s)]
*  You know, Bill was bill. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6800.4400000000005s)]
*  Uh, like the main Ramirez corner. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6802.16s)]
*  So Casablanca, that's your recommendation. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6805.76s)]
*  And it is, it's, it is pretty cool. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6808.16s)]
*  Like when you think about, all right, Bogart is this mysterious guy who's. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6810.64s)]
*  In occupied, you know, Africa and yet there's a dueling the Vici and you've [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6816.88s)]
*  got the Nazis and he's kind of his own man. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6823.92s)]
*  He's almost like this Han Solo type. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6826.32s)]
*  And it's Bogart who's not exactly the most dashing guy ever. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6829.04s)]
*  And yet I was reading about him after the fact, cause I was trying to figure [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6833.16s)]
*  out like, if there's a biography that it was worth, I'm sure there's plenty [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6836.24s)]
*  of really good ones, but like for me to do a biography on somebody, I'm like, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6838.76s)]
*  I don't really like doing that all that much anymore. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6841.599999999999s)]
*  But then the Duke of all people, John Wayne being like, that was the leading [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6843.84s)]
*  man that like I thought about when I pursued my career, like to your point, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6848.48s)]
*  like you can say, Hey man, Bogart was really famous. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6854.04s)]
*  And I remember like the first time I saw the African queen, it was like, you [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6856.96s)]
*  know, moving my parents wouldn't turn off or something when I was a really [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6859.28s)]
*  young kid being like this movie sucks. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6861.56s)]
*  But then even as a kid, I kept, cause you know, we didn't have any channels [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6863.120000000001s)]
*  back then, it was just on TV. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6865.76s)]
*  I think there were three channels. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6866.84s)]
*  And even as a kid, I was like, man, this African queen's like kind of crazy. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6868.4400000000005s)]
*  Like this is a crazy movie and he's so good at being the perfect, like, you [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6872.52s)]
*  know, she would have never thought she'd be with him. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6877.92s)]
*  Now a lot of the standard kind of like rulemaking that you have in storytelling. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6880.280000000001s)]
*  And there is something to Casablanca that certainly, you know, holds up in [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6883.92s)]
*  the sense that it wasn't just this super simple, straightforward love story [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6888.76s)]
*  of will they or won't they. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6893.0s)]
*  And with the backdrop of him owning his cafe and everything, it was just cool. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6895.12s)]
*  I hadn't seen it in like forever. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6898.16s)]
*  And so, yeah, we're really funny. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6901.24s)]
*  How I wish I w I watched Sabrina a couple of months ago with Audrey Hepburn. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6902.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6908.64s)]
*  That's the one they did on the vineyard with Harrison Ford. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6908.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6911.320000000001s)]
*  They redid it. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6911.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6912.56s)]
*  This was the original one. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6912.96s)]
*  Tons of shout outs today. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6914.2s)]
*  Um, that movie is just when you watch it, like just through the context of now, but [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6915.92s)]
*  when they made it back then, it's kind of amazing. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6922.5599999999995s)]
*  And just the premise of it, it's just like great story. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6925.36s)]
*  Two brothers. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6927.92s)]
*  She was always where her family worked for this super rich family. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6929.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6933.04s)]
*  But it was had a crush. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6933.48s)]
*  She would have had a crush on one of the brothers. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6934.599999999999s)]
*  He never realized it. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6936.679999999999s)]
*  Was it kind of cocktail? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6937.88s)]
*  She went away. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6939.679999999999s)]
*  She went away to, and then came back a woman and the brother didn't [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6940.32s)]
*  realize it was her. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6943.8s)]
*  And then loved her, but he was kind of a Rube. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6945.4s)]
*  It was like, I was like, this is just, they fucking nailed it with this. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6947.36s)]
*  Every piece of it is just really smart. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6950.76s)]
*  It's going to be a real art house summer over here. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6952.96s)]
*  Cause I watched Lawrence of Arabia a couple of weeks ago and you know, I don't [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6955.32s)]
*  know what's going on with me, but I was like, I'm just, just going to start [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6960.44s)]
*  running through all of these, like all time classics. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6962.76s)]
*  Uh, well they became classics for a reason. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6966.8s)]
*  You know, it's like the Godfather and Jaws and moves like those [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6968.92s)]
*  moves are fucking incredible. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6972.599999999999s)]
*  That's why they became classics. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6973.8s)]
*  Peter O'Toole though, laying on a little thick, dialed it up a little bit. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6975.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6979.84s)]
*  I want to hear that. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6982.4s)]
*  The guys were very, very over the top. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6983.76s)]
*  Well, they were a lot of theater guys. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6986.04s)]
*  So I would love a Lawrence of Arabia rewatchables. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6987.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't want to be on it. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6991.0s)]
*  I want it to be UCR and fantasy. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6991.92s)]
*  And I would love to hear just CR breaking down O'Toole's passion. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6994.28s)]
*  Really going for it. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6998.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6999.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I think we're, we're doing a, we did after hours. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=6999.8s)]
*  That's coming to Monday. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7003.24s)]
*  And then I think we're doing jaws too. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7005.2s)]
*  Ironically, another vineyard shadow. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7007.12s)]
*  That's the next one. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7011.320000000001s)]
*  The vineyard is on fire right now. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7012.04s)]
*  You don't have any jaws, two thoughts. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7014.12s)]
*  I don't. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7021.96s)]
*  Try this one. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7023.88s)]
*  Do it. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7024.360000000001s)]
*  He wouldn't be in. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7024.76s)]
*  Which was the terrible one? [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7025.88s)]
*  Three. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7027.12s)]
*  Which was the terrible one? [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7028.12s)]
*  Three. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7029.400000000001s)]
*  Just three. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7029.92s)]
*  It was for 3d. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7032.320000000001s)]
*  Three was 3d. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7034.360000000001s)]
*  It was jaws 3d. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7035.360000000001s)]
*  That makes more sense. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7036.68s)]
*  There's been two areas of movies when they got really excited about 3d. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7037.4400000000005s)]
*  That this is the next thing. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7042.8s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7044.320000000001s)]
*  3d. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7044.96s)]
*  And then people are like, nah, this kind of sucks. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7045.64s)]
*  They tried it again. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7048.52s)]
*  Um, we're wrapping up. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7050.92s)]
*  So we're back next Sunday. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7053.24s)]
*  Do you think, what do you think the, if you had to make one prediction for the [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7054.320000000001s)]
*  biggest thing that will happen in the seven days before we see each other again? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQjXScGWcS8&t=7057.08s)]
