# 2025 NBA Lottery Karma Rankings: Who Deserves Cooper Flagg The Most? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo)
*  lottery karma rankings. I did, I used to do this as a column once upon a time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=0.0s)]
*  I did not send you my list. I was just going to go through it and have it react. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'll read you the teams with the odds and their top four odds and basically come [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=11.52s)]
*  down to who I think should win from a karma standpoint for the lottery. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=18.52s)]
*  All right. So what does that entail? What does that mean? Karma for a lot. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=23.76s)]
*  It doesn't mean. Yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=27.84s)]
*  Did you behave the right way as an organization and a basketball team? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=30.72s)]
*  Did you bastardize your season? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=35.08s)]
*  Ethical tanking. What are you saying? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=37.56s)]
*  Have you won in the past? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=40.64s)]
*  Have you already been given a bunch of lottery carrots? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=42.72s)]
*  This is your Cleveland point. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=46.36s)]
*  This is the Cleveland point. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=47.96s)]
*  When you lost your shit on TV. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=48.92s)]
*  Cleveland won the lottery three times in four years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=49.32s)]
*  It was fucking ludicrous. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=51.68s)]
*  I, by the way, just a quick aside, when you would lose your mind to a non-receptive [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=53.84s)]
*  audience on TV, I enjoyed it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=61.36s)]
*  Because you weren't really even talking to anybody. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  I don't even know if you were talking, you were just so mad. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=64.16s)]
*  Like it shouldn't happen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=66.84s)]
*  Everybody's just staring at me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  Are you just doing the right thing as an organization? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=73.04s)]
*  Are you on a good run? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=76.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=78.72s)]
*  Do you deserve it basically because you're just doing the right things. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=79.12s)]
*  You're making good decisions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=82.72s)]
*  You're picking good players. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=83.84s)]
*  Maybe you made a good trade. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=85.52s)]
*  Don't lie. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=86.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=88.52s)]
*  So anyway, my number one team for the lottery karma rankings, drum roll, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=90.52s)]
*  praise the Houston Rockets. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=94.96s)]
*  They have a 3.8% odds to win the number one pick and 17.3 to win the top, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=98.56s)]
*  uh, getting the top four. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=104.32s)]
*  They got the pick from that Brooklyn trade they have. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=106.12s)]
*  So this is basically Phoenix's pick. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=109.64s)]
*  And, uh, I still, to this day, didn't really love the James Harden trade that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  much that they made for Brooklyn, but it turned out fine, but they've made a lot [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=117.24s)]
*  of good draft picks and they've set themselves up in a really nice way. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  I even like the Shangoon green contracts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  They did. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=125.6s)]
*  I'm interested to see what they do this summer. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=126.6s)]
*  And I think I've ever in the lottery, they've earned the right to say like, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  you know what, we've just done it the right way here the last couple of years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=133.12s)]
*  So that'd be my first pick your reaction. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=139.68s)]
*  Um, hard to argue when we go based on your criteria. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=140.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  Number two, by the way, what if Houston gets the top four, they become a content [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=150.68s)]
*  machine for the ringer and for our pods content machine, I thought we were going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=157.88s)]
*  to do 30 minutes of Yannis to the thunder today. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=163.92s)]
*  Oh, don't think I didn't have it written down for alternate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=166.44000000000003s)]
*  No, it was like, shit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Like this is now, this is now happening. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  Um, is for Reeves. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=179.88000000000002s)]
*  Can I give you some Yannis Intel? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  Please do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  Everyone in Milwaukee thinks he's coming back. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  Now granted the weeks pass and you never know, but, um, I don't think [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=186.96s)]
*  they're expecting a trade request. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=193.4s)]
*  Can I ask you a follow? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=195.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=197.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=197.68s)]
*  Say the thunder were to lose. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=199.68s)]
*  Impressy calls. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=203.28s)]
*  It's like, okay, I'm just going to, I'm going to crank up our ceiling. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Would it behoove the bucks? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=207.96s)]
*  Which I've said from the beginning, if Yannis goes, Hey, I'm fine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  Then you just keep them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=212.24s)]
*  And if it means you're going to lose, you're going to lose. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  Then you just keep them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=215.24s)]
*  And if it means you win 50 games, you trade them without even asking them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=216.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  Go. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=221.0s)]
*  I don't want to do this again. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=223.36s)]
*  Who do I get him from? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=225.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=226.24s)]
*  Say Hongren has to be in it, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=226.52s)]
*  He has to be in it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  Not hanging up unless he's in it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=231.0s)]
*  Well, you need good players because of the draft stuff that you laid out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=232.44s)]
*  Hongren has to be in the trade. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, I imagine you have to get somebody good. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=238.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=240.36s)]
*  So would you rather have Chet than Jaylen Williams? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=240.72s)]
*  Oh, I'd rather have Chet. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=243.32s)]
*  I would rather have Chet too. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=247.4s)]
*  I'm very excited about Chet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=248.56s)]
*  I'd like him to be a little more confident in that three if he misses a couple of early [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=249.68s)]
*  ones, but you know, we can get there at the end of this round. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=252.44s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=254.32s)]
*  What is he? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=255.16s)]
*  20? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=255.68s)]
*  Is he 22, 23? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=256.08s)]
*  I'm a big Chet fan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=257.84s)]
*  That I think the only thing that worries me is the, the, he's had two injuries [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=259.64s)]
*  already and now granted it's like, wow, but I just, yeah, injured big guys make [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=262.8s)]
*  me nervous. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=267.24s)]
*  My next one. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  Body fat of 6%. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=269.52s)]
*  My number two team in the lottery karma rankings, the Washington wizards, 14% odds for number one, 52.1 to be in the top four. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=271.08s)]
*  And first of all, I liked their draft last year. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=285.96s)]
*  They've changed their organization around. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't think they've been like crazy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=291.56s)]
*  Just funny. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=292.92s)]
*  I even kind of liked the Jordan pool trade looking back like fine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=293.28s)]
*  Um, especially if you're tanking. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=297.2s)]
*  This is more selfish. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=298.32s)]
*  We need more good players in the East and you and I need more good players in the 4pm PT games. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  I just feel like we're late. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=307.56s)]
*  I can't watch the pistons all 82. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=309.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=311.36s)]
*  What are we going to do is we get the pistons, some Celtic games, like we just [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=311.6s)]
*  think I've watched enough Atlanta. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=316.08s)]
*  Need to beef up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=317.48s)]
*  We need to beef up those, that crew. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=318.64s)]
*  Um, and I just feel like I liked the way they've handled the last couple of years. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=321.28s)]
*  So that was a strong number two, your reaction. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=327.08s)]
*  Like that one in the past a couple of times, at least there feels like there's a plan and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=331.28s)]
*  direction and with winger is a stud. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=335.32s)]
*  Everybody's talked about the stuff he did at OKC, but he's done with the Clippers. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  So he is, uh, he's a guy that I know privately that I would, I guess I'm saying it publicly. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=342.88s)]
*  Like if the wizards end up with it, good for him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=349.0s)]
*  Good for winger. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=352.08s)]
*  Good for this fan base. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Good for winger. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  Good for this fan base. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  Cause you know, no one's that fan base. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  That was a fun team that you never took that seriously, but it's kind of a sneaky, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=360.68s)]
*  awesome fan base and they have had, they have had nothing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=365.8s)]
*  They've had like, think about the caps. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=370.16s)]
*  Think about the commanders. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=372.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=373.68s)]
*  Those are, those are some of the best fan bases in their respective sport and this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  basketball team, like going back to Jeff Malone and, you know, when they had Ruland, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=378.12s)]
*  Frank Robinson, that terrible, terrible 1986 trade with the Sixers. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=384.2s)]
*  But it was a team that you're always like, Oh, you know, they may bring it tonight. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=389.44s)]
*  And it was, I don't know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=393.84s)]
*  They always felt like a little bit more on the radar. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  And this is a very, very long time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  Um, you know, flirtation with the Westbrook Beal run that year, uh, when Beal probably [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  showed us enough of like, Oh, is that guy going to be a dude that checks out on the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  team? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=408.84s)]
*  Um, yeah, I think it's a really, cause I think of the fan base too. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=409.56s)]
*  I think of the fan base a little bit and what they deserve. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=413.0s)]
*  And I think that fan base is long overdue for some good news. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=415.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=418.44s)]
*  They won wall. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=418.56s)]
*  The last really fun team that seemed like they had a chance to maybe make the finals [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=419.56s)]
*  was that 2017 team that lost to, uh, the one and only Kelly Olynyk. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  Um, they had a fun arenas run there for about a split second in the mid 2000s. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=428.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=434.4s)]
*  And they had a fun split second with C-Web and Juwan and Rod Strickland and whatever [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=434.96s)]
*  that was, even though they got swept in round one, people remember it fondly now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=439.52s)]
*  But think about this, like think about what you're reaching for. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=442.8s)]
*  I know for, listen, I've known house since 1988 and he's never had any, we're [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=446.08s)]
*  remotely approaching Cooper flag. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  The best players he's had since I've known him, which is two thirds of my life. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=454.56s)]
*  Now we're Bernard King in the 1990, uh, C-Web, the, the not washed up, but getting [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=458.64s)]
*  there, Mitch Richmond, and then arenas and then Bradley Beal and wall. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=468.84s)]
*  So anyway, I have them second number three, Portland, real quick. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=474.32s)]
*  I'm putting you on the spot. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=478.12s)]
*  What do you think their highest win total was in the eighties? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=479.12s)]
*  Oh, I don't definitely not in the fifties, probably like 45 and 37. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  That's why you're the, that's why you're the best. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=487.32s)]
*  Who's that? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=489.92s)]
*  What a West 43 39 in 1982. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=490.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=494.24s)]
*  They've been horrible. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=494.36s)]
*  They won the 78 title and that was almost 50 years ago. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=496.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=502.32s)]
*  So third one, they won the title so long ago that the team that they beat has not [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  been in their city for 20 years. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=508.12s)]
*  That's how long it's been number three, 48 games that year too. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=509.8s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=513.08s)]
*  40, no one odds for Portland, 3.8 top four 16.9. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=514.16s)]
*  Uh, the reasons here, the Dame trade was the right trade. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=518.04s)]
*  I think they get rewarded for that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=522.48s)]
*  The Optia trade was probably the sneaky move of the summer last year. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  We're still in it with our guys scoot. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=528.12s)]
*  I like their weird collection assets. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=529.76s)]
*  The billups coaching higher turned out to be pretty good. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=531.48s)]
*  I think they extended him and it's arrow pointing up in a lot of ways. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=534.52s)]
*  So it'd be a good spot for Cooper flag. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  I like it except for, I just feel like. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  Does that diminish scoot star or does it lift him? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  All your arguments for both. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=553.12s)]
*  It gets tough after the top three, we're still up for the lottery. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=554.3599999999999s)]
*  Karma rankings. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=557.2399999999999s)]
*  So you think it's a clear tier one of those three teams that have done [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=558.0s)]
*  it, that deserve it done it the right way. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  Houston, Washington, Portland, fourth one, Utah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=563.88s)]
*  Number one odds 14%. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=569.0s)]
*  They have the best there in the one spot. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=570.76s)]
*  So even if a couple of teams jump them, they'll still be there. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=573.44s)]
*  Six teams have never had the first pick in the draft. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=577.56s)]
*  Can you name them? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=580.64s)]
*  Uh, Utah is one of them. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=583.84s)]
*  So there's a hint. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=585.04s)]
*  Utah, uh, Toronto. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=586.84s)]
*  No, they had it with Barney. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=589.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=591.64s)]
*  El Magico. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=592.68s)]
*  It's a really hard question. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=594.2s)]
*  It is a tough question. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=596.52s)]
*  It is a tough question. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=598.36s)]
*  Has Dallas ever had it? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=599.48s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=601.0s)]
*  They have Mark. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=602.56s)]
*  McGuire. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll give you the six, the Denver nuggets, the Indiana Pacers, the Memphis Grizzlies. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  Who, um, famously came one spot away from LeBron James 2003. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=614.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=623.0799999999999s)]
*  One of the great lottery reactions of all time. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=623.24s)]
*  Miami heat have never had the number one pick in the Oklahoma city [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=626.12s)]
*  thunder have somehow never had the number one pick. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=629.08s)]
*  So Utah, they took care of Will Hardy, which I appreciated. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=633.72s)]
*  They gave him a contract till 2031. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=637.72s)]
*  Like, sorry, dude, sorry. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=640.08s)]
*  We had to make you do that the last two years. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=641.24s)]
*  Their owner has been great. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=643.64s)]
*  I think he's probably the best kind of new wave owner. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=645.48s)]
*  The league's brought in in the last 10 years, but they did. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  They did really tank. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=654.0s)]
*  Pretty aggressively. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=656.2s)]
*  Um, but I think it would be fun to have flag go this team. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to overlook some stuff with them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=661.48s)]
*  I have them fourth. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=663.24s)]
*  Your reaction. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=665.32s)]
*  I believe they should be in tier one. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=666.84s)]
*  I mean, we sit here, we want to play the tanking game and say the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  Wizards did it the right way. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=670.88s)]
*  And then Utah did it the wrong way. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure plenty of basketball people would agree with you, but look, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=673.24s)]
*  Mitchell was going to want out. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=677.72s)]
*  They cleaned up on the Rudy thing. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=679.32s)]
*  They hit reset on a team that, you know, we just pointed out earlier in the pod. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=681.1600000000001s)]
*  Remember when they won all those games and it was a 59 win profile team. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=685.48s)]
*  And then immediately they're like, Hey boys, this is the playoffs. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=689.08s)]
*  It's going to, it's not going to translate like it does for other teams. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=691.36s)]
*  You know, sometimes you regularly see in the playoff. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  Uh, I think the most important part of this, you've got me on whatever tier of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=695.64s)]
*  ethical tanking you have these teams rank through, but as far as what Utah needs. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=701.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=707.4s)]
*  What they need is a guy that may want to actually stay in Utah for 10 years. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=708.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=713.44s)]
*  I think the only way they're ever going to get somebody who's a [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=714.36s)]
*  franchise changing player is to get a Cooper flag in the draft. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=717.56s)]
*  They're not going to be a destination for free agency, even though I've [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=721.96s)]
*  heard Ryan Smith, the owner like laid it out like, Hey, we're not small market. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=724.68s)]
*  Like, look how great all these things. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=728.4s)]
*  I think if you're a simple guy, you'd actually like to play in Salt Lake. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=730.64s)]
*  I think Salt Lake's oddly confusing to a lot of different people. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=735.16s)]
*  Like it's just, it's, it's kind of more convenient than Denver. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=738.28s)]
*  Salt Lake's awesome. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=741.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=743.08s)]
*  I'm buying Salt Lake stock. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  I am with you. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=745.44s)]
*  I'm buying a hockey team. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=746.36s)]
*  They don't have a cool like Denver. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=748.04s)]
*  So that's a positive got rid of Sundance. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that helps the cap. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  That's out. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=754.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  Sundance going to Boulder. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=755.88s)]
*  Never made it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=759.08s)]
*  Um, maybe. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=762.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=763.84s)]
*  I'm, I'm happy to consider them being in tier one because I, the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=764.12s)]
*  will hardy thing made me bad mad. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=768.84s)]
*  Cause I think he's a really good coach and you just removed two years of like, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=770.48s)]
*  imagine if you, like when you came to work for us in 2018, if I was like, yo, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=774.2s)]
*  first two years, I'm going to need you to really just like fuck up the first 15 [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=781.5600000000001s)]
*  minutes of your podcast, cause we need the downloads to be down and then you can [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=786.32s)]
*  try and try some stuff, but I don't really want it to be good yet, but 2021, I [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=790.84s)]
*  really want the pot to be good. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=796.84s)]
*  So just kind of. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  So you'd say, Hey, we want to suppress your value. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=799.8s)]
*  No, don't try. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=802.72s)]
*  This is a terrible analogy. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=803.72s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=805.0s)]
*  I'm just trying, but imagine being in the, being in the position of like, don't do [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=805.88s)]
*  your best. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=810.44s)]
*  Hey, we're not going to be ways to win this game. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=812.32s)]
*  Don't use them. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=814.68s)]
*  We're going to have to have you to do everything still over the phone. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=816.16s)]
*  This whole zoom thing you're seeing on the other shows. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=819.32s)]
*  Moving to video, just two more years, audio only. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=821.24s)]
*  Um, well, I mean, I just think that sucks. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=826.0s)]
*  To be like, this is how I have to coach. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=828.76s)]
*  Like my organization doesn't want me to win, but we both agree. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=831.76s)]
*  That's what you have to do when you're Utah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=835.48s)]
*  You have to play it that way. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=837.36s)]
*  It's just a thing about the league. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=839.04s)]
*  If you're trained for somebody, you know, that's probably a small target of like [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  who gets traded for that's a franchise changing player. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=845.12s)]
*  That's like, I'm here and I want to stay. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=848.08s)]
*  You're probably not going to be able to use your cap space on anybody. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=850.56s)]
*  So you need somebody to come through, which I think this is a great [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=853.8s)]
*  organization, whether it's ownership, age, Xanax, Hardy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=856.52s)]
*  I am probably a little too, like I would do wonder if Hardy in a private moment [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=860.36s)]
*  with a, with a beer with a couple of friends says, well, it looks like I'm not [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=864.6s)]
*  catching Popovich anytime soon, right? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=867.84s)]
*  Cause all of those numbers are, when you pull up his basketball reference, it's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=869.84s)]
*  like, that's what my winning percentage is. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's what my record says it is. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=875.44s)]
*  Uh, you could also argue too. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=877.16s)]
*  It's like, we're going to give you this shot at a very young age to be this coach. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=878.64s)]
*  And maybe there's a different path. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=883.36s)]
*  You're stuck in as a second or third assistant somewhere else, and you don't [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=884.76s)]
*  even get this opportunity until seven or eight years later, the Spurs coach. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=888.04s)]
*  It, my argument for Utah and why I want them to win the lottery is this Cooper [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=891.8s)]
*  flag in Salt Lake would be the most important piece for a franchise that needs [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=896.84s)]
*  it, considering all the challenges that they have faced historically in transactions. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=904.6s)]
*  I'll move them up to tier four, tier one. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=909.48s)]
*  You, you sold me. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=911.56s)]
*  I think Washington would have a same kind of impact though. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=912.76s)]
*  I think he's a game changer for them. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  They've never had a player come in who is like, and I'm going to make everyone [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=918.4799999999999s)]
*  better on this team guy in the last 40 years, right? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=922.88s)]
*  That, which is what we think he is. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=925.88s)]
*  Do you think you have a Jordan pool quote? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=927.68s)]
*  They're like, this guy's going to be all right off the bench, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=929.1199999999999s)]
*  like Twan about Pierce. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=932.4799999999999s)]
*  Turn the pulls like, I can't wait to teach him everything I know. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=934.16s)]
*  Um, all right. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=937.3199999999999s)]
*  Next one is Brooklyn. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=938.88s)]
*  Their number one odds are 9.9% top four, 37%. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=940.64s)]
*  You know, they sabotaged year one of the Jordy era. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=945.52s)]
*  They might've been like a 38, 30, they might've been a play in team and they [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=949.08s)]
*  were just like, no way. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=953.44s)]
*  So I got to ding them for that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=954.48s)]
*  But, uh, you know, they've been all over the map. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=956.0s)]
*  Sean marks, I guess can just never get fired, but the, uh, the KG trade [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=958.52s)]
*  turned out to be just a grand slam. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  So you almost like get rewarded for that, right? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=965.84s)]
*  All the stuff they got in that trade that's still going and going and going. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=968.16s)]
*  Um, I wouldn't be upset if they won. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=972.08s)]
*  I, you know, there's a whole case of can Brooklyn even survive unless they had [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=975.12s)]
*  a guy like this in New York city? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=981.0s)]
*  Like when you think about what happened with the Knicks this year, I just think [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=982.28s)]
*  Brooklyn's going to be the ugly stepchild in New York basketball forever, unless [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=984.76s)]
*  they get a guy like this, so that's the case for it and a Phoenix pizza outside [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=988.88s)]
*  Barclays I got, I'm going to throw that in there too for Karma, great pizza. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  I think for all the same reasons that we, I don't know, Utah still has more [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=998.36s)]
*  challenges than Brooklyn would, um, but right. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1002.8s)]
*  Cause we see nothing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1008.64s)]
*  We're gonna lure guys already. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1009.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1010.96s)]
*  There's nothing on this Brooklyn roster that even gets you excited to the point [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1011.44s)]
*  of like even Lowry marketing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1016.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1018.36s)]
*  Charlotte's next 14% number on ads played the game like everybody else did. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1019.5600000000001s)]
*  Uh, new ownership. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1026.68s)]
*  I like Charles Lee. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  I wonder if you get flagged, how many guys are still on this team? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1031.16s)]
*  Two years from now, if you get flagged over under two and a half, would you go [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1035.28s)]
*  over under two years from now? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1040.88s)]
*  Uh, you'd say two and a half over two and a half who's on the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1045.52s)]
*  two thousand 28, 29 season roster. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1050.52s)]
*  Well, it's already two with Lamelo and. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1053.76s)]
*  So Lamelo was sure. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1055.6s)]
*  Kind of are we well Miller who I don't know Miller. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1069.48s)]
*  I just look like he's going to be really good. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1071.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1073.12s)]

*  I don't trust. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1075.48s)]
*  I wouldn't say that's already been traded. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1076.12s)]
*  Miles bridges is different conversation. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1077.9599999999998s)]
*  Grant Williams leadership council. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1079.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1082.32s)]
*  Your guy has saloon. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1083.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1084.36s)]
*  Do you have a saloon salon? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1085.0s)]
*  Salon, whatever his name is. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1087.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1089.08s)]
*  Gosh, that's how bad this year went. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1089.6399999999999s)]
*  Not a strong rookie year. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1091.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1093.0s)]
*  It's a long, some tough basketball reference. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1093.24s)]
*  I told you I liked watching them. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  I didn't know if it was going to be any good or not. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  I didn't sell the stock yet, but I, you know, I do have a red flag next to it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1101.48s)]
*  Chicago number on odds, 1.8%. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1106.76s)]
*  But, uh, I like some of the trades that they recently made. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1109.12s)]
*  Uh, we were just, we're in a weird territory here because we've got [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1112.72s)]
*  Toronto number on odds, 7.5%. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1115.8799999999999s)]
*  You and I have hated them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  Wait, wait, make the case for Chicago. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1119.1599999999999s)]
*  Isn't there something to be said of like, no, they they're, it's pathetic [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1122.1999999999998s)]
*  that they don't spend money. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1127.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1129.12s)]
*  I don't think I think they've spent the tax once in 15 years, but I just [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1129.3999999999999s)]

*  That's really the only place. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1149.96s)]
*  Posters possibly Toronto 7.5%. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1152.36s)]
*  You and I have not liked their moves. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1157.24s)]
*  Uh, I, uh, the only reason they're this high is cause there's [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1161.32s)]
*  four other teams that have to be lower than them. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1167.36s)]
*  And I don't really make, I can't come up with a case for Toronto. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1170.6799999999998s)]
*  I have nothing to add. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1177.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1178.56s)]
*  Now we're in the bottom floor, New Orleans, their number one odds are 12.5%. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1180.04s)]
*  They've drafted really well, which we've talked about many, many times. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1188.28s)]
*  They've made some really bad trades. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1192.72s)]
*  They seem like they're jinxed as a franchise and as a basketball city. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1194.36s)]
*  This would be the one city I'd be actually worried for Cooper flag. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1198.28s)]
*  If he went there because it just seems like nothing good happens there. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1201.1999999999998s)]
*  Um, but the fun piece is from a karma basketball. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1204.32s)]
*  If they did get flag, it opens up content left and right for us. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1207.7199999999998s)]
*  There's so many possible trades. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1211.52s)]
*  They might be good right away. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1213.4399999999998s)]
*  It could be like, he could swing them by 20 wins potentially just cause they [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1215.1999999999998s)]
*  already had a lot of talent in place. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1218.9599999999998s)]
*  So that part's fine. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1221.36s)]
*  But man, it just feels like they've had a lot of luck already with like, they [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1222.32s)]
*  won the Zion lottery, you know, like it's hard to say, oh man, they're due. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1225.6s)]
*  Like they literally won one of the three hardest lotteries that we've had for [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1231.3999999999999s)]
*  what people wanted in the last 15 years. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1236.52s)]
*  So that's the case for New Orleans for and against. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1238.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1243.1599999999999s)]
*  I probably would like them to get it a little bit more. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1243.48s)]
*  I don't know if it hits a reset on the franchise. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1245.8s)]
*  My guess is that they're going to be able to get it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1248.76s)]
*  I would like them to get it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1250.68s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a pretty good deal, but I don't think it's a good deal for [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  the franchise. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1256.64s)]
*  My guess is most owners wouldn't win the lottery and then be like, okay, cool. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1258.2s)]
*  Now let's be bad around just winning the lottery. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1262.8000000000002s)]
*  And maybe I don't know what to believe on whether or not there's a, everybody's [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  all on the same page about keeping Zion. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1270.48s)]
*  I just don't have any more years. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1273.0s)]
*  You can keep going into a season, like hoping this thing is going to work out. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1274.0800000000002s)]
*  And even if you traded them, it ended up being a star somewhere else. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1276.8000000000002s)]
*  If that's bleeding into your decision-making, then I don't think you are [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  making the right decision with this. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  But we all realize how special Zion can be when it's out. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1285.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't even care if I traded him and he was awesome somewhere else. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1288.5600000000002s)]
*  I could not go back into another season. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1290.76s)]
*  Having every one of our hopes tied to somebody where it feels like it just [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1293.3200000000002s)]
*  ends bad all the time. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1297.0400000000002s)]
*  And if you win the lottery with Cooper and Trey Murphy, I would start, you [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1298.16s)]
*  know, again, nobody, nobody likes when the media is just sitting there telling [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1302.3600000000001s)]
*  everyone to blow it up all over again. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  But they might be the perfect candidate for it because they have drafted. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1307.2s)]
*  Well, there's other players. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1311.24s)]
*  Like we didn't even mention Herb Jones anymore because he's been hurt. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1312.72s)]
*  I would just try to figure out what I could do. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1315.52s)]
*  Murray's out for most of the year. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1317.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1320.0800000000002s)]
*  And you know, CJ is a nice player. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1320.52s)]
*  There's probably still some value there. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1322.16s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're going to have like seven guys, uh, aspiring this off [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1323.28s)]
*  season yet this next year is, is he's an expiring heading into the next season. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1328.88s)]
*  Got it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1334.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1334.28s)]
*  Got it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1334.48s)]
*  Um, I looked up the Zion contract stuff to familiarize myself with it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1334.8s)]
*  And I thought there was like partial guarantees. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1339.24s)]
*  They could let him go before July 15th and just get completely out of it, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  which I, I wouldn't do that. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1345.28s)]
*  I had forgotten that that was an option. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1346.8400000000001s)]
*  No, cause Shams brought it up. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1349.16s)]
*  Remember when he wasn't playing doing, by the way, they could just go ahead. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1350.5600000000002s)]
*  To me, that's insane. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1354.0s)]
*  There's still, there's always another team that's thinking if we get him with us. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1355.04s)]
*  The ceiling version of Zion with us, that guy is not for [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1361.24s)]
*  free. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1364.44s)]
*  I know what you're saying, but I've heard the argument before. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1365.52s)]
*  There's no way you would just go out. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1367.3200000000002s)]
*  Let's just, I'm not saying I would do it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1368.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying it's in play. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1370.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a thing that they can do. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1373.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1375.3200000000002s)]
*  You're saying it's in play, but it's, you know, what else is in play? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1375.68s)]
*  What's that? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1378.88s)]
*  They could trade for somebody who takes the Zion contract and immediately [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1379.3200000000002s)]
*  intends to waive the contract because this will be their way to get out of [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1383.88s)]
*  a shitload of money. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1388.48s)]
*  I just don't think that he is at that point where you would want nothing or [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1389.28s)]
*  acquire him to get off of money to then waive him. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1395.24s)]
*  You know why you're right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1398.28s)]
*  Because you could do this all again next year. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1399.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1402.8799999999999s)]
*  You could take, even if you're trading for him, you could take a flyer and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1403.08s)]
*  I'm knowing that, all right, if this goes badly again next year, I could just [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1405.6s)]
*  get out of it and waive them again. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1408.92s)]
*  But I just, everyone is so desperate to shed money. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1411.16s)]
*  I just think it's notable that somebody who makes $39 million a year, who [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1414.44s)]
*  could match with anyone in a trade, you could then wave and get out of all the [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1417.88s)]
*  money, all the apron shit that comes with it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1420.68s)]
*  I don't, I don't think that's nothing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1423.0s)]
*  It's my worst fear for the Celtics. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1426.52s)]
*  What? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1430.16s)]
*  That they were traded for Zion and then waive them? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1430.24s)]
*  Like the new owners like now that I have the team, guess what? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1432.88s)]
*  We're cutting costs. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1437.3200000000002s)]
*  We've traded for Zion and we're waving them. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1439.64s)]
*  Sounds like somebody was having some down O2 thoughts. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1442.1200000000001s)]
*  That I think this is my fault. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1444.72s)]
*  That I think this is my fourth Margarita. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1446.24s)]
*  The next started to come back. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1449.04s)]
*  I was like, Oh my God. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1450.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1451.64s)]
*  Bottom three San Antonio, third from last number one, odd 6.8. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1452.24s)]
*  They won with Wemby. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1456.6s)]
*  That's really the only reason I have nothing else with the Admiral Duncan [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1457.44s)]
*  women, Yama and then get Cooper flag. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1462.12s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1464.52s)]
*  Cause I know everybody was listening like, Hey, the Spurs, they do it the right way. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1465.44s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1468.72s)]
*  They've had too much luck. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1469.2s)]
*  No, we're good. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1470.2s)]
*  You get Duncan, Wemby, stop. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1470.88s)]
*  No one's going to agree with us. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1472.76s)]
*  We're right. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1474.2s)]
*  We're right. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1475.36s)]
*  Which leads us to the second and last karma team, the Philadelphia 76ers. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1476.0s)]
*  Their number one odds are 10.5% top four, 42%. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1481.0s)]
*  If it falls seven or lower, they're in the five spot now. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1484.4s)]
*  If two teams jump them. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1487.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1488.48s)]
*  See, he gets their pick. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1488.72s)]
*  I just don't think you should be able to stumble into Cooper flag after the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1490.48s)]
*  summer they had last year. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1493.6s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1494.8s)]
*  It's outright ridiculous. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1497.12s)]
*  I'd be happy for Max. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1498.52s)]
*  They had be happy for McCain, but, um, the Embiid extension combined with the [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1499.48s)]
*  Paul George four years and, um, and trotting out the big three media dialogue [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1504.24s)]
*  and the title stuff and all of it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1509.84s)]
*  If it leads to Cooper flag, that's outrageous. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1512.6s)]
*  No offense to our Philly fan friends. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1515.88s)]
*  It would be outrageous. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1518.44s)]
*  It really would be. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1524.4s)]
*  I almost want it to happen. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1526.68s)]
*  People are going to be so pissed off. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1528.2s)]
*  Like, people are going to be so mad. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1530.56s)]
*  Cause it was so, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1532.16s)]
*  so mad. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1533.12s)]
*  Cause it was, this is how it played out. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1533.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1535.6s)]
*  And what it wasn't just that this was on the table. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1535.96s)]
*  It's when everything was falling apart and then you were looking at their record. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1538.96s)]
*  And then the Sixers are going to those games being like, you think you're [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1543.16s)]
*  fucking tanking, we're fucking tanking. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1545.48s)]
*  We introduce you to Bona. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1547.76s)]
*  Oh, Hey Nets, you want to play hard in the fourth quarter? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1550.76s)]
*  We're running ISOs for Edwards. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1554.04s)]
*  Like fuck you guys. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1555.84s)]
*  They're ready to like Tanya Harding, uh, Quinton Grimes. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1556.96s)]
*  They were just going to hire some fat guy to hit him on the side of the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1560.28s)]
*  side of the leg on the bench. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1563.48s)]
*  Well, Toronto kept winning these games because their defense was somehow [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  incredible this late into the season. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1567.32s)]
*  And, uh, or they had that stretch. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1568.8s)]
*  I would, I would say that you're like, how the hell's Toronto keep [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1571.0s)]
*  winning some of these games. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1573.8799999999999s)]
*  But Philly and I see, I think Philly. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1574.84s)]
*  Like in a way I, I like what they did where they're like, we're not screwing [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1577.84s)]
*  around, even though Quinton Grimes is for that, that stretch, it's like, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1586.04s)]
*  are they going to cost them this top six protection on this thing? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1589.92s)]
*  So we were chasing the top six protection. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1592.68s)]
*  We're falling all of that stuff. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1594.72s)]
*  Like, are they going to actually lose this pick? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1595.72s)]
*  Like the worst case scenario of what could happen here, considering how bad [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1597.3200000000002s)]
*  the season is like on top of everything else and guess who else has the pick. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1601.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh great. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1603.88s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1604.44s)]
*  See what a shocker to them getting Cooper flag. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1605.0s)]
*  I think that'd be a lot for, for people to handle. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1607.64s)]
*  I think people would rather the spurs with it than the 76ers. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1610.72s)]
*  Embiid think of the headline Embiid excited to take Cooper [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1614.8000000000002s)]
*  flag under his wing, a new long ESPN feature. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1619.68s)]
*  Um, last but not least now it's weird because they should be last [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1624.8s)]
*  in the lottery karma rankings, but they, you could also make a case. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1630.8s)]
*  They should be first because of the fans, the Dallas Mavericks, number one [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1634.6000000000001s)]
*  odds, 1.8%, top four, 8.5%. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1639.52s)]
*  Um, to do that Luca trade and then end up with Cooper flag would be a [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1642.68s)]
*  moral outrage, not even an outrage. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1649.36s)]
*  I'd be morally outraged. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1652.04s)]
*  My morals would be discombobulated by it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1653.3999999999999s)]
*  I just can't believe that's how it would work out. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1655.6s)]
*  It would make me so mad. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1657.52s)]
*  Like really? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1659.12s)]
*  You motherfuckers just got Cooper flag after making the dumbest [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1660.84s)]
*  trade anyone else has ever seen. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1663.8799999999999s)]
*  And it worked out and you got Cooper flag out of it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1667.1999999999998s)]
*  But on the other hand, for the Mavericks fans who are as traumatized and upset [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1670.6s)]
*  about a trade as any fan base I've ever seen since I've started to like sports, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1677.84s)]
*  I'd be happy for them, but I think they have to be last. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1682.6s)]
*  I feel like the fan part should prevent them from being last. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1689.08s)]
*  Like why are the sixers? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1693.12s)]
*  What about San Antonio? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1695.9199999999998s)]
*  Because at least they'd be rewarded for. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1700.28s)]
*  They've done some good stuff. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1703.84s)]
*  San Antonio, the Fox trade was good. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1704.8799999999999s)]
*  Castle pick was good. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1707.28s)]
*  They, they tanked while also seeming like they cared about the season, which I think [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1710.9199999999998s)]
*  is a hard line to straddle. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1715.72s)]
*  Yeah, but see, I, I'm, that's almost why I appreciate Darrell and the sixers were [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1719.12s)]
*  going, you guys want to act like there's these rules of engagement shit. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1723.76s)]
*  You guys want to have one of those operations where it's like, yeah, we're sort [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1727.44s)]
*  of invading this area, but we're kind of not because we gave it a title. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1731.0s)]
*  Like you ever want to go through and just laugh your ass off. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1735.8s)]
*  Look at some of the military operations titles, just the branding of them to try [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1738.08s)]
*  to make everybody feel a little bit like nothing's even called a war anymore. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1742.68s)]
*  And when I think about what the sixers did, you can call this whatever you want, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1746.48s)]
*  label whatever you want. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1753.72s)]
*  There are no rules. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1755.24s)]
*  Like we're doing this. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1756.68s)]
*  And it was crazy. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1758.68s)]
*  Basketball, nobody remember in a year. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1759.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1761.3999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, look, whether it's that Dallas argument years ago, where it felt [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1761.8s)]
*  like it was terrible or the Doug Peterson, Philadelphia Eagles thing, where [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1766.44s)]
*  it made sense for the Eagles to lose that game, but because it's the national [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1771.24s)]
*  broadcast and we're seeing it happen in real time and everybody's got their phones [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1774.24s)]
*  out and there's no other games on distract us from it, then it becomes this [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1777.4s)]
*  like act against humanity. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1780.4s)]
*  And I, I don't like the, like, I know what you're saying where the Spurs did it [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1782.3200000000002s)]
*  in the decent way, right? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1786.64s)]
*  Utah wasn't perhaps as decent. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1788.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1790.16s)]
*  Take, you know, again, we're keep using that word that everybody loves about [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1790.76s)]
*  ethical tanking or ethical hoops. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1793.8s)]
*  Uh, I don't know. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1795.96s)]
*  That just feels, that feels nasty to have Dallas last, but I know you're [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1798.3200000000002s)]
*  thinking about Nico and maybe there was some after Luca and the Lakers lost in [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1802.72s)]
*  five games, the people in the media that suggested somehow we needed to revisit [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1806.3600000000001s)]
*  the Nico Harrison conversation. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1811.3200000000002s)]
*  Like this is like watching a four by 100 relay and seeing the first handoff [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1813.44s)]
*  and going, well, that's over. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1817.3600000000001s)]
*  This is not when you're evaluating this. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1819.1999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, again, it has nothing to do with what the Lakers or Luca didn't [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1820.9599999999998s)]
*  do in the playoffs this year has everything to do with the execution of [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1825.08s)]
*  this historically bad trait. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1828.1999999999998s)]
*  So even if it turns out in five years, like Lucas heard of like, Hey, was [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1830.28s)]
*  Nico right? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1833.24s)]
*  The process will forever be wrong. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1834.32s)]
*  And when that gets eliminated, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1837.36s)]
*  when Reeves gets traded this summer and he will get traded, um, and the stuff [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1838.84s)]
*  that they get back for him is going to make it seem even worse that they didn't [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1844.9199999999998s)]
*  get him in the trade. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1847.84s)]
*  I know, I know it's a TV show and this is somebody who's done this for a long [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1852.1599999999999s)]
*  time. You know, what's happening in those pre-show meetings. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1855.28s)]
*  Like, Hey, do we need to revisit the Nico conversation? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1857.32s)]
*  It's like, I don't know. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1859.52s)]
*  What's the rest of the rundown look like? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1860.36s)]
*  Like, Oh, we're kind of like, you know, there's no football stuff. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1862.12s)]
*  It's like, all right, you know, maybe we'll throw it in the D's. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1864.52s)]
*  I can do two more minutes on Nico. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1866.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1868.3999999999999s)]
*  Just set me up and yeah. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  And then sometimes that itself is the segment, ask the question and then you [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1870.6399999999999s)]
*  just shoot down the entire idea. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1874.12s)]
*  But anyone that really is paying attention again, and I shouldn't even phrase [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1875.4s)]
*  it that way, same people would go, this is not a conversation that we can have [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1879.4s)]
*  right now because of an elimination in one year of the playoffs. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  So go ahead. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1887.5600000000002s)]
*  We have to go. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1888.2800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1889.3200000000002s)]
*  So I always grab a dream team cup when I do the pod. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1889.96s)]
*  I love that you do that. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1893.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't notice that I grabbed John Stockton. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1894.76s)]
*  I just grabbed one. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1897.4s)]
*  Does it mean anything that I grabbed John Stockton for the lottery? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1899.64s)]
*  Um, 12, I had 12 choices of dream team cups, I guess, Malone or Stockton. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1902.84s)]
*  So it was a one in six chance. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1908.56s)]
*  I was grabbing a Utah thing, which is basically the exact same odds that [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1909.8s)]
*  they have in the lottery. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1913.0s)]
*  So I grabbed a John Stockton. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1914.76s)]
*  Don't think about it. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1915.96s)]
*  We'll see tomorrow night. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1918.36s)]
*  If it's a coincidence. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1919.1599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQV9KIxiVjo&t=1920.08s)]
