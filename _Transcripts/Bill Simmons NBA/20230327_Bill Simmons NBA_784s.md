# What Is Wrong With the Mavericks Right Now? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P6D-AgKTqw)
*  Dallas Mavericks in complete crisis mode.
*  Rossella, they just lost two out of three in three days to, uh, to Charlotte Hornets,
*  who were in the Wemba Niyama sweepstakes who did not have Lamilla ball anymore.
*  And have been in the running for most inconsequential league pass team this year.
*  I don't know where they rank for you, but I've probably logged my usage rate with
*  the Hornets is probably about as low as any team.
*  It was really embarrassing for the Mavs.
*  They traded their 2029 for Kyrie.
*  I think they were thinking maybe offensively, they could just overpower teams.
*  They can't rebound.
*  I think they got out rebounded by like 18 today.
*  They don't get stops.
*  And this is a team that even if they sneak it into play and nothing's going to happen,
*  they made the Western finals last year.
*  This has surpassed Zion.
*  You did the biggest disappointments thing in your pot on Tuesday.
*  I think Dallas not making the, even the plan would be the biggest disappointment
*  of the season.
*  What are you seeing?
*  What's wrong with them?
*  Well, it's funny because you're, you're right.
*  When there's, when there's a tie on the TV for another game, Charlotte's rarely
*  winning it at this point, but for us to be on the West coast and you and I are
*  texting this morning and I'm thinking like Dallas loses to Charlotte the other
*  night, they were 16 and a half point favorites.
*  That's the largest spread a team has lost all NBA season.
*  So it's 10 AM and I'm like, I got to make sure I'm in front of the TV for Dallas
*  Charlotte, cause I have to see what's going to happen.
*  And it gets off to a horrible start.
*  Uh, the oddity of it in the first half, I don't think any of the other
*  starters besides Kyrie and Lucas scored any points.
*  And so then kid changed it up to start in the second half.
*  And I actually think Dallas was trying.
*  I mean, there's defensive stuff that you can see, but I didn't see a team.
*  Like the first game you go, okay, whatever weird stuff happens.
*  Caught him off guard, but then to lose to him again immediately.
*  And it didn't seem fluke.
*  Like they couldn't guard.
*  Um, and you know, when Dallas gets bogged down offensively, like, you
*  know what it's going to be, it's going to be a lot of predictable stuff, but
*  Lucas so good and Kyrie so good and ISO that it's still going to work a lot.
*  So, um,
*  Luke had a 40, 12 and eight.
*  Yeah.
*  And they got off to a bad start.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he missed his first six shots too on top of everything else.
*  So look, I don't even think we're at the point, despite all the Kyrie stuff,
*  which is pretty, you know, when everybody's like, Hey, why don't you do
*  this, but you don't do it with this guy.
*  But you're like, Hey, when, when somebody else catches up to the Kyrie
*  bingo, then we will probably criticize that guy as much as we criticize Kyrie.
*  Is that okay?
*  But to this point, I don't know that this is solely about Kyrie.
*  The problem is, is that Vinny Smith was very valuable as a wing defender.
*  And now you find Bullock or Hardaway junior in some of those roles.
*  And they can't rebound.
*  They got out, rebounded by 21 today.
*  Luca was their leading rebounder with 12.
*  Kyrie wasn't like upgrading from the Dinwiddie, whatever point guard
*  situation they had to Kyrie was not really what they needed.
*  What they really needed was a rebounder defender, somebody who could clean up
*  stuff, they just don't have it.
*  The Christian would you go back to the Christian wood trade in June where they
*  gave up the 26 pick in the draft and some contracts took a fire on him.
*  Uh, they trade Dinwiddie and DFS and their 29 first for, uh, for Kyrie, who's
*  a free agent who could bolt and then that looks bad on the flip side, they have a
*  top 10 protected pick to the Knicks, but they have one of the top 10 worst records
*  right now, so they might actually keep that pick that would handicap them going
*  forward.
*  They have their, their picks for 24, 25, 26, 27, but if somehow they keep their
*  pick this year, I was on the phone with somebody today talking about them and we
*  were having a debate of, do you just shut it down if you're the maps and just try
*  to get like the eighth pick in the draft and just throw the season away and you
*  really can't because of the Kyrie piece of it, cause you might not come back.
*  I don't know from what you've seen, do you like the combo of Luca and Kyrie,
*  especially Kyrie at this point in his career?
*  So that'd be the first thing I would try to figure out.
*  Are these the two guys you want to build around?
*  You want to build around Luca, but does this combo make sense, especially with
*  the point of, uh, the career that Kyrie is at right now where he misses 20 to
*  30 games a year?
*  Well, there's two things personally, if I were GM and Kyrie are on the team and
*  the owner said, Hey, we, we have to resign them to four year max.
*  I would say you just fire me then.
*  Right.
*  I'm not doing that.
*  Um, what about a three year deal with a team option?
*  I would still say like, please fire me.
*  Right.
*  Uh, let me give me time to find another job, but this is different because
*  it's Nico Harrison who's from Nike had the relationship with Kyrie.
*  I believe that that's probably some of the motivation behind this where it's
*  like, you know, maybe we can kind of figure them out, but I don't even know
*  that it's really on him now.
*  I don't.
*  I mean, part of the other reason they were losing games and in this bad
*  stretch is, you know, Luca missed five games.
*  Um, if you look at some of the overall stuff, the offense has been pretty
*  similar, a tick better, worse ranking wise, defensively, you know, that was
*  really weird cause they turned this around last year because they figured
*  out their defense.
*  Now we know the personnel isn't the same, but they're a bottom third defense.
*  And since this last stretch, they're kind of like in that 25th range.
*  So, well, Kyrie's not helping on that front.
*  I kind of default to the rule of.
*  You can't watch, like if say they missed the playoffs, right.
*  After you gave up the resources and protecting the asset, I mean, the default
*  is usually the team would resign Kyrie knowing that it's like, well, even if we
*  don't like the way it works, um, that we're just going to punt on this whole
*  thing, then how do we replace anything that's even close to that talent?
*  How do we replace that kind of asset just against the cap?
*  So, I mean, what would you do?
*  Sign and trade him.
*  I don't know to where, but I still feel like he has value because he's so
*  respected just for how talented he is with the actual players.
*  So many guys in the league love him that I feel like they could turn him into
*  something.
*  This is really bad though for Dallas.
*  Since January 1st, they're 15 and 23, which is the eighth worst record in the
*  league.
*  Everybody else who's in there, except for New Orleans is a team that is headed for
*  the, uh, the tanking sweepstakes.
*  Last year, if you remember, they started out slow and then went on this
*  ripper on run and the league was a little different.
*  Um, I don't think the offense wasn't good, was as good day to day.
*  And just in general, if they had a better, deeper, more complete team, this
*  year, it's like every move they made didn't work.
*  Like they signed JaVale with their mid level.
*  Can't play him.
*  He can't trade him either.
*  You're just stuck with them.
*  The Christian would thing for whatever reason, he never clicked with kid.
*  Well, he's never clicked anywhere.
*  You know, that's what we said when they made the trade.
*  It's like, this is, this is a flyer.
*  Don't think of this as anything more than a fire because he's not reliable and
*  he's only been on bad teams.
*  What is he?
*  We didn't know.
*  Well, here's what he is year by year, Philadelphia, one year, Charlotte, one
*  year, Milwaukee, one year, New Orleans, one year, Detroit, one year, Houston,
*  one plus year, like then they moved on from him and now, um, actually no,
*  Houston, it was two years.
*  Uh, why, why do we pretend this is a mystery?
*  You know, he's an incredibly talented player, but he's very focused on kind
*  of what he's doing and the other parts of the game and look, some of those
*  other stops is not entirely fair.
*  It wasn't like he was playing the entire season, but it seems like anybody
*  that's had him in, in their building has been like, Oh, okay.
*  Like we're over it.
*  So I think it also gets back to like the Luca thing, because now Luca's in that,
*  that range of, okay, you're drafted.
*  Holy shit.
*  Okay.
*  This guy's going to be an MVP.
*  This is he was bit, what has he been MVP favorite two times coming in, even in
*  those Clippers series losses, Bill, you're like, this is insane.
*  What this dude is capable of.
*  Nobody is denying how incredibly talented he is.
*  And the fact that like, there's not much you can do with him with his
*  dribble drive angle, understanding and some of the passing, but he's such a high
*  usage guy, I don't know if it's that he only wants to play that way, or if you
*  can only build the team that way.
*  So then he plays the way the team is built.
*  Like I have a hard time knowing exactly what the best way, like picking everybody
*  around the league saying this would be the best center for him.
*  This is the best opposite guard.
*  These are the best forwards.
*  Like, yeah, I could figure it out, but it's not realistic.
*  You could ever do that as GM and say, Hey, I get my four magical
*  guys to play next to Luca.
*  I think he's a little harder fit and knowing exactly how you're going
*  to put somebody else around him.
*  Agree.
*  And I do think we should talk about much like we did with Harden, these guys that
*  are so distinct that you have to put around this specific team around them.
*  Should they take the merits for that?
*  Cause I always felt like with Harden, he had the ball so much, he could only
*  play with these certain types of players.
*  That's what was cool about watching him with Philly where he unleashed this,
*  you know, other part of his game.
*  I think about that a lot when I watched Luca, because I don't really like
*  watching the Mavericks and having all season and part of it is cause I just
*  don't like watching that kind of basketball.
*  I didn't like watching with Harden.
*  I don't like watching here.
*  I don't like watching Atlanta when Trae Young has the ball at the time.
*  I just don't enjoy it.
*  I like when I like inclusive basketball.
*  I like when, you know, like somebody like Yocage who has a 27 usage rate, but
*  still feels like everything runs through him.
*  Um, I don't like watching the Mavericks.
*  And if I'm thinking what kind of team do I want to build around this guy?
*  He's this amazing one man show.
*  They got to the final four last year.
*  So that's good.
*  Right.
*  And at the same time, if you're, if you're making excuses for him, I was looking,
*  sometimes this doesn't matter at all.
*  When you look at the stats, when a team wins and a team loses, you ever look at
*  us, sometimes when a team loses, the guy's stats are a little better, you know, and,
*  or sometimes they'll be the same or that most of the time, nine out of 10 times,
*  there's no lesson to be had.
*  It's really interesting in his case though, when Dallas wins this season, he's
*  averaging 36, nine and nine, 51, 41, 77% shooting, and they have a 130 offensive
*  rating when he's on the court.
*  That's when they win.
*  When they lose, he's 38, Nate, 46%, 27% from three, and they have a 110 offensive
*  rating.
*  So on the one hand, everything falls on him.
*  And if he has a bad game, they're going to lose.
*  And if he has a good game, they have a really good chance of winning.
*  On the other hand, they've kind of built the team that way.
*  And now you could say, well, that's why they got Kyrie.
*  They wanted to diversify and all that stuff.
*  But now you have two of your five guys can't guard anybody.
*  We thought when this trade happened, I don't think either of us really liked it,
*  but I also understood it because it was a panic move and the panic was, well, at
*  least if this doesn't work out, Kyrie leaves as a free agent.
*  We sacrifice that pick, but at least we have cap space.
*  I don't know.
*  I went through all the free agents today.
*  Who's the guy you're getting?
*  You're getting Fred Van Vliet for 40 million a year.
*  Getting Vusovic.
*  Like who's out there that solves their problems?
*  I don't see anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  And the weird thing is Dallas is history of not getting free agents, which doesn't
*  make any sense.
*  It's probably on the higher end of the destination cities in the NBA.
*  I mean, no state tax.
*  Yep.
*  Can't ever mention that without mentioning that part of it.
*  So remember how like Cuban would talk about all the different ways very early as
*  an owner, like he wanted the, I think we've covered this before, so I'm not going
*  to spend a ton of time on it, but he wanted the visitors locker room actually to
*  be awesome because he wanted potential, you know, free agents to go, wow, they,
*  this is a first-class operation all the way through.
*  So we did the ringer.
*  I know you gave me a hat when I showed up.
*  Give you a hat.
*  I was like, we are first class.
*  Here's your hat.
*  Yeah.
*  It says R that, you know, that's, that means something.
*  Uh, but I, you know, I don't know.
*  I don't know if it's like, I, sometimes I think things happen.
*  It doesn't mean anything.
*  Boston forever.
*  Couldn't get a free agent.
*  And then all of a sudden they get Al Horford and Gordon Hayward like immediately.
*  Right.
*  And so it was like, wow, they, you know, maybe, maybe it's a cyclical thing.
*  So they're in a really tough spot.
*  They're in a really tough spot, but you know, despite the Kyrie stuff that is
*  totally fair to factor in all this, it hasn't been great.
*  Uh, I think they're what three and eight now with the two of them in games.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, he's already had a couple moments where you just go, you're
*  going to do this again, man, you're going to start calling.
*  He had a guy thrown out of the stands today, which again, I have no idea what
*  that guy said, so I'm not going to take sides here, but you know, with Kyrie,
*  there's always a little bit extra.
*  So I don't know if that's what like, Luke would mention that he had these
*  personal issues going on and he's not having that much fun and all this kind
*  of stuff and it just, look, it just feels really bad right now and maybe they get
*  into the playing game, but I, I don't like.
*  Yeah.
*  To what end?
*  What, what are you doing in this?
*  I mean, in a playing game, they could beat anybody just cause Luke could be
*  incredible and he could have 50.
