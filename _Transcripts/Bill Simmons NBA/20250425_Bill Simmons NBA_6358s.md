# Shedeur’s Slide, NFL Draft Takes and a Nuggets Code Red | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=0.0s)]
*  So we just watched the NFL draft and three basketball playoff games all at [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=26.48s)]
*  the same time. And it was really great. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=30.44s)]
*  And I wrote down a bunch of notes for the NFL draft because anyone I wanted to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=31.96s)]
*  have with me in this first segment is all doing another pod for the ringer. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=36.04s)]
*  So you know what? I'm going to solo, I'm a pro. I can do it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=39.96s)]
*  But I did have some thoughts. First of all, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  the Jaguars trading the second pick to pick Travis Hunter, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=46.24s)]
*  which was somehow another devastating Patriots moment. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  I had already mourned the fact that we screwed up week 18. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=54.56s)]
*  We screwed up our chance to have a top pick and to trade down and get all this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=57.36s)]
*  stuff. And then the Browns had the second pick. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  They get number five, a second, a fourth, at a 2026 for Hunter. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  And I just, I almost started drinking, but I knew I had a podcast. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  It's always disorienting when the Browns do something smart. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  That was one of my first takeaways from this. Cause he just, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=77.36s)]
*  usually the Browns lose a trade like this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  I thought this was insane by the Jaguars. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=82.28s)]
*  I know everyone thinks Travis Hunter is a one-on-one, all that stuff, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=84.52s)]
*  but I just don't think you trade huge packages like this unless you're getting a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=87.48s)]
*  quarterback. I think the Browns were thinking the same thing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=91.52s)]
*  Any of us would think of her in this situation. When in doubt, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=95.72s)]
*  trade with the con family. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=99.2s)]
*  I think they'd become like Vivek and the Kings in the NBA. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=100.56s)]
*  I think the con and the Jaguars, I think that whole family is the same way. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=103.92s)]
*  It's like, cool, they're going to overpay for second pick. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=107.48s)]
*  We can move down three spots, take Mason Graham, get a first round pick, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=110.4s)]
*  get a second, get a fourth. Sure. Let's do that. One of the cool things though, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=114.4s)]
*  ESPN covered this in the moment. Like Kim Ward was getting picked. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=118.96s)]
*  I think he was even going up to the podium and Schefter came right in and was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=123.0s)]
*  like, we had a trade, blah, blah, blah. I think with the NBA, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=126.6s)]
*  they always like kind of wait. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=130.64s)]
*  You find out the trade happened on Twitter before anything happens. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=133.0s)]
*  And then I liked how it felt like it was part of the action. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  They announced the trade when they did the pick. This isn't hard NBA. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=139.24s)]
*  Just get this together. Um, I guess the, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=142.88s)]
*  the positive for Jacksonville if there is a positive for overpaying for Travis [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  Hunter, when, uh, we've never seen anybody, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=151.08s)]
*  but it'll post play both sides of the ball anymore. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=153.24s)]
*  And I can't wait to watch cause this can be super fun. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=155.4s)]
*  They're probably like a top seven or top eight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=158.36s)]
*  I'm at least intrigued to see what's going on on the multi view with them for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=160.96s)]
*  the first four weeks of the season with Hunter and with, uh, Brian Thomas Jr. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=164.36s)]
*  Who I loved watching last year, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=168.4s)]
*  but the big thing I was thinking when there's those London games, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=170.92s)]
*  which they always suck when the Jaguars are involved. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=173.24s)]
*  And now it's like Travis Hunter's in the London games for the next couple of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=175.6s)]
*  years. That's a bonus. That's, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=178.64s)]
*  that's worth getting up at six 30 in the morning in the Pacific coast. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=181.76s)]
*  You're like, all right, get to watch Travis Hunter. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=185.92s)]
*  Maybe he'll play D back end receiver the whole game. Um, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=187.84s)]
*  the big thing for me though, once again, they've overpaid, um, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=192.68s)]
*  to get travel Trevor Lawrence and toys. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  So they've spent money on Christian Kirk, Calvin Ridley, Evan Ingram, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  Big money on Christian Kirk. That was a much maligned signing back in the day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  They drafted Michael Thomas with the first round pick. That was smart. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=208.04s)]
*  They drafted Travis at TN, uh, 25th in the first round. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=211.64s)]
*  I think the same year they picked Lawrence. Um, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  and then they paid Lawrence huge money. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  It just seems like they're constantly trying to throw assets at him, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=221.04s)]
*  hoping he's good. And the thing is he might not be good. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=225.24s)]
*  So we'll see, but at least, uh, at least the London games will be fun. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=229.56s)]
*  But I thought that was a good trade for the Browns. Uh, next thing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=233.84s)]
*  So should our Sanders, it, you know, this just kept going, um, for weeks and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=237.28s)]
*  weeks. I'm, I'm not, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not throwing darts cause I certainly talked about it on my podcast a couple [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=243.84s)]
*  of times. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=247.72s)]
*  It was weird to think that he wasn't going to go in the first round in a league [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=248.72s)]
*  where it feels like a third of the teams always need a quarterback when teams [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=254.24s)]
*  who were drafting in this first round needed a quarterback. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=258.76s)]
*  The giants passed on him twice. They haven't had a quarterback since Eli retired. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=262.12s)]
*  Um, Mel Kiper just felt he just had, I'm going down with the ship energy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=266.72s)]
*  Most of the mock draft guys just didn't think Sanders should be a top 20 pick, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=271.68s)]
*  including, um, Todd McShay, the ringer draft guys that we have. And, uh, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=276.3s)]
*  and Kiper was just, I, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=280.92s)]
*  I guess like if Sanders turns out to be an awesome pro, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=284.68s)]
*  this would be great for Kiper. But you know, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=287.24s)]
*  I was going nuts the year Lamar fell because the Pats had a chance to get him. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=289.6s)]
*  And, um, you know, and, and it just, with, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=293.44000000000005s)]
*  with Brady's advancing age, it just seemed like a no brainer. But in that case, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=297.12s)]
*  it seemed really crazy that Lamar was falling with how talented he was in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  college and how he was clearly something. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=306.22s)]
*  Everybody has picked apart Sanders to the point that I don't even know what to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  think anymore. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=312.4s)]
*  So maybe he ends up in Cleveland tomorrow by the time you hear this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  And if that happens in Cleveland, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=317.4s)]
*  we thought maybe we could take them a two and they get them at 33. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  They desperately need a quarterback. That's a really fun outcome. He got, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=324.44s)]
*  this is great for, I was thinking, this is great for us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=328.55999999999995s)]
*  This is just great content, right? I root for content sometimes. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=331.23999999999995s)]
*  Sanders chip on a shoulder. Now everyone passed me. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  This becomes Aaron Rogers 2.0 if he can ever be even half as good as Aaron [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Rogers. Um, we get to argue about saying the jet, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  the giants trade back in and they take Jackson Dart, right? They pass on Sanders. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=346.88s)]
*  That's going to be fun to monitor. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  I feel like there's going to be some incredible sports media stuff that happens [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=353.0s)]
*  over the next two weeks. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=356.88s)]
*  You can kind of read between the lines on what some of the angles will be. Uh, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  I think people will disgrace themselves. I can't wait. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=362.20000000000005s)]
*  And uh, it's going to be hilarious if Sanders actually ends up being much better [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=365.16s)]
*  than the Jackson Dart. But I don't, I think the thing, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=368.88000000000005s)]
*  the legacy today was neither of those guys are even that good that people were [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=373.0s)]
*  able to get that wound up about it. But maybe, um, maybe tomorrow, but look, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  this is like, I root for, I root for as many good movies as possible. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=382.36s)]
*  I root for as many good TV shows as possible. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=386.8s)]
*  I refer as many good point guards as possible and I root for as many good [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=389.24s)]
*  quarterbacks as possible because I like watching football for 11 hours a day on [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  Sunday. And over and over again, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=398.4s)]
*  we have too many shitty quarterbacks and I hope should or Sanders is good because [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  we need more quarterbacks, but we'll see. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=404.88s)]
*  Hopefully he goes to Cleveland or a team that needs him and he gets to play and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=406.8s)]
*  we'll find out why he dropped to 33. Uh, another angle, Kim Ward, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=410.32s)]
*  poor guy goes number one. Usually that's like, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=415.44s)]
*  I can't, we're talking about him constantly. Oh my God, what do you think? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=418.76s)]
*  How good can he be? What's the ceiling? Can he turn Tennessee around right now? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=422.76s)]
*  Nobody, there were no Kim Ward conversations. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=427.04s)]
*  I think I did multiple draft podcasts. I don't even remember talking about him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=429.48s)]
*  He goes number one, gets immediately overshadowed by this Travis Hunter trade. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=433.32s)]
*  Then there's the Sanders is falling drama that just over overtakes everything. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=437.6s)]
*  And then the giants take up dual Carter, but then they trade back for Jackson [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=443.0s)]
*  darts. So once again, we're not talking about Kim Ward and pussies on Tennessee, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=447.2s)]
*  um, a team that's not very good and a weird start to your career, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=451.2s)]
*  but Hey, good for you. Can't word. I have no idea if you're going to be good. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  It's see there. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=459.96s)]
*  I was reading some stuff where people thought maybe he would have been the fifth [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  or sixth quarterback last year and instead he goes one this year. We'll see. Ah, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=463.52s)]
*  my guy, Will Campbell, who I talked myself into officially today. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  I did a YouTube short. Look, the path senior left tackle. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=470.24s)]
*  This was the case I made in the YouTube short. If you, if they're picking eight, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  I would have been delighted to get them. And if you look at how the draft broke down, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=478.4s)]
*  we had tackles taken for memo to the jets at seven banks went to the saints at [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=482.32s)]
*  nine. Nobody thought banks was going to go in the top 10. Well, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  he did because everybody wants fucking left tackle. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=491.44s)]
*  And that was why we'll Campbell had to be four. And the analogy I made was in 2016, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=494.67999999999995s)]
*  the Celtics took Jaylen Brown because Danny age felt like the league was moving [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  toward wings who could shoot and defend and guard multiple positions. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=503.76s)]
*  Jaylen Brown, if you remember, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=509.24s)]
*  it was supposed to be the seventh or eighth pick on every mock draft. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=510.32s)]
*  They took them third. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  The crowd thought they were the trade that pick for Paul George in Boston or [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=514.68s)]
*  taking Chris Dunn, who was a local Providence guy. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=519.64s)]
*  And there were some booze when they took Jaylen Brown. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=523.08s)]
*  And then he turned out to be Jaylen Brown. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=525.84s)]
*  My point is just because you got a guy who probably should have gone six [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=528.72s)]
*  seven eight with the fourth pick, what are they going to do? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=533.76s)]
*  They were, there were two drafts. There were the first three guys. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=537.08s)]
*  Then there was everybody else. And if you look at the way the guys four through [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=539.72s)]
*  12, it became one of those beauties. The eye of the beholder drafts, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=544.16s)]
*  right? Campbell goes to New England, Graham goes to Cleveland. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=549.12s)]
*  Gentie goes to Vegas six membo goes to the jet seven. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=551.96s)]
*  Uh, Tep Macmillan goes to Carolina at eight banks goes ninth and Loveland [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=557.88s)]
*  goes over Tyler Warren at 10. And it's just like, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=562.4s)]
*  you could have done this draft two weeks ago and that order might've been [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=566.52s)]
*  completely different. So I just think with, with Campbell, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=569.52s)]
*  um, they need a left tackle. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=574.8s)]
*  They have nobody who can block and the most important guy in the team plays [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=577.3199999999999s)]
*  quarterback. And if he could be the 12th best left tackle in the league, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=580.4s)]
*  you got to do it. Now, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=585.36s)]
*  a couple other Will Campbell things that have gotten me really excited. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=586.56s)]
*  He talked about, I talked about this with Shregger the other day, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=589.84s)]
*  Vrabel did put on the pads and he did go at Campbell to kind of feel what his [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=592.76s)]
*  body was. And I had been hearing about this for a week or so. And Campbell, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=597.76s)]
*  I guess knocked them over and Vrabel was really impressed by that. But, um, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=601.84s)]
*  Vrabel I've got to confirm multiple ways. Now he loves putting the pads on, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=605.72s)]
*  hitting the guys, feeling their body mass, feeling how sturdy they are. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=609.92s)]
*  So love Will Campbell, um, grew up in Monroe, Louisiana, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=612.84s)]
*  home of bill Russell, not nothing. He cried for 25 seconds. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=618.24s)]
*  On stage today after he got drafted. Um, I got a little choked up. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=622.36s)]
*  He said, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=627.48s)]
*  I'm going to fight and die to protect them with everything I got. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=627.96s)]
*  When was asked about how are you going to protect Drake May? I repeat, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to fight and die to protect them with everything I got. Um, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=634.32s)]
*  I'm all in on this guy. There's, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  there's been a lot of jokes in the Boston area. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  It's been a pretty polarizing pick. Um, there was a tweet, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=644.2s)]
*  I forget who did it. It was one of the, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=648.24s)]
*  I think WV guys that it was showed a picture of him crying and it was like, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  Will Campbell's arms are too short to wipe away the tears. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=653.3599999999999s)]
*  We're going to get a lot of that. Will Campbell, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=656.52s)]
*  I think it's an inch difference. It doesn't phase me. Um, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=658.5999999999999s)]
*  I think we get in trouble with drafts when people don't fit the boxes we have [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=663.76s)]
*  for the types of bodies. And the reason I mentioned this, um, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=667.92s)]
*  with the basketball analogy is because we watched Jaylen Brunson on the next [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=672.8s)]
*  night as well. Campbell's getting drafted, who has now become one of the, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=677.0s)]
*  I think 10 best players in the league, 10 or 12 best players. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=681.64s)]
*  He fell to the second round in the NBA draft cause he was too short. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=684.36s)]
*  Wasn't fast enough. Like I, you know, I'm, I'm in my fifties now. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=687.56s)]
*  We've been doing this with drafts my whole life. What the centers, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=692.64s)]
*  an inch to dream on green falls to 37 in the draft. Cause what is he? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=696.4s)]
*  Is the center? Can he shoot? Um, these guys don't fit in boxes. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=700.64s)]
*  And if we'll Campbell has been awesome his whole career and the one catch on [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=705.12s)]
*  him is his arms might be an inch too short. Like guess what? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=708.8s)]
*  We need a left tackle. Hopefully his arms start too short. So I'm in on this pick. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm going to defend it. I signed off on it. I think they did the right thing. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=717.64s)]
*  I asked, I think nobody wanted to trade up. So, um, that was it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=720.9599999999999s)]
*  So Loveland went over tie warrants of the bears at 10 because, uh, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=724.68s)]
*  Ben Johnson, he always needs a tight end. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=729.16s)]
*  Meanwhile anyone who spent $30 on same reporter in their draft last year, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=731.16s)]
*  wanted to, wanted to punch themselves in the face. So we'll see how Loveland does. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=734.84s)]
*  Um, I don't know. Is that, are the bears fallen victim to, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  we have Caleb Williams. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=744.4s)]
*  Let's just keep drafting offensive weapons and not building a right team around [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=745.64s)]
*  them. We'll see if they spend a lot of money in the offensive line. Uh, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  I didn't love that pick, but, uh, the picks that I did love. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=752.96s)]
*  And granted I parachuted into this, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=757.84s)]
*  but I did really get into the draft this year cause of the path situation. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=759.32s)]
*  I really thought they were going to trade back. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=762.36s)]
*  So I was kind of looking at 20 guys and doing the deep dives on them. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=763.8s)]
*  So the picks that I did like Jalen Walker fell to Atlanta at 15 and he was one [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=767.92s)]
*  of the ones that seemed like he was a fast riser, um, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=773.76s)]
*  down the stretch and he was even getting rumored for a second at four. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=777.3599999999999s)]
*  Peter Schrager was doing his whole, um, to a man. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  People will tell you that this guy just wows the room. He's one of those, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=785.76s)]
*  like great character wows the room guy felt a 15 to a team that, uh, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=790.28s)]
*  never seems to have a pass rush. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=794.52s)]
*  So I really liked that pick for them and it just felt like they got good value. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=796.12s)]
*  I loved Hampton to the chargers at 22, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=800.28s)]
*  who everyone thought was the second best running back in this draft. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=803.56s)]
*  And maybe some people felt like the distance between him and gente wasn't really [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=806.64s)]
*  even that significant. Um, this guy just seems like a kickass bang, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=811.5799999999999s)]
*  bang the line, keep, keep the chains moving guy. Um, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=816.4399999999999s)]
*  and they needed somebody like this. And I just thought at 22, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=820.92s)]
*  that's where you want to take a running back. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=823.64s)]
*  And then Matthew golden went 23 to the Packers. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=825.24s)]
*  I'm just going to say this. I I'm going to make a prediction. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=829.36s)]
*  I think he's going to be better than Macmillan. Uh, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=832.28s)]
*  and I'll get to Macmillan in a second. Um, and then I liked that, uh, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=835.04s)]
*  I liked that Houston was able to trade 25 for 34 99 and a third round pick [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  because the giants got excited about Jackson Dart, who might be a career backup. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=844.72s)]
*  But I thought that was smart that they were loading up on picks cause they need [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=848.6s)]
*  stuff. My favorite dumb trade was, uh, Atlanta traded, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=851.48s)]
*  number 46, number two 42 and a 2026 first round pick to the Rams for number 26. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=856.36s)]
*  And, uh, I just, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=867.32s)]
*  I love having the Falcons with this current administration in the draft. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=869.84s)]
*  It's like in my, in my vote out draft with sound, those guys, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=873.34s)]
*  we have our crazy friend Brad's in there and you just never know where you're [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=877.12s)]
*  getting every year with Brad this year. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=880.08s)]
*  He took like nine or 10 running backs and it was just like, of course he did. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  He's Brad. That's basically become the Falcons. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=885.4000000000001s)]
*  Nobody moves up 20 spots from 46 to 26 and gives a first round pick in a draft [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  where we were by the time we got to the mid twenties, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=896.0s)]
*  I don't think anyone was doing backflips. I thought that was hilarious. Uh, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=898.9000000000001s)]
*  I thought it was a very fun draft for glass half empty stereotypes. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  Will Campbell has short arms. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=906.88s)]
*  Gentie runs with his pads too high. Apparently heard that one a couple of times. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=909.12s)]
*  Membo you can see this in the ringer draft guide was called a, a, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=914.2s)]
*  a leaner and a lunger, which I think are bad traits for, uh, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=918.12s)]
*  for a tackle apparently. But my number one, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=922.02s)]
*  and this is why I didn't like the tech MacBillan pick was, uh, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=924.96s)]
*  and I thought that was the worst pick. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=927.8s)]
*  I thought him going to the Panthers at eight was the worst pick in the draft. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=930.32s)]
*  We'll see if I'm right or wrong, but, uh, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=934.1199999999999s)]
*  tech MacBillan can't get enough separation was the thing that people were [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=937.3599999999999s)]
*  hanging on. There was also the, he loves volleyball more than football. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=941.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to acknowledge that they can't get enough separation. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=944.28s)]
*  I think is a real thing because the Patriots over and over again have drafted [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  receivers or, or signed receivers like the Vante Parker who the guys are never [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  open because they can't get any separation. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=956.66s)]
*  And then the quarterback has to make like perfect throws just to get in the ball. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=959.16s)]
*  You see these highlights of these guys in college, making one-handed catches, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=962.7600000000001s)]
*  jumping over five, nine defensive backs. And I just, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=965.84s)]
*  I want guys who are wide open from draft and receiver. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=969.72s)]
*  I want somebody like golden where you see the clips and he's just like wide open [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=973.2600000000001s)]
*  in all the clips. I want guys like that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=977.08s)]
*  I don't care about the guys who can make the catches in traffic. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=979.44s)]
*  It seems like those guys are more likely to bust than anything. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=982.6s)]
*  So that I would say out of all the half glass, half empty stereotypes, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=986.12s)]
*  that's the one I might, I might believe in most mainly because I've been burned by [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=990.24s)]
*  20 plus years of terrible Patriots picks. Uh, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=995.48s)]
*  another big takeaway from this draft, which I think people say any week, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=999.48s)]
*  every year, but I was really thinking about it this year. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1003.64s)]
*  Why do people go to the NFL draft? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1006.2s)]
*  I feel like I get 99.9% of the sports fan experience, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1009.32s)]
*  which is a reason that I think I've had some success over the years. Um, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1014.76s)]
*  this I don't get. And I was thinking like [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1020.2s)]
*  during the darkest, most interesting, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1025.64s)]
*  most board stretches of my entire life, which is probably my mid twenties. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1028.56s)]
*  Um, when I was broke and barely employed or unemployed sometimes or semi employed [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1034.72s)]
*  and then employed again, uh, my mom was paying my mobile gas card, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1041.68s)]
*  was charging soda food on it. Um, hoping she would've noticed. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1046.96s)]
*  Even then my darkest moments, I never would have wanted to go to the NFL draft. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't have wanted to go if it was in Boston, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1058.12s)]
*  much less driving to Foxborough to go. I just don't get it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1060.36s)]
*  And I'm not saying I'm right or wrong. I just don't personally understand it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1065.36s)]
*  I don't get it. And maybe if van pops on here in a second, I'll ask him. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh, but everybody seems like they have a great time, but this year specifically [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1074.48s)]
*  to go to green Bay, which is a really hard place to, to go to, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1078.44s)]
*  to find a hotel. It's hard that the airport situation is a disaster. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1082.56s)]
*  I just, I don't get it. Uh, I also didn't get, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1087.04s)]
*  um, why Roger Goodell came out on a bike. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  And I don't get in general why he tries so hard to pretend he's like this [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1095.96s)]
*  great, awesome guy when we all know he's, he's, you know, he's, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1101.28s)]
*  he's a business assassin. That's the reason he's stayed the commissioner of the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1106.96s)]
*  song, but you're not going to fool us riding a bike and bear hugging, uh, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1110.56s)]
*  teammates or draft picks. Um, one other note, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1113.92s)]
*  the giants triple downed on their defensive line. And it's fun. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1120.28s)]
*  I have a lot of giants fans in my life to make fun of them about this because [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1124.48s)]
*  they immediately default to the first Superbowl went over the paths. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1127.76s)]
*  We'll work that out for us in 2007. Um, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1131.4s)]
*  it's not going to work out this time because the rest of your team really sucks. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1135.96s)]
*  And your quarterbacks are Jackson Dart and Tommy DeVito and Russell Wilson and [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1139.0s)]
*  Jamis Winston. And I wish you all a lot of luck. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1143.52s)]
*  And I still hate you for 2007 and 2011. So I just want to get that in, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1145.76s)]
*  but this is the Mike Lombardi theory with, uh, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1150.0s)]
*  if you have a strength double down on the strength is one of my favorite [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1153.64s)]
*  Lombardi theories, um, that we'll see this, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1157.28s)]
*  this giant thing will be a good example. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1160.92s)]
*  Can we be really awesome at one part of football and can we be so awesome at it [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1162.68s)]
*  that will actually transfer to the, uh, the rest of football? Um, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1166.84s)]
*  those are all my notes. The only, the only thing about people going in the draft, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1172.04s)]
*  I did enjoy when, when, uh, the Packer fans booed the bears, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1175.3999999999999s)]
*  Steve McMichael came on, they had the memorial, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1179.28s)]
*  the moment of silence or whatever happened there. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1181.96s)]
*  And the crowd got respectful for a second and then went back to bust them, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1184.48s)]
*  the bears again, that whole Packers bear thing is really funny. And, uh, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1187.52s)]
*  and I enjoy that. I still don't know why you would stand there as people got [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1192.0s)]
*  picked. I just don't get it. I'm not, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1195.56s)]
*  I'm not trying to sound superior to people. I, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1198.16s)]
*  I just don't personally understand it. So if anyone can explain it to me, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1200.92s)]
*  I'd love to, uh, I'd love to know more. Uh, all right. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  So Rudy, you have, do you have a take on this? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  I have no idea why people are there. I don't, I don't get it at all. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1210.72s)]
*  I don't get it. What do they do between the picks? Yeah. Cause they, they, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1214.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, it's like, I guess the whole point would be like, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1219.76s)]
*  can you get on TV to be the one giants fan, like holding up your Jersey and just [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1221.96s)]
*  yelling like Jackson Dart? I don't know. I don't know. I don't get it. And like, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1225.92s)]
*  you know, maybe we're just really out of touch and like losers. I don't, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1230.52s)]
*  I don't know. Like I'm trying not to be like the anti-fun guy, but I just, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1233.24s)]
*  I don't get how I was. I literally asked my wife, I was like, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1236.88s)]
*  would you rather be in Times Square for new year's Eve or at the NFL draft? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1239.2s)]
*  And she was like, I honestly don't know. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1243.56s)]
*  New year's Eve is a good example. Cause I don't get that either, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1246.48s)]
*  but I, at least I get it a little bit. Cause it's something to do on new years. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1249.16s)]
*  It's like what'd you do? We went to Times Square. We had to do it. Yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1253.08s)]
*  It seems awful. Yep. But then if a draft seems, can you drink at this? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1256.12s)]
*  Like do they sell food? They must. Right. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1260.8s)]
*  And I mean, you're so far away from the state. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1263.84s)]
*  Like they were doing the aerial shots and you're not even close to the stage. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1266.6s)]
*  I mean the people close to the stage, I don't even think, you know, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1269.84s)]
*  like I would say 95% of the audience was not even remotely near the stage area. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1273.16s)]
*  You're just like in this parking lot behind it. I don't know. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  It looks like you're like at a concert at Wembley stadium. Correct. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1281.0400000000002s)]
*  And you're way in the back, like watching, you know, whoever. Yeah. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1284.68s)]
*  Do you feel the same way about the NBA draft? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1289.72s)]
*  No, cause it's a little more confined. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1292.72s)]
*  This just seems like this massive sporting event that I just don't get it. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1296.24s)]
*  Do you agree with me on Mcdowell? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1301.24s)]
*  Maybe it's just a party, get hammered and you know, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1302.5600000000002s)]
*  maybe that's just the cell, which, you know, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1305.4s)]
*  it's a rose trip and you just get there and everybody's kind of, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  you're running Airbnb for a weekend and you just kind of do your thing. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1310.48s)]
*  Maybe that's a, maybe that's fun. Yeah. That's the thing is I don't, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1312.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying I I'm leaving the door open that I'm completely wrong and I'm [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1315.76s)]
*  just not seeing it correctly, but I don't see it in any way. Uh, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1319.5600000000002s)]
*  do you think Sanders should have fallen in the second round? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1323.72s)]
*  I feel like I like him more than the consensus does, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1325.52s)]
*  like all these GMs and anonymous. I love the anonymous thing too. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1331.0s)]
*  It was like there was people trying to out anonymous everyone else with [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1334.76s)]
*  anonymous quotes. Uh, I don't know. I mean, I, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1338.4s)]
*  I obviously wasn't in any of the meetings with the guy, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1341.6399999999999s)]
*  but I kind of respected him. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1343.48s)]
*  Like he seems like he's got a decent head on his shoulders, given who he is, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1344.8799999999999s)]
*  who his dad is. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1348.04s)]
*  And he got his ass kicked at Colorado almost every single week and really never [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1349.44s)]
*  complained. It was just a baller. So I don't know. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1353.88s)]
*  I'm not a talent evaluator, but I, I respect his game, but clearly there's just, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1356.68s)]
*  I think, you know, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1361.7600000000002s)]
*  it was weird on the broadcast cause they, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1363.3200000000002s)]
*  they just kind of refused to ever say like, Hey, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1365.0s)]
*  maybe he's just not that talented. And that's why he's not, they kept, you know, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1366.7600000000002s)]
*  Kuyper kept bringing it up. They kept talking about how, you know, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1370.5200000000002s)]
*  about his dad showing him and it was kind of awkward. And maybe it's just, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1373.24s)]
*  Hey, he's not that good of an arm strength guy. And you know, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1376.4s)]

*  And I had to give you the floor because I know you watched him, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1556.08s)]
*  not just at Colorado, but even before that, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1560.08s)]
*  we surprised that he fell in the second round in a league where half [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1562.8s)]
*  the teams seem like they're not happy with who their quarterback is. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1567.64s)]
*  I was as surprised with his fall as I was with Anthony Richardson's [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1570.76s)]
*  rise when he was going through the process because I'd watched so much of him. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1575.32s)]
*  I watched so much of him and I had seen him like never really play [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  competent quarterback at Florida outside of some moments and a couple of [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1583.32s)]
*  games with should door. It's completely the opposite. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1588.6s)]
*  I expected that the measurables wouldn't be crazy because when you watch him, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1594.0s)]
*  you think sometimes is he a new alarm? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1597.6399999999999s)]
*  He obviously isn't hyper twitchy as far as his movement when he [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1600.72s)]
*  decides to run. However, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1605.56s)]
*  just watching him as a football player, as a football player, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1608.0800000000002s)]
*  he won games and he changed programs when he got to, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1613.76s)]
*  you know, the destinations that, that, that he ended up in college football. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1619.44s)]
*  Now, a lot of people might say, Hey, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1622.92s)]
*  his record at Colorado was mediocre and it was, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1624.8000000000002s)]
*  but if you look at what Colorado was before he got there, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1628.3200000000002s)]
*  a lot of that offense is on his shoulders and he always made plays. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1632.64s)]
*  And he seemed like the kind of guy that you would want at quarterback in terms [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1636.3999999999999s)]
*  of the toughness, the ability to make throws and big moments, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1639.6799999999998s)]
*  the ability to make big game winning drives. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1644.8799999999999s)]
*  He's getting his ass kicked. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1648.1599999999999s)]
*  But when it was time to, to, to, to measure out and I get, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1651.76s)]
*  get in front of people, I guess they didn't like what they saw. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1655.52s)]
*  Yeah. The two things that don't make sense to me, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1658.4399999999998s)]
*  big games on the road with crowds, right? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1661.9199999999998s)]
*  Making plays, making, making clutch plays every once in a while, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1666.36s)]
*  like what she definitely did. Like he seemed like he had a knack for the moment. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1669.6799999999998s)]
*  And then you mentioned the key thing, how freaking tough he was, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1673.08s)]
*  which I think when you're at the next level, you're just going to, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1677.08s)]
*  either you're going to stand in the pocket and take hits or you're not. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1680.32s)]
*  We've seen so many quarterbacks who seem like they're afraid to get hit. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying he should have gone 10th or 12th, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1686.56s)]
*  but it's hard for me to believe once we get into the twenties with how hard it is [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1689.7199999999998s)]
*  to find a quarterback that he wouldn't have gone in twenties, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1693.04s)]
*  which makes me think they thought he was like Andy Dalton, basically, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1697.92s)]
*  like a poor man's Andy Dalton. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1701.12s)]
*  Well, man, you watch Jackson Dart and, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1702.92s)]
*  and especially the Florida game was not a, not a pretty watch. Right. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1705.68s)]
*  But you know, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1710.24s)]
*  he's got the arm strength and I guess more of the ideal athleticism. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1711.92s)]
*  He runs a little bit better than Chador does. I, it, I don't know. Like, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1715.4s)]
*  it's, it's one of those things where, cause you're right. Like he, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1719.36s)]
*  like Colorado's defense was terrible both years he was there and he carried them [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1721.84s)]
*  to ranked to, you know, Colorado being a ranked team for most of the time. He's, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1726.08s)]
*  he's an impressive dude to me, but clearly, you know, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1730.84s)]
*  if you don't have a good arm, like the, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1734.6s)]
*  like the Anthony Richardson thing, like dudes get tricked into that all the time, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1736.24s)]
*  you know, right? The guys he's six foot five, he's built like an Adonis. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1739.96s)]
*  He runs well. The one throw, the one throw he had last year off his back foot, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1743.2s)]
*  you know, they'll show that highlight for years to come. It's like, all right, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1747.76s)]
*  we'll bank on that guy. It's hard to bank on a guy who, all right, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1749.84s)]
*  what's his main trait? Like he's tough and he's, he's kind of accurate, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1753.08s)]
*  or he's pretty accurate, but he doesn't have a great arm. Like, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1756.52s)]
*  see, this is what I would say about that. I understand what you're saying. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1760.28s)]
*  Just, I want to, you know, Richardson in NFL now, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1764.52s)]
*  he just was the example that popped in my head, but like, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1767.48s)]
*  I watched him like legitimately struggle to grasp his offense and to be [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1770.6000000000001s)]
*  consistently productive in it. And all year long, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1776.0s)]
*  there were narratives about whether or not the guy was hurt or, or, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1780.1599999999999s)]
*  or what was the reason that he couldn't play? You know, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1783.08s)]
*  I can't really say that about Jackson Dart. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1786.12s)]
*  What I can say about Jackson Dart is that there are times in big moments and big [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1787.7199999999998s)]
*  games where Jackson Dart wasn't there. And there are, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1791.6s)]
*  there were weird off games where it seemed like teams kind of had ganged out, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1795.28s)]
*  um, uh, uh, Kiffin scheme a little bit, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1800.8400000000001s)]
*  and they were able to shut down Jackson Dart and, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1803.7600000000002s)]
*  and render him ineffective. But when you look at the team, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1807.7600000000002s)]
*  Ole Miss's team from, from last year, they spent a lot of money. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1811.0800000000002s)]
*  Trey Harris was hurt most of the year. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1814.6000000000001s)]
*  That was a guy who probably would have been a first round pick at receiver and [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1816.2s)]
*  then Juce Wells, the big transfer that came in from South Carolina, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1822.0400000000002s)]
*  he didn't work out. He had a disappointing season. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1826.3200000000002s)]
*  So it wasn't like they had explosion all over the office. They had Ulysses Bentley. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1828.56s)]
*  They had some other guys in the backfield that, um, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1833.12s)]
*  were running the ball pretty well. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1835.84s)]
*  But the team was a little bit off kilter Dart was shouldering a lot, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1837.6399999999999s)]
*  a lot of the load for them offensively because they weren't really getting [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1844.04s)]
*  separation from their wide receivers. And a lot of stuff was going on there. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1850.08s)]
*  Two things I'll say differently though. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1853.76s)]
*  He had a multi multi million dollar squad. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1855.8s)]
*  There were dudes or supposed dudes everywhere. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1860.96s)]
*  The reason why you would say that should do or Sanders, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  you have to call them clutch is because Colorado was incapable of dominating [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1867.48s)]
*  anyone. If they were going to win a game, it was normally going to be by six. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1871.8799999999999s)]
*  It was going to be by three and should door was going to have to make plays for [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1876.96s)]
*  them to win. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1881.8799999999999s)]
*  Can it be 50 to 40? Yeah. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1882.92s)]
*  He was going to have to make plays for them to win. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1885.0s)]
*  And I'm just surprised that no one saw when you talk about the intangibles, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1888.44s)]
*  a lot of people are talking about, well, he's bad at an interview. He's cocky. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1892.28s)]
*  He's this, he's that the intangibles that I saw was a guy who was able to rally [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1896.28s)]
*  his team and get them to really play for him. A guy who stood in there, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1901.2s)]
*  I'll get behind one of the worst offensive lines I've ever seen in college [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1905.68s)]
*  football history. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1911.3600000000001s)]
*  Like one of the worst lines I've ever seen and make plays and deliver throws. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1912.76s)]
*  And there was a throw in that not to to filibuster belabor it. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1918.04s)]
*  There was a throw I specifically remember in the North Dakota state game where [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  he gets drilled and the ball comes out and I'm thinking that's a pick. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1929.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm like, Oh my God, that's a pick. No, he floated it to horn, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1933.92s)]
*  horn ran under it. And I think that he scored. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1937.24s)]
*  So I just thought that somebody would say that's a guy that I could build an [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1939.88s)]
*  offense around, particularly one of these obviously dumb teams, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1943.3600000000001s)]
*  but I guess it didn't, they didn't feel that way. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1947.02s)]
*  Well, I talked about this earlier, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1951.0400000000002s)]
*  but wouldn't it be amazing if he ended up in Cleveland when we thought there was [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1953.0s)]
*  a chance he could have gone to Cleveland before people realized it was in top [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1956.96s)]
*  three. But now he could go to Cleveland, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1960.0s)]
*  a team that has been in hell with their quarterback since Baker Mayfield left. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1962.72s)]
*  And now he goes there. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  He'd have a wide open runway to be good right away. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1969.0400000000002s)]
*  He'd have a better offensive line than he had a Colorado. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1973.0s)]
*  But that's the thing I was, man, where would you want to see him? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1976.48s)]
*  Cause I was thinking during the draft and like, does he, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1979.1200000000001s)]
*  does he fit well in New York or Cleveland in a cold weather city where like he's [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1981.3200000000002s)]
*  got to drive the ball and what could be bad weather? Like he's, you know, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1985.16s)]
*  the saints in a dome, like that feels just way, way bad. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1988.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the exact fit is, but I didn't know if he's a saint. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1991.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. What about your saints? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1993.84s)]
*  I mean, look at this point, you know, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=1997.84s)]
*  I take Lucifer at quarterback rather than Derek Carr. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2000.28s)]
*  Like there are all kinds of people like OJ Simpson could quarterback us. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2003.6399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? Kanye West. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2007.3999999999999s)]
*  But there are a lot of people that I would, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2009.36s)]
*  that they could put in their quarterback right now that I take over Derek Carr, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2010.6799999999998s)]
*  pretty much like anybody. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2013.76s)]
*  But look, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2016.8799999999999s)]
*  there's no doubt that in the right situation, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2018.12s)]
*  Shadour Sanders has what it takes to be successful. What I am not, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2022.68s)]
*  I'm a guy who watches a lot of college football. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2027.16s)]
*  Like I watched every snap that Dart took this year. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2029.44s)]
*  I watched every snap that Sanders took this year, right? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2033.0s)]
*  I just watch every game possible and especially the teams in the, in the SEC. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2036.28s)]
*  I have to watch them. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2040.84s)]
*  What I can't do is get granular as far as the breakdown [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2041.68s)]
*  of what NFL guys see that makes them go, Oh my God, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2046.88s)]
*  this guy is undraftable. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2051.08s)]
*  I can only tell you the tape that I saw like when they were playing games, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2052.7599999999998s)]
*  actual games on a football field and on a football field, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2057.72s)]
*  it seems like Shadour Sanders is a winning player. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2062.0s)]
*  Jackson Dart is a great big strong guy who's incredibly tough, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2064.12s)]
*  incredibly tough, but I don't know, man, that offense is, is, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2068.64s)]
*  it's, it's designed to manufacture statistics. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2072.84s)]
*  It's a simple offense because they go so fast. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2078.04s)]
*  So there's just a lot of things that Jackson Dart might be asked to do on the [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2080.52s)]
*  next level that I don't think he was asked to do it almost. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2084.16s)]
*  Handsome guy. Um, maybe that'll be his legacy. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2087.2s)]
*  Handsome guy coming in and it seems like he's like Brad Pitt's coming in. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2091.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, Cleveland has 33 and 36. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2096.2s)]
*  The two teams between them are Houston who already have a quarterback in [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2100.08s)]
*  Tennessee who just drafted a quarterback. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2103.92s)]
*  And if they passed on him twice when their quarterbacks are Kenny Pickett [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2106.6s)]
*  and Deshaun Watson who's out for the year and who everybody in Cleveland hates, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2112.16s)]
*  that is just damning. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2117.16s)]
*  And then you go to the Raiders are sitting there at 37 and could they try to [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2118.4s)]
*  move up? Like, I can't imagine him getting by at 37. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2124.08s)]
*  Then it's like, all right, what the fuck's going on? Van, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2128.68s)]
*  when does this become one of the most reprehensible sports media people [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2130.7599999999998s)]
*  yelling at each other's stories we've had in a while? What, what needs to happen? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2135.52s)]
*  Yocan, Yocan versus Embiid for the MVP was the last time it got really dark. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2139.2000000000003s)]
*  I got drawn into that. Yeah. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2144.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2147.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, I don't know. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2148.0s)]
*  The cultural story of this one is, is pretty big as well. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2149.96s)]
*  Like I saw Dion get at Dan O'Losky on Twitter and yeah, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2155.48s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody said that Dan O'Losky is, um, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2160.48s)]
*  is a hater now because, um, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2164.32s)]
*  he gave a somewhat negative, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2167.7200000000003s)]
*  uh, opinion about Shadour Sanders. And it wasn't really a negative opinion. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  He said, if Shadour Sanders doesn't go in the first round or if a couple of [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2175.52s)]
*  things pass on him, this will be why these are the things that he needs to work [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2179.1600000000003s)]
*  on. And someone comes and says, I didn't know he was a hater. And Dion goes, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2181.96s)]
*  Oh my God, he's a hater. The Dion part of this just cannot be overlooked. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2184.84s)]
*  The fact that, uh, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2189.32s)]
*  Dion is such a gigantic personality that [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2191.6000000000004s)]
*  maybe there are some people that have been rubbed the wrong way, uh, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2196.7200000000003s)]
*  by the entire Colorado apparatus. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2201.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, and that is the thing that's going to be gnawing [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2206.8s)]
*  at the talking heads for the next couple of days because, you know, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2211.32s)]
*  quarterbacks fall all the time, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2216.1600000000003s)]
*  but this one's going to be seen as a gigantic injustice where it could be just [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2217.76s)]
*  a guy that the NFL scouts don't like, or it could be more. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  The injustice to me is that we don't have enough good quarterbacks. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2226.0s)]
*  So you have to really think this guy doesn't have it. If you're like, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2229.6400000000003s)]
*  we still don't know who the Steelers quarterback is. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2233.88s)]
*  So Rudy, is it like Kirk Cousins now? Like what, is it like, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2235.88s)]
*  like really they're going to do the Aaron Rodgers roller coaster, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2241.0400000000004s)]
*  kind of keep their fingers crossed for a guy who seemed like he was washed last [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2244.0s)]
*  year. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2247.68s)]
*  But I would say the counterpoint would be every, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2248.52s)]
*  every draft expert has basically told us that like Cam Ward in last year's draft [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2251.8s)]
*  is going what, like fifth or sixth of all of the quarterbacks. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2256.48s)]
*  So if you think Cam Ward is better than Chidora Sanders, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2259.8s)]
*  which I think we all probably do at least as a prospect, that's, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2263.0s)]
*  that means he's at least seventh, the seventh best quarterback in, you know, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2266.2400000000002s)]
*  and how many, how many times there's seven quarterbacks go in round one. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  So is he just being, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2272.96s)]
*  was he just kind of being propped up because Hey, we need to latch onto somebody. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2274.0s)]
*  Quarterbacks are sexy. Usually two to three go in the first round. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2277.6000000000004s)]
*  Like maybe he's up there when like, you know, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2280.88s)]
*  I guess the statistic would tell you that this draft is just not a great [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2283.7200000000003s)]
*  quarterback draft. So I don't know. Like it seems, I really don't know what to believe. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2286.88s)]
*  Yeah. That's what happens with these clusters with the draft, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2291.4s)]
*  where you're the best looking person in your cluster, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2294.04s)]
*  but it's not a good cluster. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2298.88s)]
*  And you can fool people into thinking you're better than you are. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2300.56s)]
*  I thought that was really interesting that people, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2303.3599999999997s)]
*  I saw the same stuff that people thought like Bo Nicks would have gone ahead of [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2305.56s)]
*  Cam Ward. If they were in the same draft, that's crazy. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2309.72s)]
*  I guess, yeah, I get what you're saying, but I looked at that. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2314.7599999999998s)]
*  So really from a different perspective to where it's a weak quarterback draft, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2318.8799999999997s)]
*  like a weak one, right? And he still fell out of the top, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2324.8799999999997s)]
*  out of the first round. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2329.72s)]
*  Like we watched a draft where Michael Pinnix with a really [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2331.4s)]
*  questionable medical, like that guy's a stuck quarterback, don't get me wrong. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2336.2s)]
*  And he ran four or five when he was at the combine. So obviously, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2339.96s)]
*  his legs worked, but we watched him get taken. We watched, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2343.72s)]
*  the JJ McCarthy thing still blows my mind, right? And it's not, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2348.64s)]
*  I'm not saying that the guy's not good. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2352.12s)]
*  I'm saying that we're talking about someone that was in a hand the ball off, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2353.8s)]
*  make a couple of plays of game offense, right? Game manager, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2358.3199999999997s)]
*  he is about to be handed the keys to the kingdom up in Minnesota. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2363.3999999999996s)]
*  All of that stuff together. I know that the team won a lot and that's got to mean [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2367.4399999999996s)]
*  something, but I'm saying now it just seems like it wasn't that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2370.56s)]
*  Shadour Sanders didn't find the right fit in the first round. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2375.3199999999997s)]
*  It seemed like he was radioactive, which it wasn't. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2379.52s)]
*  Well, it does seem like the interviews were a real thing. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2383.68s)]
*  Right. So it was. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2386.88s)]
*  People were being anonymous because they didn't want people coming at them, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2388.4s)]
*  but it didn't seem like a fake story. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2392.0s)]
*  It did seem like something that turned some teams off. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2395.48s)]
*  But can I ask you a question? Let's say that it's not a fake story. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2398.64s)]
*  The question is, why is it a story? Why would an anonymous source, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2402.08s)]
*  you have a bad interview with Shadour Sanders. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2407.6s)]
*  Right. Why are they saying anything? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2410.0s)]
*  I'm just asking. Yeah. By the way, I'm not, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2411.04s)]
*  I'm not casting any type of expression. I'm saying, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2413.16s)]
*  I'm asking why. Like you have a bad interview with Shadour Sanders. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2415.8s)]
*  Or you take it out because you want to get him the second round. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2418.92s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, that guy's a fucking asshole. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2421.1600000000003s)]
*  And meanwhile, you're like, I hope he falls to 33. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2423.1200000000003s)]
*  But it got to a point to where every single fucking thing was so negative. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2425.44s)]
*  Like, did you hear that we watched him tie his shoes [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2431.92s)]
*  and it took him fucking five seconds to do the loop de loop? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2437.04s)]
*  Something's wrong with this guy. He's undraftable. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2441.44s)]
*  It was like the Draft Day movie. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2443.52s)]
*  It was the birthday party. It was Bo Kalhan. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2445.16s)]
*  The whole thing. So I'm just, you know, I'm by the way, I'm not, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2450.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying that this was pretty remarkable for from a guy. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2453.0s)]
*  There's that other tweet from Dion where Dion is saying, hey, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2457.16s)]
*  my son's going to go top five. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2459.3999999999996s)]
*  So really, like everyone was saying that he was going to be like a top five draft pick. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2460.44s)]
*  Some people say that word for three months, but that cooled off the last couple of days. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2465.92s)]
*  It did. You know that it almost last couple of weeks. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2470.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2474.04s)]
*  But it almost feels like did we just kind of like talk ourselves into something [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2475.2s)]
*  that was never actually going to be real, you know? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2479.3199999999997s)]
*  And I know as a Patriots fan, hoping that two quarterbacks were going top three, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2482.3599999999997s)]
*  you could feel it shifting in fucking February [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2487.64s)]
*  that once the first wave of analysis came in on him, it wasn't it was pretty bleak. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2491.08s)]
*  So I don't get it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2497.08s)]
*  There's one other thing that I look back at it and I was like, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2498.6s)]
*  these things didn't help, at least to me. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2504.24s)]
*  So Ken Ward and Shadour Sanders trained together. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2507.44s)]
*  And so all throughout the last couple of months, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2511.12s)]
*  there were all of these training videos of them and they were throwing together. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2514.9199999999996s)]
*  And, you know, Ward would step up and he would throw a couple of reps [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2520.24s)]
*  and then Shadour would step up and he would throw a couple of reps. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2524.68s)]
*  And I remember watching both of those guys throw and be like, oh, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2527.24s)]
*  you know, like, don't get me wrong, Shadour throws a pretty football. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2530.36s)]
*  I think he's a first round quarterback. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2535.36s)]
*  I think he's going to have a successful NFL career. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2537.2s)]
*  But the physical difference between the guys was was was was pretty [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2539.6s)]
*  remarkable when you watch both of them throw. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2543.2s)]
*  Dan, can we go rapid fire really quick? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2545.36s)]
*  Will Campbell, number four Patriots. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2547.24s)]
*  His arms are apparently an inch too short. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  I've talked myself into the pick, but you loved him. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2553.2s)]
*  Can you make a comment about that? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2555.48s)]
*  I've talked myself into the pick, but you loved him. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2556.7999999999997s)]
*  Can you make the Will Campbell face case for my Patriot fan friends? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2559.16s)]
*  All I can say is that the guy faced some of the best, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2563.56s)]
*  most talented pass rushers in the entire country, and he didn't hold up. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2566.8799999999997s)]
*  He fucking dominated. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2571.64s)]
*  He dominated. He didn't. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2573.3599999999997s)]
*  He wasn't a this is a guy who can hold up at tackle for you. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2576.2s)]
*  This was a dominating pass blocker. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2581.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm sorry, man. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2585.92s)]
*  Actual game shit has to matter. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2587.2s)]
*  He is a dog. You guys got to go. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2589.48s)]
*  Did it make you cry when he cried? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2592.88s)]
*  No, I thought I thought it was actually more interesting that [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2595.72s)]
*  when he was walking up to the podium to go talk to the Dell, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2598.72s)]
*  that he completely ignored Brian. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2602.8s)]
*  That like that that freaked me out as a fan. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2606.08s)]
*  I'm wondering, they fuck with this guy. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2609.7599999999998s)]
*  But he completely ignored Brian Kelly. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2611.6s)]
*  Brian Kelly actually went, gave one of these to him. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2613.2s)]
*  He just he didn't have any time for coach. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2615.8799999999997s)]
*  What was your favorite pick in the first 15 rounds? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2618.56s)]
*  Or value slash you think the guy's going to absolutely kick ass for the team? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2622.3999999999996s)]
*  For value slash kick ass for the team. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2627.24s)]
*  I mean, the value picks are pretty obvious here. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2630.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, notice how he's not saying Kelvin Banks to the Saints at nine. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2635.64s)]
*  That didn't jump out of the tongue. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2639.3999999999996s)]
*  I think the entire I think the entire time was surprised that [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  the entire state was surprised that that they that they took a tackle. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2644.0s)]
*  This is not a value pick, but my favorite pick of the entire draft [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2648.04s)]
*  was one that was scripted exactly where it was supposed to go. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2652.7999999999997s)]
*  It was Ashen Gentie to the Raiders because of all of the excellent players [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2655.48s)]
*  that we've talked about all year long. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2661.12s)]
*  He is such a fucking dominant football player. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2663.2799999999997s)]
*  He's such a dominant football player. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2667.8399999999997s)]
*  And he's going to a team that has some pieces [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2670.16s)]
*  where he's going to really be get a chance to produce. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2674.0s)]
*  I think he's going to have like a flat out awesome rookie year. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2676.12s)]
*  I'm excited to use him on Madden, too. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2678.72s)]
*  So what was your favorite value slash? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2681.56s)]
*  I love this fit. I love everything about this pick. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2684.44s)]
*  I love Hampton to the Chargers. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2688.7999999999997s)]
*  What do you think his because what do you what do you think [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2691.3999999999996s)]
*  he's going to go in an auction draft? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2693.68s)]
*  Like, if you were going to lose, all the charges are on the ball. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2695.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's going to be a top guy. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2698.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that said, you know, Gentie is like [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2700.7200000000003s)]
*  physically just a freak and special, but that Hampton's not that far behind him. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2704.0800000000004s)]
*  And I that's like a perfect because because all those charges running backs [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2708.8s)]
*  to you are just like ticking time bombs, like, you know, with all Dobbins is, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2712.88s)]
*  you know, just another injury waiting to happen, unfortunately. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2715.6000000000004s)]
*  And Gus Edwards is like a thousand years old. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2717.8s)]
*  Really seems like it like it just seems like a plug and play guy. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2720.48s)]
*  It's going to be like an all pro potentially, like in a couple of seasons. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2723.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that was one of those. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2726.2400000000002s)]
*  If you took them at 12, it's like, it's high, but that's a nice pick. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2727.4s)]
*  But when you get them at 22, you're like, oh, no brainer. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2731.28s)]
*  I agree with you. That one, the Falcons getting getting Walker. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2735.16s)]
*  And then I really like Golden to the Packers. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2739.48s)]
*  They just over and over again, just keep getting these receivers. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2742.92s)]
*  The Pats haven't haven't been able to draft one in 20 years. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2746.4s)]
*  And the Packers over and over again are just grabbing these dudes. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2749.56s)]
*  But I thought that was a good one. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2753.08s)]
*  The Eagles kind of did it again, too, with Jahad Campbell, right? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2754.52s)]
*  Fans like great pick. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2757.24s)]
*  Yeah, like they just get another SEC stud who somehow falls. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2758.64s)]
*  And there's the injury concern. But man, yeah, yeah. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2762.08s)]
*  It was the he had the injury, but the great pick, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2764.52s)]
*  a terrorizing player when he's healthy, man. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2767.52s)]
*  Good guy. Would you have taken Travis Hunter Abdul Carter [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2770.44s)]
*  if you had the second pick? Travis Hunter. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2773.48s)]
*  OK. Would you have traded all that stuff? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2776.24s)]
*  Jacksonville traded to get him? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2778.0s)]
*  Probably not. But if if if you're there, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2779.68s)]
*  I take him in in front of Carter because to me, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2782.96s)]
*  like if you what's the best case scenario for Carter [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2787.88s)]
*  that he turns into like a Michael Parsons type of player? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2790.52s)]
*  He's not quite as good as Michael Parsons, right? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  Parsons, slightly poor man's Parsons, I think slightly poor man's Parsons. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2796.32s)]
*  Right. Hunter, though, to me, has the opportunity, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2800.08s)]
*  particularly if he just decides on one side of the ball. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2804.84s)]
*  To me, the defensive side of the ball is where I think he needs to be. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2809.76s)]
*  He could be everything. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2813.16s)]
*  He could be the next Dion Sanders, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2815.04s)]
*  Daryl Revis type of player that like locks up a side of the field for a team [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2818.48s)]
*  for X amount of years. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2822.08s)]
*  That was a very fun pick. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2824.04s)]
*  All right. Thanks for staying up with us, man. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2825.16s)]
*  Thanks, Rudy. Always good to see your face as well. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2827.52s)]
*  We're going to take a break. Come back with CR Mahoney. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2830.28s)]
*  All right. We're recording this nine thirty three p.m. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2833.12s)]
*  No Wi-Fi in my house for some reason. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2836.92s)]
*  So I'm using my iPhone. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2839.0s)]
*  I think it looks fine. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2841.32s)]
*  The dream team is here. Rob Mahoney, Chris Ryan. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2842.84s)]
*  Just watch OKC come back from at least 55 points. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2845.36s)]
*  Mahoney, was that the John Morant got injured game or the Alex Crusoe? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2850.1600000000003s)]
*  Not quite the Alex Crusoe game. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2853.7200000000003s)]
*  But if it was a bigger game, it would be the Alex Crusoe game game. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2855.28s)]
*  Why not both? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2858.04s)]
*  But the I think the dark clouds of John Morant [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2859.0s)]
*  falling that hard in the fashion that he did and the way that the game [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2863.0800000000004s)]
*  just completely flipped on its head the moment that he left. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2866.1200000000003s)]
*  It's hard not for that for that not to be the top line takeaway. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2869.48s)]
*  It's just such a bummer. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2872.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's always somebody you worried was going to get injured [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2873.8399999999997s)]
*  in every game because of the way he played. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2876.9599999999996s)]
*  But that was not his fault. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2878.56s)]
*  That was a pretty fluky day. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2879.8399999999997s)]
*  See, I was at 30 to you at all or not really. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2882.9599999999996s)]
*  I actually did do a little bit of research. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2885.24s)]
*  I did some Zapruder on this. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2887.7599999999998s)]
*  It does feel like Dort slipping before he even realizes that that John is there. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2889.24s)]
*  But I'm sure other people have differing opinions. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2893.68s)]
*  Tough, tough week for guys slipping and then undercutting famous stars in the playoffs. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2896.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you want to get it off your chest early or do you want to save it for later? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2901.92s)]
*  Not great. Not great. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2905.08s)]
*  I'll tell you what OKC did show me, though. OK. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2906.88s)]
*  It's never good to lose by 30 when you're you're the favorites to win the title [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2911.12s)]
*  in a game three when it looked like the series was over after the first two games. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2914.92s)]
*  And then Joggetts her momentum shifts, but it was still like a 24 point [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2918.6800000000003s)]
*  game in the third quarter, you know, and then OKC did the thing. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2922.64s)]
*  That, you know, I really appreciate it if you're going to have some [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2927.48s)]
*  championship pedigree. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2930.52s)]
*  Can you really crack down? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2931.96s)]
*  Can you go on a run? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2933.32s)]
*  Can you crack the defense up another level? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2934.4s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, it started to feel like the first two games. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2937.6s)]
*  So, Rob, weirdly, I think that game was like a a a win [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2940.4s)]
*  and something that maybe OKC needed for those last two rounds [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2945.44s)]
*  that they're going to get to would be my takeaway. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2948.8s)]
*  No, I mean, it's certainly a better context than winning by 50 plus. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2950.68s)]
*  Right. Like these are the kinds of these are the kinds of runs [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2954.4s)]
*  you want to have to make. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2956.8s)]
*  I think the Caruso point you laid up top is is really important. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2957.48s)]
*  This idea that he is a crucial part of their closing groups. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2960.48s)]
*  And I think showed in this case, you got to play that dude off the floor [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2963.48s)]
*  because he will fuck you up and he will end your season [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2966.8s)]
*  like the number of just completely disruptive defensive plays [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2969.44s)]
*  he had down the stretch against bigs, against wings, against guards. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2972.2400000000002s)]
*  He just like his defensive range is so incredible. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2976.0s)]
*  And the only thing you can really do is try to challenge him to hit some shots, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2978.72s)]
*  try to try to, you know, spate, I think, push him on the other end [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2982.16s)]
*  to the point that OKC has to make some hard calls. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2985.92s)]
*  And they just never reach that point because Caruso was that good. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2988.44s)]
*  And ultimately, I think because Chet and J. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2991.16s)]
*  Dub were that good, too. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2993.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty rare to go into a closing stretch of a game, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2994.7200000000003s)]
*  especially with a comeback that significant was like, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=2997.92s)]
*  I think they were down twenty nine at the most. Right. Yeah. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3000.2400000000002s)]
*  And then to have the defensive possessions be the thing [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3003.12s)]
*  you're going to walk away remembering. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3006.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not like it's it's not like Corey Brewer and Josh Smith like bombing away. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3008.4s)]
*  It's like, no, Alex Cruz, so literally just like stop the Grizzlies [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3012.68s)]
*  from scoring like 10 times. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3016.08s)]
*  And that swings the game. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  CR is as a scrappy former little basketball player. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3019.2s)]
*  Did you say Kinship watching him take on Jaron Jackson? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3022.8799999999997s)]
*  Is there anything more fun if we were just going to rank things [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3027.56s)]
*  that don't quite get as a guy with a receding hairline? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3030.64s)]
*  Oh, I did. You see that there are many end roads to the metaphor. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3034.52s)]
*  But it's one of those things that's so secretly fun about basketball [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3038.88s)]
*  that we all enjoy, but we don't talk about nearly enough [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3042.6800000000003s)]
*  is when the much smaller guys guarding the bigger guy [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  who's just being completely exposed. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3048.44s)]
*  We're seeing a little bit in the Golden State Houston series, too, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3050.2400000000002s)]
*  with Draymond and Fred Van Blee, where they're just like, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3053.28s)]
*  Fred Van Blee, it's like five eleven. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3055.88s)]
*  We're going to put him on Draymond. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3057.7200000000003s)]
*  What are you guys going to do? And he can't do anything. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3059.0s)]
*  But for Jaron Jackson, who I did not vote for all NBA [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3061.32s)]
*  and I think is a frustrated player to watch sometimes. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3065.64s)]
*  But I did not think that was a good look for him. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3068.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I thought he had that one nice [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3072.52s)]
*  shot that went high off the glass towards the end of the game. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3075.56s)]
*  Like every once in a while, as he pulls something out of his back, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3078.2s)]
*  his handle does not really he doesn't have the handle of somebody [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3080.48s)]
*  that you can trust in a fourth quarter in a big game like that right now. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3084.2799999999997s)]
*  I will say that for Memphis, it's probably incredibly difficult [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3087.6s)]
*  to navigate the jaws here, jaws not here. Yeah. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3091.72s)]
*  Because they feel like such a different roster when he goes out. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3094.32s)]
*  It automatically makes, you know, your canards like that much more important. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3096.96s)]
*  Your contrar is important. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3102.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, whereas those guys should be additive and not essential. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3103.44s)]
*  And so I just I really feel for Memphis, they're probably not. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3106.5600000000004s)]
*  They were probably never going to win this series. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3109.2000000000003s)]
*  And they were probably going to get maybe not swept, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3110.76s)]
*  but it was probably going to be a gentleman sweep. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3113.0400000000004s)]
*  And now it just seems like this might be a franchise altering night for them. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3114.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that was like a best case shooting half from Memphis overall. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3118.0800000000004s)]
*  They were hitting everything. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3121.5600000000004s)]
*  It was just everything was clicking into place, starting with Scottie Pippen [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3122.8s)]
*  Jr. having such an amazing game for them to have to give it all back like this [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3125.52s)]
*  is so dispiriting, is so crushing. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3130.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think the Jaren Jackson piece of this is interesting to talk about [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3132.0s)]
*  because OKC is a horrible matchup for him. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3135.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, I think his handle is good enough to beat Biggs. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3137.1600000000003s)]
*  It's not good enough to beat the Alex Caruso's and certainly to drive [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3140.04s)]
*  into the teeth of a defense like Oklahoma City. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3143.4s)]
*  It's just that's where you really strain even the more developed part [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3145.4s)]
*  of his skill set from this year. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3148.96s)]
*  So it seems like John might be seriously hurt. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3150.72s)]
*  We have no idea as we're taping this, but he came back out and crutches. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3153.2s)]
*  Crutch is never good. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3157.68s)]
*  Maybe it's a hip thing. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3159.04s)]
*  Maybe they think it might be as who knows? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3160.08s)]
*  I don't want to speculate, but honestly, when he took his jersey off, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3162.16s)]
*  coming off the court, he was he was not responding [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3165.2s)]
*  as if he was going to be coming back out there. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3169.0s)]
*  You could see he was in a lot of pain. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3170.8399999999997s)]
*  You could say he was in a lot of anguish over that fall. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3172.6s)]
*  It was it was a tough scene all around. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3174.7999999999997s)]
*  I hated it, man. It was just like it's the the the jaw experience [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3176.7599999999998s)]
*  and such a sick nutshell where he was about to do something incredibly sick. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3180.44s)]
*  And you're like, this is why I watch basketball. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3186.32s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3187.8s)]
*  And then just the freaky fluky stuff. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3188.56s)]
*  But I want I want like guys to try to do stuff like that. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3190.96s)]
*  That's why you watch hoops. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3194.2400000000002s)]
*  The audacity to hurdle the door is what makes job job. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3195.36s)]
*  But it's also what leads to these plays, unfortunately. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3198.84s)]
*  I missed it live. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3200.8s)]
*  So I went back a couple of minutes because when I flipped over, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3201.84s)]
*  I flipped over when I saw Verno tweet like, oh, no. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3204.6s)]
*  And I was like, this could only be one of three or four things. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3207.4s)]
*  So I went back and when I established it wasn't a Cowboys draft pick situation, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3210.1600000000003s)]
*  I was like, oh, let me find when the jaw injury must happen. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3214.88s)]
*  And I went too far back and you can watch him and you can see like all the life [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3217.7200000000003s)]
*  in his eyes and he's just such the heartbeat of the franchise while he's out there. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3221.96s)]
*  And like the crowd is feeding off of him. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3225.52s)]
*  So it was really eerie to go back like even a minute before the injury. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3227.2000000000003s)]
*  And then it all changes. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3231.12s)]
*  You know, when Verno tweets, oh, no, the most likely scenario is a jaw injury. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3233.04s)]
*  Like given that the NFL draft tonight, it was probably like I have over two and a [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3238.48s)]
*  half quarterbacks in the first round. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3243.24s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3245.2s)]
*  There was all kinds of gambling possibilities to this OKC piece. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3246.28s)]
*  You know, there's not a lot to learn from this series. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3251.16s)]
*  It's a I think pretty much of a mismatch. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3253.8s)]
*  And if Memphis was going to win a game, it was going to be tonight. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3256.52s)]
*  But for the most part, this was either going to be four or five. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3258.84s)]
*  But it did get interesting down there. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3261.88s)]
*  Five minutes left. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3264.04s)]
*  Memphis is playing really hard. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3265.76s)]
*  Pippen's doing some interesting stuff against SGA is like a smaller guy [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3267.36s)]
*  trying to like kind of dive down on his dribble. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3271.44s)]
*  And, you know, they're throwing like some flash double teams at them. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3273.76s)]
*  They're bouncing off of them and just trying to watch them execute. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3276.84s)]
*  And the the big guy was was Holmgren. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3281.6400000000003s)]
*  Where you really felt the stretch five this of him, and he was not [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  not shy about taking shots. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3291.6800000000003s)]
*  He made one big one. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3293.32s)]
*  But but I was watching that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3294.28s)]
*  Did you notice anything down the stretch there? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3296.5600000000004s)]
*  Because that's going to happen to them. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3298.2000000000003s)]
*  They're going to play the Clippers probably in in round two. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3300.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. They may play Golden State or the Lakers. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3303.88s)]
*  Who knows in round three? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3306.88s)]
*  And then the Celtics are waiting for them. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3308.44s)]
*  And there's going to be these little pockets at the end of games, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3310.0800000000004s)]
*  these real crunch time moments when teams are going to be throwing [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3313.6800000000003s)]
*  everything they have at them to try to knock them out of their offense. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3317.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like, all right, Jaylen Williams, let's see it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3320.0800000000004s)]
*  Hey, check. Can you make that Alex Cruz? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3321.76s)]
*  Are you afraid of the corner? How about you, Lou Dort? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3324.04s)]
*  What did you notice from the last five minutes? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3326.56s)]
*  I mean, I think just a lot of optimism from the chat piece of this game, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3330.7599999999998s)]
*  just a monster second half overall, that is heartening as far as his piece. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3334.24s)]
*  And that right there always going to have the questions [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3338.12s)]
*  about this sort of secondary offense. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3339.52s)]
*  They're also going to have those questions, as you say, about what [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3341.64s)]
*  what is the best optimal defense to throw at SGA in a playoff setting? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3343.6s)]
*  And I think Scottie Pippen Jr. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3347.7599999999998s)]
*  does a good job against pretty much every star he's asked to guard. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3349.2s)]
*  Like real, real like Yeoman's work, considering like what he's asked to do. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3351.9199999999996s)]
*  You could say the same of a Chris Dunn matchup. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3356.08s)]
*  Derek Jones Jr. is one of the few defenders in the league [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3358.3599999999997s)]
*  who actually seem to have an effect on SGA in the regular season [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3360.68s)]
*  during some of their matchups. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3363.9199999999996s)]
*  And so the challenge of a team like the Clippers, as Denver is finding out, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3364.96s)]
*  is the sheer variety of shit that they can throw at you [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3368.52s)]
*  and the way that they can mix up their coverages and their assignments [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3371.56s)]
*  and keep you guessing at all times. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3374.16s)]
*  And if something is going to throw the thunder off their game [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3375.7599999999998s)]
*  and I'm not sure it will in a way that they're going to lose a series. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3378.56s)]
*  But it would have to be disruptive in that way. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3381.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's really hard. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3384.3199999999997s)]
*  I said this last Thursday. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3385.2799999999997s)]
*  It's hard for me to imagine them not winning the title. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3386.7999999999997s)]
*  I thought that this was like a real like cool gut check win, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3388.7599999999998s)]
*  despite the fact that the headline will be Ja. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3392.3599999999997s)]
*  The chat thing that I noticed down the stretch, Bill with the threes [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3394.64s)]
*  was just like how he rendered Edie kind of unplayable. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3398.08s)]
*  I mean, he was still out there. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3401.52s)]
*  But like watching Edie try to like get out to the perimeter, I was just like. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3402.92s)]
*  I just got to grab it. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3406.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's the perfect OKC box score. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3414.92s)]
*  If you're saying what's the blueprint for what their championship [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3417.8s)]
*  clinching box score would look like, right? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3421.44s)]
*  SGA 31, eight. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3423.88s)]
*  Holmgren 24, eight rebounds. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3426.8s)]
*  Williams 26, six and five. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3429.6400000000003s)]
*  And then Caruso. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3432.96s)]
*  How many steals do they have for 10, six with four with four steals? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3434.84s)]
*  But how many deflections? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3438.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And just and had a couple of those Kawhi Leonard. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3440.04s)]
*  I'm just going to take the ball from you now. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3444.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes. Moments. Yeah. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3446.2000000000003s)]
*  Or is fun. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3447.6800000000003s)]
*  He was am effing the crowd as a defender. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3448.76s)]
*  I've not seen that recently. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3452.0800000000004s)]
*  I remember the first year he started playing for the Lakers. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3454.1600000000003s)]
*  And it became a big thing because his hair was so weird. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3459.1600000000003s)]
*  He hadn't shaved his hair yet. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3461.7200000000003s)]
*  And he just had one of those like super duper, almost like one of those [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3463.12s)]
*  sports writers at a Super Bowl haircuts where you're like, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3466.68s)]
*  what is going on with that guy's head? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3469.8399999999997s)]
*  And it became a huge talking point on social media where they were like, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3473.2s)]
*  look at this fucking guy, this white guy, the Lakers have. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3477.88s)]
*  Yeah, what's going on with this dude? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3480.68s)]
*  And he had a couple. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3482.68s)]
*  I remember LeBron broke some sort of record and Caruso was one of the first [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3483.64s)]
*  people that high fived them. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3487.6s)]
*  And it was like, wow, so awkward. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3488.88s)]
*  This Caruso guy. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3490.56s)]
*  And then we all kind of realized watching them. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3491.8s)]
*  Hey, this guy's pretty good. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3495.6000000000004s)]
*  Am I crazy or is Caruso like decent? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3497.4s)]
*  And then it just kind of kept going. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3500.0s)]
*  He's a decently big part of that 2020 title team and it's gone and gone. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3501.5200000000004s)]
*  And now I find it hard to believe Rob that he's not a crunch time guy for them. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3506.84s)]
*  Right. He's just going to probably be out there in big games. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3512.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3515.32s)]
*  Yeah. It's going to, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3516.2400000000002s)]
*  it is going to come down to whether you can push him and push them in that way [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3517.2000000000003s)]
*  where he has to be more of an offensive presence. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3520.32s)]
*  If you can leverage it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3522.32s)]
*  But he's such a good playmaker in a facilitating capacity. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3523.2000000000003s)]
*  And he's such a smart cutter. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3526.36s)]
*  I feel like he always has stuff he can do. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3527.96s)]
*  And of course, if you're creating enough havoc on defense to create fast breaks, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3529.92s)]
*  you're going to win those tradeoffs. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3533.6400000000003s)]
*  The issue with Caruso is honestly not even really been his offense. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3535.88s)]
*  Historically, it's been like, can he be healthy enough to play a lot [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3538.7200000000003s)]
*  over the course of entire seasons? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3542.32s)]
*  And with the way everything is shortened up now, it really doesn't matter. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3543.96s)]
*  You can just put him out there for 25 to 30 minutes a night. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3546.88s)]
*  If the matchup allows it and he's going to do you a lot of good. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3549.48s)]
*  Well, we thought we were going to be leading this podcast with Clippers [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3552.8s)]
*  nuggets. I talked about this on a pot earlier this week when I went, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3556.68s)]
*  I had Zach on and we talked about Kawhi for a while. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3562.44s)]
*  And then at the end, we're talking about this series. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3564.64s)]
*  And I felt deep in my gut that there was a chance the nuggets [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3567.04s)]
*  might really go sideways. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3570.44s)]
*  Like, I bet the Clippers tonight. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3572.04s)]
*  I, I just, I don't know if the nuggets. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3573.6s)]
*  Think they're good. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3578.04s)]
*  I mean, the nuggets, I don't know if they believe in whatever they're doing. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3579.84s)]
*  And you can kind of feel it. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3584.44s)]
*  That game got away from them fast. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3585.52s)]
*  The Clippers made a bunch of threes. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3587.0s)]
*  I thought Yokeage was spectacular in the first quarter. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3588.72s)]
*  It was, it felt like he was on pace for 30 assists, but defensively, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3591.2799999999997s)]
*  they're just really limited. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3596.12s)]
*  They're benched today. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3597.2799999999997s)]
*  At one point, I don't know what they finished with at one point. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3599.04s)]
*  Russ was out, right? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3602.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3603.84s)]
*  It was the second half. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3604.12s)]
*  A foot injury apparently going on. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3604.84s)]
*  They finished with six points from the bench. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3606.72s)]
*  You're not going to win a playoff game. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3609.4s)]
*  Not ideal. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3610.72s)]
*  And they were down 20 points for basically two hours. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3611.36s)]
*  And now weird schedule, Clark, this is the clerk. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3615.2s)]
*  This doesn't usually happen in the first round, but they're playing [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3618.92s)]
*  again, 3 PM PT on Saturday. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3621.4s)]
*  So it's 40 hours after this game ended. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3624.32s)]
*  And that is a five and a half playable guys right now. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3632.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3632.96s)]
*  Payne Watson's been like kind of a disaster in some of his minutes so far. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3633.2s)]
*  If Russ can't play, like, this is the thing about all of the hand [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3637.52s)]
*  ringing about the highs and lows of Russell Westbrook. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3641.32s)]
*  Like they just straight up need his minutes more than anything. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3643.32s)]
*  Like they can't afford this much Julian Strother is they're going to have to [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3645.8s)]
*  throw out there if Russ can't go. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3649.44s)]
*  And overall, the construction of the team is just, it's just, it's just [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3651.44s)]
*  And overall, the construction of the team to your point, Bill does not feel like [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3655.72s)]
*  one that would give you a lot of confidence if you're Nicole Jokic, if [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3660.48s)]
*  you're Jamal Murray, if you're Aaron Gordon with one functional calf, like, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know how you watch the team around you not close out to shooter [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3667.32s)]
*  after shooter after shooter and think, Oh, we're, we're just a couple of, of [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3671.04s)]
*  effort plays away or we're a couple of strategic tweaks away. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3674.7999999999997s)]
*  This, this feels like a chasm in the series that's developing. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3678.44s)]
*  Uh, I think in part, cause the nuggets, they just look shook by the end [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3681.6s)]
*  of this game. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3685.32s)]
*  They look like a team that fired their coach in GM a week before the season [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3686.1200000000003s)]
*  ended. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3688.88s)]
*  Sure do. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3689.0s)]
*  You know, like, Oh shit, I forgot they did that. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3689.48s)]
*  And there's three guys on the team who have been the sort of core of this, of [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3691.7200000000003s)]
*  this like run. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3697.56s)]
*  And it just feels like the end of a cycle and these guys are looking around for [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3698.48s)]
*  reinforcements and the only place they can look is to Westbrook who's bounced [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3701.92s)]
*  around the NBA for a couple of seasons now. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3705.6400000000003s)]
*  And the bridge to nowhere, like, like the young kids that they were supposed to [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3708.48s)]
*  develop just are obviously not ready or capable and Porter on any given night, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3713.04s)]
*  you're like, are you on planet earth or not, man? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3717.56s)]
*  So it's just, it just feels like it's just not a good recipe for after watching [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3719.8s)]
*  these three games, I'm surprised they won one. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3725.0s)]
*  That's what I'll say. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3727.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3728.0s)]
*  Chris, do you think they should have hired Vincent Hannah as their interim [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3728.2799999999997s)]
*  coach? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3731.16s)]
*  Just, I mean, Adelman is like doing his best, I guess. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3735.84s)]
*  I don't even know what you would do with a week's prep to become the head coach [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3738.64s)]
*  of a championship hopeful. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3742.16s)]
*  But I think if we were wondering whether or not Cronkite was like Josh, he was [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3744.44s)]
*  like, oh, I think we actually have the pedigree to win the title. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3747.3999999999996s)]
*  We just need different voices in the room versus I want to get this stuff at these [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3750.44s)]
*  guys out of here so we can get ready for the draft and the offseason now. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3754.3599999999997s)]
*  I think it might be the latter. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3758.08s)]
*  I mean, even Westbrook saying my foot's hurt is like, you fucking get hurt. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3760.0s)]
*  What can you do? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3764.24s)]
*  Be there. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3766.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3767.28s)]
*  Do you just have me here to do heat? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3770.44s)]
*  Don't you want my basketball inside? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3772.4s)]
*  Just pull the string on his back. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3773.88s)]
*  Well, I feel bad for poor Adelman. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3776.0800000000004s)]
*  I just think at this point they might've been better off just hiring actors to [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3778.0800000000004s)]
*  play the coach, just bring somebody in. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3781.6000000000004s)]
*  Bring in Ben Affleck and just tell him to be the way back guy. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3783.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3786.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3787.76s)]
*  Just to tell him to look like he had a few the night before and he's just going [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3788.1200000000003s)]
*  to yell at the refs and stuff. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3791.36s)]
*  I have to ask the king of narratives, Chris Ryan. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3794.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3797.52s)]
*  If the nuggets lose badly again, Saturday, I think, and combined with OKC [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3799.36s)]
*  sweeping Memphis, the narratives are going to come shooting left and right [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3805.8s)]
*  like a t-shirt gun, one of which will be you voted for Jokic for MVP and he just, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3809.96s)]
*  uh, he just lost in five. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3815.28s)]
*  Who is he? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3817.28s)]
*  Shouldn't have won game one. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3817.5600000000004s)]
*  Who is you? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3819.28s)]
*  Well, we're trying to figure out who did this. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3820.6000000000004s)]
*  Me and Rousselo and probably about 20 other people I think voted for Jokic. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3822.36s)]
*  And, and me to be fair. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3826.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3828.7200000000003s)]
*  How do you guys feel about that? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3828.96s)]
*  I feel fine. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3830.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel like it's a regular season award and I will sleep soundly at [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3830.92s)]
*  night with that knowledge. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3833.6800000000003s)]
*  I actually feel better about it because Denver has been so exposed in this [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3835.0800000000004s)]
*  series that it kind of, it kind of cements why I voted for him in the first place. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3838.96s)]
*  I couldn't believe how mediocre his team was. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3843.6000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3845.7200000000003s)]
*  I really feel like, yeah, just going forward. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3846.44s)]
*  Uh, now, so what else do we have for king of narratives? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3850.84s)]
*  Uh, CR for this one. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3854.0s)]
*  Um, just how taxing title runs are. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3855.72s)]
*  I mean, even I think your beloved Celtics are experiencing this a little bit [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3858.44s)]
*  physically, uh, obviously that has something to do with the sort of the elbows [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3861.72s)]
*  and the dives going on in that series, but it's amazing to watch, uh, just even [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3865.68s)]
*  Jokic and how like the tank is kind of like, I mean, it's not empty, but it is [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3871.16s)]
*  certainly half full and maybe has like a little bit of like accidental diesel in [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3875.7999999999997s)]
*  there at this point. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3879.3199999999997s)]
*  And maybe he's looking around and he's saying, I don't have any help, but how do [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3880.56s)]
*  you rebuild this team? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3883.64s)]
*  If you're, I mean, you, I'm asking you, cause I'm like, what are, what are there [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3884.68s)]
*  moves here? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3888.92s)]
*  What are their options? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3889.72s)]
*  Is there like, is you have to take two steps back to take a step forward? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3890.7599999999998s)]
*  I hate to like be writing their obituary already, but he's too amazing. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3894.64s)]
*  It's tough to do the down two one. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3899.4s)]
*  What are they doing this off season? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3901.52s)]
*  But it was hard not to think of that during the entire game. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3902.92s)]
*  One win in overtime and didn't really look that in it tonight. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3905.08s)]
*  Game two was a little closer, but like, I just feel like the clip [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3911.0s)]
*  is. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3913.56s)]
*  Are attacking them from all over the court, like Rob said earlier. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3914.84s)]
*  So the narrative here is like, man, like winning a title and being competitive [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3917.7999999999997s)]
*  over the course of a three year stretch will really take a lot about a franchise. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3923.08s)]
*  Well, Rob, you're looking at a Michael Porter, my problem for your problem trade, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3926.88s)]
*  right? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  That's probably where it starts. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3932.08s)]
*  Do you have somebody you're not happy with? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3934.4s)]
*  Cause we have Michael Porter Jr. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3936.08s)]
*  What about a swap a roo? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3937.64s)]
*  I would say that would be the first thing they try to do. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3939.08s)]
*  Or to get two functional rotation players for Michael Porter Jr. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3941.8s)]
*  Right? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3945.8s)]
*  Like the Denver does need depth in such a bad way. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3945.96s)]
*  They do need shooting. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3948.36s)]
*  They need the stuff that at his best MPJ is able to provide right now. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3949.2400000000002s)]
*  He's clearly not at his best. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3953.48s)]
*  Maybe he's not at his best consistently enough for, you know, the salary slot he [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3954.6800000000003s)]
*  takes and the role you're asking him to fill on the team. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3958.84s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3961.32s)]
*  Their problems cut so much deeper. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3961.88s)]
*  Like they're just not going to go on any long runs if this is how they're going to [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3963.32s)]
*  defend. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3967.24s)]
*  And functionally, the core of the team is not going to get dramatically better in [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3967.7999999999997s)]
*  that regard unless you start making some pretty dramatic moves. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3971.72s)]
*  And it's so hard, right? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3974.6s)]
*  Cause if you look back in retrospect, it's like we've talked, I think everybody's [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3975.56s)]
*  talked about this on their pods and stuff, but like KCP obviously would have been a [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3979.7999999999997s)]
*  valuable person for this team to have within the logic of the team's construction. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3984.3599999999997s)]
*  It would have worked, but it's not like KCP set the world on fire as a member of the [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3988.04s)]
*  magic. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3991.64s)]
*  So it's like, I can see why they were like, we need to get off these guys. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3992.04s)]
*  We can't pay like guys a little bit out of their prime for past performance. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3995.56s)]
*  I understand all that, but Jesus, when you're watching what they put out there, it's [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=3999.56s)]
*  like, it's unbelievable that they want a title a couple of years ago. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4003.7999999999997s)]
*  It was incredible to bill. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4006.36s)]
*  You're saying Yoke is passing in the first quarter really was awesome, like high level [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4007.48s)]
*  Yoke stuff, what you would expect from a player of his pedigree. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4012.6s)]
*  You see, you watch them go on a run. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4015.96s)]
*  You're seeing him set up these guys with all these no look passes. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4017.48s)]
*  You're like, okay, Denver's really got something. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4019.72s)]
*  You look at the scoreboard. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4021.88s)]
*  They are up four points. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4022.92s)]
*  I just think the Clippers have done such an amazing job of just chipping away at all [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4024.12s)]
*  of these nuggets runs. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4028.6s)]
*  It's a lot of those James Harden in particular, who played amazing basketball today. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4029.56s)]
*  Kawhi Leonard wasn't even that good and it just did not matter as far as like the Clippers [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4034.2s)]
*  consistency of scoring went. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4038.2s)]
*  So they've just been able to mitigate every little bit of something that the nuggets have [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4039.72s)]
*  put together. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4044.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's, it's when you're in that position for Denver, it just takes all of the wind [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4044.92s)]
*  out of you. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4049.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4050.28s)]
*  When you have, you basically have five and a half, six guys and Russ is one of the six [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4050.52s)]
*  and he's not even playing. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4054.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4055.72s)]
*  The flip side, the flip side with the Clippers is like, they can beat you with just their [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4056.6s)]
*  two best guys or they can beat you from the margins with Powell. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4060.44s)]
*  And like if Pattoons going to hit four threes. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4064.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4066.2s)]
*  Backbreaking. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4066.92s)]
*  I don't know what the magic Nick Pattoon three number is for a victory, but it looked a lot [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4067.16s)]
*  like tonight. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4072.52s)]
*  Well, this is what I've been saying all year and I don't, I get it. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4073.88s)]
*  America's probably not focused on the Clippers home regular season games, but they have a [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4078.12s)]
*  legitimately good home court advantage now. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4082.3599999999997s)]
*  And you could feel it in that first half when they hit a couple threes, the crowd was [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4084.8399999999997s)]
*  delirious. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4089.0s)]
*  So, you know, they got hot when a team's going to make that many threes at home. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4089.72s)]
*  They're probably learning a playoff game. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4092.6s)]
*  But man, when Kawhi is as good as he's been, you know, he was 21 and 11, six assists today. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4094.68s)]
*  And Harden was probably their best player in the game, but Kawhi was still seemingly [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4101.4s)]
*  Kawhi and just seems so athletic. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4106.44s)]
*  He had that one play in the first half when he went coast to coast on a steel, did those [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4108.36s)]
*  two long Kawhi steps with the Oakage next to him and got it in there. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4112.44s)]
*  And I just think the Clippers are really good. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4116.599999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to keep saying it. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4118.44s)]
*  I think people will have to take them seriously as a contender. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4119.5599999999995s)]
*  I think with the Nuggets, you know, Doc was when Doc was doing my pod, when Doc did my [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4123.96s)]
*  pod after Denver won, he was talking about how much he loves Porter and how just how [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4130.76s)]
*  happy he was for that guy and how people don't realize how big he is and he can rebound. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4136.4400000000005s)]
*  I remember raving about it. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4140.92s)]
*  I remember filing it away. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4142.12s)]
*  Like, I wonder if Doc ever runs a team, would Porter be somebody he targets? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4143.400000000001s)]
*  And then you're thinking about Milwaukee in this other series. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4147.320000000001s)]
*  And that's another team that's going to be, we're stuck. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4151.16s)]
*  What do we do? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4154.12s)]
*  I feel like Rob, we're at peak. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4155.16s)]
*  We have an awesome player, but we're stuck. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4157.88s)]
*  What do we do? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4159.88s)]
*  I feel like we've hit the peak in recent NBA history. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4160.84s)]
*  You look around these teams like we have Giannis and we have no chance. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4164.040000000001s)]
*  We have Jokic and there's no way we're winning three straight rounds with the team we have. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4168.84s)]
*  I don't remember teams with players this good just really not being in the mix. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4173.0s)]
*  And I think it speaks to how deep the league is now. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4180.76s)]
*  It's how deep the league is. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4183.0s)]
*  It's also some of these teams, especially in more of the mid and small markets, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4184.68s)]
*  running scared of what the apron is going to mean for them and preemptively trying to get ahead of [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4188.52s)]
*  some of these problems in the way that Chris was talking about. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4192.84s)]
*  It wouldn't have fully saved the nuggets. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4195.96s)]
*  And there's some parallel versions of that for the Bucks where if anything, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4198.120000000001s)]
*  maybe they've been a little too aggressive in steering into the skid of their finances. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4201.56s)]
*  Maybe they've been too aggressive in steering into the skid, certainly of the age curve, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4205.0s)]
*  of leaning on someone like Dame Lillard to be Giannis' primary running mate. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4208.92s)]
*  You couldn't have anticipated the blood clot, but you could have anticipated some of the gradual [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4213.320000000001s)]
*  decline year over year that a small guard is going to have naturally. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4217.48s)]
*  And so then you end up with Giannis under Takumbo, you end up with Nikola Jokic, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4221.16s)]
*  surrounded by teams that are fine, pretty good. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4224.839999999999s)]
*  And because they are so amazing, will at some points trick you into thinking that [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4228.12s)]
*  they're probably a little bit better than they are. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4232.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's a really dangerous place to be at a team. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4234.5199999999995s)]
*  It's hard to take an honest assessment of who your sixth and seventh and eighth guys are [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4237.0s)]
*  when every time they're shooting an open three from Giannis or they're getting a backdoor cut [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4241.24s)]
*  from Jokic. It's hard to take stock of your team in those circumstances. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4245.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it seems like the theme of all of these teams seems to be [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4249.0s)]
*  losing out on their core role players or veterans that are looking for a new contract. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4255.32s)]
*  They miss those guys, whether it's the Warriors, the Bucks, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4260.68s)]
*  whether it's Denver, and then they wind up regretting it because it's so impossible to [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4264.2s)]
*  find that exact guy, the exact KCP, the exact name warrior role player. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4269.4s)]
*  I mean, I guess Iggy Bunsypote retired. I mean, it's the person that holds everything [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4275.4s)]
*  together and does all this little stuff. And I just, I don't even, as a, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4279.24s)]
*  somebody who cheers for somebody who's not contending, I can't even imagine how difficult [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4284.04s)]
*  it must be. Who's your team? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4287.16s)]
*  I forgot. You weren't cheering for Toby tonight? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4290.04s)]
*  I'm cheering for basketball. I'm cheering for the Pistons. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4292.28s)]
*  B-ball Paul? Yeah. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4295.4s)]
*  Toby was 0-4-6 and then Nick Scandrade and CR was like, burn in hell! [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4297.4800000000005s)]
*  He's having a good series. I hope you go 0-4-20! [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4303.08s)]
*  He's been good. Speaking of him, Ben Simmons had a couple moments in the Clips game too. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4305.0s)]
*  Ben Simmons plus nine. Broke out a headband, made a stop on somebody and did a little like [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4310.280000000001s)]
*  stare to the crowd, kind of yell to the crowd stuff, continuing his streak of dribbling hard [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4317.0s)]
*  right to the logo and then skidding to a stop and handing the ball off to a guard. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4322.68s)]
*  I have a suggestion for you for the last act of your career. You've done a lot with your [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4327.0s)]
*  career, but I want you to lose all your hair, then grow out a crazy sports writer receding hairline [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4331.08s)]
*  and become the poet of the Intuit Dome and just write about Ben Simmons' connection to the wall. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4336.92s)]
*  This was the day Ben Simmons became a Clipper. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4344.52s)]
*  That would be, what if we started just assigning pieces like that and telling people to just sell [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4347.8s)]
*  the hell out of them? Like somebody goes in and writes like a really heartfelt, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4352.44s)]
*  Ben Simmons has finally found a home here. Today he exploded for zero points and three rebounds, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4356.5199999999995s)]
*  but his defensive stop in the first half really made it. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4363.4s)]
*  Derek Jones and Batum coming off the bench is a hundred times better than anything Denver has. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4369.08s)]
*  They have seven guys plus the Simmons thing. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4373.24s)]
*  You joke about the Simmons part. The Clippers winning his minutes so decisively is a damning [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4377.4s)]
*  a piece of evidence. That is really where you are if you're the Denver Nuggets. You're straight up [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4383.879999999999s)]
*  getting embarrassed by the Ben Simmons zone defense minutes. Jokic is on the floor for a lot [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4389.0s)]
*  of those, and you're still trying to figure it out. You could see them trying to cut behind it, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4393.96s)]
*  trying to work some angles. None of it felt sustainable. None of it felt like they ever [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4398.2s)]
*  got into an actual rhythm. Breaking down, I repeat, a Ben Simmons zone defense. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4402.6s)]
*  That's the series right there. I do not see a path for them. I'm going to game four. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4409.88s)]
*  I think the only way they win, well two things. One, the Clippers could just have a game where [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4417.72s)]
*  they go like six for 45 from three. It's 3 PM. Yeah. I mean anybody can just suck in a game and [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4421.96s)]
*  not make any threes. If you don't make any threes, you could lose to anybody. The only other guy I [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4429.56s)]
*  can see is Murray. They need a 38 point Murray game, but when you watch how the Clippers, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4434.76s)]
*  all these guys, they can throw at him. I think it's a tall ass. They just have too many dudes. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4440.92s)]
*  I thought Russel and I said on Sunday that the Nuggets were up one nothing, and both of us were [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4447.56s)]
*  like, haven't changed my opinion at all. I still feel exactly the same, and I think it's going to [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4453.160000000001s)]
*  be really hard for Nuggets to win. Now I don't think they can win. Let's take a break and talk [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4457.64s)]
*  about the ballast at the palace. Part two, Nick's Pistons. You're listening to the Bill Simmons [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4462.12s)]

*  Kerr game, which is what, uh, he gave me this theory years ago and I was monitoring it. The young [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4513.16s)]
*  were so psyched to be in the playoffs again, playoff team hosting the game three and the [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4520.12s)]
*  energies through the roof. Yeah. And everybody's like, Oh my God, they're going to go ape shit in [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4524.5199999999995s)]
*  this game. The crowd's going to be amazing. And then they come out and they lay an egg. They did [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4529.8s)]
*  not lay an egg. The Knicks were really good. And I think that the thing that jumps out to me, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4533.48s)]
*  CR, the shot distribution, which was a big topic the last couple of days, because you have all [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4539.24s)]
*  of these really good offensive players and you have Jalen Brunson in game two shooting 27 times [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4546.44s)]
*  and taking 12 free throws. I went on terminating Eddie's show yesterday and we were talking about [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4551.8s)]
*  Hey Brunson, you had 37. That's not necessarily a good thing for your team. If towns looks like he [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4559.32s)]
*  wants to go listen to Morrissey after the game and, and, uh, you know, OG and Noby has 10 points, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4565.320000000001s)]
*  like maybe get maybe a little more distribution. And it's basically the Isaiah Thomas mid eighties [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4572.92s)]
*  Pistons rule of, yeah, I could have scored 35, but I scored 23 and three other guys on my team had an [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4577.96s)]
*  awesome game. So the shot distribution this time, 20 Brunson, 18 towns, 17 and an OB 13 bridges, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4585.64s)]
*  all four guys had 20 points and up. And that to me feels like the balance. So my question, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4593.400000000001s)]
*  you see our intentional or unintentional. I think it was probably intentional. I don't think you can [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4598.04s)]
*  have a roster so overly committed to this starting five in this core and just be like, but it's still [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4605.400000000001s)]
*  a one man show and you guys just stand in the corners. And also, I mean like Brunson missing [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4610.68s)]
*  time over the course of the season. I think it tellingly when he missed some time in this last [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4615.320000000001s)]
*  bit of the regular season, that's when bridges kind of blossomed a little bit. I mean, I know [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4620.28s)]
*  that Nick's fans have a love hate relationship with him, but he needed to be a little bit more [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4623.96s)]
*  featured and a little bit more set up to be, to be a feature player. I, uh, I gotta admit, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4628.759999999999s)]
*  can we talk a little bit about the Brunson experience? Yeah, let's go. I'm so excited to [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4634.679999999999s)]
*  do so. Don't dislike Jalen Brunson. Yeah. You are coming to this with trauma. I will say given [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4639.5599999999995s)]
*  last year's playoffs, if I was a Pistons fan, I would hate Jalen Brunson. Yeah. And, uh, I want [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4646.68s)]
*  to like him. Uh, it's hard right now. I'm not enjoying this. Are you guys enjoying this? How [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4652.92s)]
*  much of this has to do with the Nick Sixer series last year? Almost torpedoing your friendship with [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4659.400000000001s)]
*  fantasy. We're fine. We're good. Patched it up. 26%. Okay. What's your take Rob on Jalen Brunson? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4664.6s)]
*  Um, but one of the league's most unlikely underdog stories ever then begin now, now getting the [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4675.72s)]
*  backlash. I'm becoming a little radicalized. I gotta say I have a quite high tolerance for [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4682.2s)]
*  James Harden esk theatrics. I'm mostly fine with it. He makes Harden look like Bronco Nagurski. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4690.52s)]
*  This is the thing. And I think, I think the juxtaposition of him specifically against [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4696.2s)]
*  the Sardar Thompson in the series, who's just playing good, wholesome defense, but with a [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4700.68s)]
*  hyper athletic frame. And you're just seeing him get baited into sometimes dumb young player shit [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4704.4400000000005s)]
*  and sometimes inexplicable non-calls that Jalen Brunson gets the benefit of. I will say, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4710.52s)]
*  I thought the first half in this game, he, Jalen Brunson was participating in every version of [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4715.320000000001s)]
*  that possible and trying to sell every one of these calls. I thought he cleaned it up a lot in [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4720.120000000001s)]
*  the second half. And I thought that some of what we were talking about in terms of the shot [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4724.360000000001s)]
*  distribution paid off too. Like he just looked really fresh and was such a huge part of them [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4727.48s)]
*  rebuffing all of these Pistons runs in part because he wasn't trying to sell all these dumb [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4731.48s)]
*  fouls every single possession and hitting the floor every single time. At some point you can, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4735.16s)]
*  you are allowed to just play basketball. And I like when Jalen Brunson just plays basketball. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4740.36s)]
*  I like when he draws some fouls too, but we need a little bit of shame, just a modicum of shame. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4744.839999999999s)]
*  The Pistons fans were trying to, trying to show him some shame. They were chanting FJLM Brunson [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4750.919999999999s)]
*  and it wasn't really, it obviously kind of fired him up a little bit. He closed really well. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4756.36s)]
*  I think it's probably his size throws me off a lot because he goes in there like a bowling, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4761.08s)]
*  like a pinball really. And he just starts flying around the lane. The head snap thing is like [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4765.32s)]
*  jarring, I think is to watch visually. I think it's the stuff on the perimeter that bothers me [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4770.679999999999s)]
*  the most, the diving in, like, you know, diving into guys when there's like there, he's being [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4776.759999999999s)]
*  defended outside the three point line and just shoulder dropping, going into them or, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4782.04s)]
*  you know, flopping down after he's coming down from a shot because he thinks somebody's in his [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4786.68s)]
*  landing zone. But yeah, I think that, go ahead. Well, I went to a Celtics Knicks game, like maybe [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4791.08s)]
*  January or February, I can't remember, and was talking about how I just, I hadn't realized that [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4798.76s)]
*  he'd become the best, you know, floper extraordinaire in the entire league. And, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4804.84s)]
*  and a lot of the Knicks fans got mad about it. They're like, fuck you. How dare you? He's [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4810.76s)]
*  worse than James Harden. It's like, yeah, cause it's not just him like driving to the basket and [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4816.12s)]
*  flailing to get a call. It's all the stuff he's doing off the ball. It's when somebody sets him [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4821.16s)]
*  a pick and it's just a lot of him throwing his arms up in the air, but it's gamesmanship and it [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4825.72s)]
*  works because it gets the crowd fired up, especially in a playoff series. I thought [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4831.64s)]
*  the crowd was awesome. And there was this great moment, the first of many altercations in this [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4837.400000000001s)]
*  game when it got heated and you could hear the crowd, the decibels of the crowd, everyone was [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4841.72s)]
*  so excited. There might be a fight. It was like, I was trying to think, is there an arena that is [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4849.240000000001s)]
*  more ready to see a battle on the court than Detroit? Ironically, they had the biggest one of [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4854.4400000000005s)]
*  the century, but they were just like, let's fucking go. Let's drop the gloves. They thought [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4859.48s)]
*  it was like a Red Brings game. We're not allowed to fight in basketball. When Townes got into it [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4864.2s)]
*  with who's the Pistone got into it with? I thought it was Paul Reed. It was Paul Reed. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4870.44s)]
*  And then they panned to Isaiah Stewart on the bench and he's wearing like a full suit and he's [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4875.48s)]
*  just like, shit, I wish I was out there. Isaiah Stewart's like, I should have just worn my jersey [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4881.719999999999s)]
*  because then I could have gone on the court at least. The funniest part about this game to be [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4887.88s)]
*  was that there were more dads in the crowd than like a California youth soccer match. It was like [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4892.4400000000005s)]
*  Bridges was fighting with Tim Hardaway Sr. Rick Brunson was fighting with Cade Cunningham and [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4897.72s)]
*  with Jalen Rose. I was just like, this is an amazing testament to like, to like what's going [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4903.96s)]
*  on with the amount of kids in the NBA. So if I'm the, if I'm Detroit, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4909.88s)]
*  I thought the Knicks were going to win this in four or five. If I'm Detroit, I feel like I'm in the [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4918.28s)]
*  vicinity of this series. It's the opposite of the Denver game. Even if you look at the box score, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4923.16s)]
*  they got a really good Hardaway game. They got a solid Cunningham game, typical for him, some [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4928.52s)]
*  turnovers. They had a really good Schroeder game. And I continue to wonder why Miami didn't want [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4934.28s)]
*  Schroeder. I'm just going to ask that in every podcast. Miami's like, we're good. Now they don't [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4939.4s)]
*  have Terry Roger. They don't really have a point card, but Tobias was the one he'd five points, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4943.799999999999s)]
*  two for nine. He was the one that had bad one. They're in these games. I think all of these games [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4949.719999999999s)]
*  are going to be close. I don't see a blowout either way. I like the matchup of the two, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4955.4s)]
*  but it feels like Detroit's, what do you think Rob, like two hairs below, three hairs below. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4961.719999999999s)]
*  They are close, but I came away from this game, which is a two point game, feeling pretty confident [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4968.36s)]
*  about the Knicks margin for error, because everything you laid out is true. Like those [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4974.28s)]
*  are all elements of the game. Some went well for Detroit, some didn't. They kind of all [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4977.879999999999s)]
*  came out in the wash for them. For the Knicks part of it, I thought the Knicks just really botched [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4981.32s)]
*  their pick and roll defense for a huge portion of this game. Just were not on the same page at all. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4985.48s)]
*  They got nothing from their bench through the entirety of this game. They got out shot from [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4990.36s)]
*  three. They got out offensive rebounded and they still win squeaking it out. But down the stretch, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=4994.12s)]
*  it really did feel like I trust Jalen Brunson to make these plays. I trust even like Carl [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5000.2s)]
*  Anthony Towns to make these plays who he had a tremendous game overall. And to the idea of [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5004.84s)]
*  whether the shot distribution was intentional or not. Kat coming out super aggro. You can usually [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5008.92s)]
*  tell really quickly kind of what's in his head. He kind of has it all out on his sleeve and his [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5014.68s)]
*  intention to make his presence felt on this game, I think changed a lot of it early. And that then [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5018.92s)]
*  opened up for Jalen Brunson to do a lot of the closing late. Clutch player of the year, Jalen [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5024.2s)]
*  Brunson. Oh yeah. I forgot. A real award that exists. I did not vote for him. You know, I voted [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5027.8s)]
*  for Jokic because he's the best offensive player of the week. That's the ball of the time. I did see [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5033.56s)]
*  we discussed previously, Bill, that you had Jason Tatum third on your ballot for Clutch player of [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5039.08s)]
*  the year. Yeah, he's been a bunch of late game shots. You didn't like that pick? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5043.48s)]
*  I'm not 19. He's only 19. I'm not disputing it. I'm just saying I saw the full voting and there was [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5048.599999999999s)]
*  exactly one third place vote for Jason Tatum for Clutch player of the year. So congratulations. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5054.2s)]
*  Really? That's funny. You're looking your way into voting history. The Boston fans are mad [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5058.44s)]
*  because I didn't vote for Pritchard for six man of the year. So I don't know. Am I a homer? Am I an [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5062.839999999999s)]
*  anti-homer? I don't know. I'm all over the map. The Schroeder PCR. When can this guy just find a [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5067.4s)]
*  home? I love having him in playoff series. Is he just like, he's like automatic QB and Thanksgiving. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5077.799999999999s)]
*  He's just going to bounce around every playoff. He's like Woody Guthrie riding the rails. Yeah, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5083.16s)]
*  you know, he's just a vagabond of the NBA. I mean, I think that the problem for the Pistons is that [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5087.639999999999s)]
*  they're relying on Schroeder, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Beasley. Although Beasley had an awesome season. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5092.84s)]
*  Those guys can't be your second options, third options. You know, like the kid needs one more [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5099.56s)]
*  guy. I think they're hoping or hope to. It was Jaden Ivy. I love Jaden Ivy, even though he hasn't [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5104.04s)]
*  quite realized his potential tough injury. I have to ask you guys, when you watch the- [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5109.72s)]
*  Durant? Oh, I thought you were going Durant right there. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5113.56s)]
*  Oh no. Don't do that. Don't do that. Why not? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5116.4400000000005s)]
*  Come on, man. Why couldn't we go Durant? Why not? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5120.04s)]
*  Yeah. I wanted to know whether or not when you watch the Knicks, Rob, does this look like a team [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5122.68s)]
*  that can go very far with this style of basketball? And with this, like this just feels very much like [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5129.400000000001s)]
*  we have now pushed this to the limit of what this team can do under Tibbs and with this [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5136.280000000001s)]
*  roster construction. That's what it looks like. The Tibbs part is the key part. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5140.52s)]
*  Is that the roster is the roster plus Tibbs, Rob. Yeah. Well, even what we were talking about as [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5145.08s)]
*  far as Jalen Brunson overextending in the previous games, some of that is a Tibbs style of offense [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5149.56s)]
*  as well. Some of it is Jalen Brunson. Some of it is a guy like Kat, who can sort of ebb and flow [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5155.320000000001s)]
*  in these games. It doesn't always like claim his spot as far as his role in the offense goes, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5159.320000000001s)]
*  if he's not really focusing and thinking about it. I think Tibbs is such a weird coach because he [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5163.320000000001s)]
*  cleans up so many things for you, but he also so clearly leaves all of this other low-hanging fruit [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5168.76s)]
*  that some other coach could come in and do and make your team a little bit better in these [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5174.84s)]
*  particular ways. For example, I'm just like, I remain stunned by how little one, five pick and [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5179.4800000000005s)]
*  roll the Knicks run. Like Jalen Brunson and Carl Towns are your best players. It almost doesn't [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5185.64s)]
*  matter who is guarding them. You can do that anytime you want. And certainly every second [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5190.52s)]
*  that Jalen Duren is guarding Carl Towns, which was a lot of the second half after the, you know, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5195.0s)]
*  the Pistons kind of switched that match up. Why are you not running pick and roll at Jalen Duren [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5199.08s)]
*  every second he's on the court? Also, why aren't you doing it with Bridges and Towns? Like it [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5203.96s)]
*  doesn't just have to be Brunson. Bridges is good at that too. Lots of options. I respect Tibbs a [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5207.879999999999s)]
*  lot. I think he brings a lot to this team, but there is something to the idea of the formula [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5214.2s)]
*  maxing out at a certain point. CR, who is, when Towns does the thing where he intentionally starts [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5218.839999999999s)]
*  some sort of altercation and then does the evil laughing thing, is that Garcia in internal affairs? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5225.719999999999s)]
*  What movie character is that for you? Cobra Kai person? Who is that? What movie villain? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5231.56s)]
*  It's just more like it is the guy who it's like the guy in Trainspotting who thrones the [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5238.04s)]
*  pint glass over his shoulder and doesn't see where it's going. Like he's not quite beg B, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5242.360000000001s)]
*  but he has like a little bit of like who started the fight. Yeah, this is weird. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5247.0s)]
*  I do enjoy it. I don't know if he's ever actually been in an NBA fight, but he's always like getting [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5251.8s)]
*  around it in the mix of some of these. It's pretty funny. I thought Bebopal was trying to get ejected. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5256.76s)]
*  What was that? But he was pissed. I mean, do you think? I think the thing is that Brunson's, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5262.2s)]
*  whether or not you like watching it, it clearly works because it drives other players nuts. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5268.12s)]
*  Completely. And I don't really have the rule book in front of me to judge whether or not that was [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5273.5599999999995s)]
*  a backcourt violation in the last second there, but he was doing a lot of stuff to just get Dern. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5280.2s)]
*  Dern was going nuts after for a while there. Yeah. Yeah. I've liked Dern in this series. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5286.2s)]
*  He had towns. It was the full towns experience. I thought he had a really good game, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5290.76s)]
*  but then of course he couldn't resist having the terrible foul at the worst possible time. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5294.84s)]
*  Yeah. Like two minutes left. He's like, don't forget. I have to. It's almost like when, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5298.679999999999s)]
*  when my dog jumps in this little fountain thing we have every once in a while, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5304.44s)]
*  he gets super excited and he jumps in and then he looks at us like, I had to guys. I'm sorry. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5307.96s)]
*  I just, it was sitting there. It was cold. I had to do it. Towns has to like, he just can't help [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5313.0s)]
*  it. He has to have the one foul in the last three minutes and he has to almost get it out of his [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5318.68s)]
*  system. I think the series goes six. Six. So you think Detroit gets one more here? Yeah. I think [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5323.56s)]
*  I'm going to lose. One of my bets was Nixon four or five. And I think, uh, I think the trick gets [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5330.12s)]
*  one more, right? They, they get a game where they shoot really well. Um, towns gets into foul trouble. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5336.44s)]
*  We haven't had a foul trouble game. That's the other thing with these game fours, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5341.72s)]
*  the league can get a little, uh, creative with some of this stuff. Uh, Lakers wolves game three. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5345.8s)]
*  CR, can I have your animosity rankings for round one? Um, certainly Luca and Rudy are, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5353.8s)]
*  are pretty high up there. I was trying to, I was asking a couple of people last day. I was like, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5360.6s)]
*  what is the Rudy original sin against Luca? And I guess he did punch him in the stomach or hit [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5365.4800000000005s)]
*  him in the stomach like a long time ago. Yeah. But, uh, I always laugh. I was at the game, game one, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5370.44s)]
*  he's shit talking Rudy the entire game, like with like true hatred in his eyes and nobody from the [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5377.0s)]
*  team will stand up for Rudy. It is one of those things where it's just like, you know what, man, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5384.839999999999s)]
*  go ahead. You know, if you want to waste energy telling this guy to go fuck himself, that's fine. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5389.08s)]
*  So I would definitely put Luca and Rudy up there pretty high team wise. Um, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5393.5599999999995s)]
*  wait, can I have a couple other candidates for the place? I think Dame Halliburton has to be, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5399.160000000001s)]
*  I was going to say just straight up is straight up team versus team. Yeah. I would go, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5405.0s)]
*  I would go Dame Halliburton, but also team versus team. And then, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5411.56s)]
*  you know, it's bad when they just cut to James Johnson randomly when he's not even really playing [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5416.040000000001s)]
*  like he's over there just lurking in the fucking maniac James Johnson. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5421.4800000000005s)]
*  He'll kill you. Um, yeah. Bucks Pacers is way up there. I think Celts magic is starting to, uh, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5428.6s)]
*  like they've made Al Horford mad, which is impossible. Yeah. KCP versus Al Horford. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5435.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They made Al Horford mad. Yeah. Which happens like three times a year. I was kind of [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5441.080000000001s)]
*  shocked by that. Um, I dunno, one of the most popular nights of Celtics, probably the most [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5446.4400000000005s)]
*  popular Celtics teammate of the last 15 years. And he was ready to hit KCP with a two by four. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5451.320000000001s)]
*  His sister's going at magic fans on Twitter. Pretty amazing stuff. What about Draymond with [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5458.52s)]
*  each and every rocket? Yeah. Like it's completely separate arguments and frustrations with all of [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5464.280000000001s)]
*  them somehow. And I appreciate his ability to compartmentalize personally. Well, don't you feel [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5469.88s)]
*  like that has a chance to go up a notch because the way they're guarding him with Van Vliet. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5474.68s)]
*  Well, Van Vliet, we haven't really seen him have a moment with Dylan Brooks yet. There's going to be [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5481.96s)]
*  no Butler in game three. So Draymond is going to be in that mode. Like I've got to do more. Um, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5487.08s)]
*  yeah, that's a good one. Oh yeah. I think Bucks Pacers is the most inexplicable one though. I [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5492.2s)]
*  don't, it's just a bunch of nice guys on both teams and yet they hate each other and it feels [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5497.24s)]
*  like it's going to be the anchorman brawl every time, every time it gets heated. Um, I'm trying [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5501.48s)]
*  to think of anything else. Maybe some Lou Dort Memphis game four. I mean, yeah, they were getting [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5507.08s)]
*  in his ass a little bit and I saw Draymond like put up an Instagram story that was like, that's a [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5511.72s)]
*  dirty play. But I think when you go back and watch it, it's really hard to see Dort like, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5516.52s)]
*  oh, I'm going to tackle job midair here. You know, he's like slipping as Pippen turns around. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5522.120000000001s)]
*  Well, I told you, I would challenge any human being. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5527.56s)]
*  Good. Oh, go ahead, Rob. I would challenge any human being to try to move fast enough [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5531.160000000001s)]
*  while rotating their body to beat John Morant to a quick twitch spot in order to even try to undercut [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5535.400000000001s)]
*  it. Like it's just not a realistic human thing to do even for Lou Dort. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5541.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, I told Sarudy and Kevin Clark that I had worked up a proper amount of hatred by like [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5545.5599999999995s)]
*  basically the halftime of game two for the magic and for KCP. And they said, don't worry. We also [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5552.04s)]
*  hate KCP because he's been, I think he was like one for a hundred at that point in the series. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5558.2s)]
*  That's the funniest thing is you getting really cranky because you're worried one of the Sauntyx [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5563.16s)]
*  is going to get, you know, mortally injured. They hurt Tatum and it's a contact sport. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5566.76s)]
*  Bill, poor Zingas got split open. Like it was a fucking steel cage match against Roman Reigns. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5573.8s)]
*  Well, they tagged in Gogo Patazzi. That's what happens after he comes into the game. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5581.08s)]
*  Yeah. My dad was so upset. He sent me some of the funniest texts, uh, just about Patazzi. He was [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5584.92s)]
*  like, who is this guy? He just comes in and fouls people. I don't think he's been logging a lot of [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5590.92s)]
*  Orlando magic. It would be funny if after the Pacers get eliminated, you give James Johnson [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5596.92s)]
*  your dad's tickets so that it just pans up to James Johnson. Anytime a self-explorer gets [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5601.16s)]
*  targeted. Well, I mean, we always talk about movie coolers, right? Like, like Swayze and Roadhouse [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5606.4400000000005s)]
*  was the best one ever. And then we've seen people try to rip off that gimmick over and over again in [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5611.64s)]
*  movies. James Johnson's the real life cooler. It seems like, well, he's the same at this point. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5615.8s)]
*  He's aged out of Swayze. Yeah. But he's still wearing a uniform, right? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5620.52s)]
*  I guess. Or did he become an assistant coach and do it that way? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5624.04s)]
*  It's practically what Rick Brunson did tonight. That's true. Yeah. So tomorrow we have Boston, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5630.28s)]
*  Orlando, Indiana, Milwaukee, Lakers, Minnesota. Um, which one are you more excited about out of [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5635.64s)]
*  those three CR? Me? Lakers, Minnesota. That's been one of my favorite series so far. Okay. Same for [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5643.56s)]
*  your rep. Yeah. I don't like, I would like to think that Pacers bucks is going to be fun and [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5648.2s)]
*  competitive and maybe have a spin on that series. I just don't really see what levers the bucks can [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5652.92s)]
*  pull to really change things there. They kind of are what they are and Yannis is going to be [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5658.4400000000005s)]
*  amazing, but how do they really make anything happen versus we clearly know how the wolves make [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5662.28s)]
*  things happen and it's hit a fuck ton of threes, make really sharp decisions with the ball and [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5667.0s)]
*  counteract at least some of what the Lakers have going on on the other end. Yeah. So I, when I was [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5672.6s)]
*  talking to Eddie in Termini yesterday, Eddie was thinking thought Yannis and Milwaukee can come back [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5678.36s)]
*  and they're going to win the next two and this is going to be a long series. And I just don't see it. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5684.04s)]
*  I just think Indiana is just significantly better than them. And the way that Milwaukee wins game [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5689.24s)]
*  three, Yannis has a big game, but you could almost spot him the big game. And I still think Indiana [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5696.28s)]
*  wins, but the game that's looming that hasn't happened yet is the Indiana fucks up the game [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5700.679999999999s)]
*  in the last four minutes game. We have not had that yet. This is combined with, well combined with [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5706.6s)]
*  you know, Milwaukee home for game three, the refs. That's, that's a game where you're probably going [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5712.84s)]
*  to get some calls and I could just see this one being like, man, I can't believe we're not up three [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5718.120000000001s)]
*  Oh right now. How did we lose that? It feels like it could be one of those. It's possible. They're not [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5723.96s)]
*  that bad in crunch time for the record. They know I just, I think they're, I don't trust that average. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5729.400000000001s)]
*  Well, so game two, what are they up 17? And then all of a sudden it's a two point game. Like they [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5735.0s)]
*  just have a lot of those. Yeah. Yeah. Where it's just like, how did you let this team back in there? [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5740.2s)]
*  Lakers, Minnesota, what I'm watching for after going to game two is just, is Edwards going to get [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5745.48s)]
*  involved earlier than he did. There was some interesting go bear. It didn't feel this way at [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5751.56s)]
*  the game, but there was some interesting go bear actually defending one-on-one against LeBron, Luca [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5758.44s)]
*  and I think it was LeBron, maybe it was LeBron and Luca, but they were like basically four and 13 [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5764.28s)]
*  when four for 13, when they went at them Reeves had, I think a little more success. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5769.8s)]
*  I felt like Minnesota did not ever want that to happen and they were in complete panic every time [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5774.12s)]
*  go bear was, you know, in isolation with those guys, but I, I'm going to be interested to see if [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5780.44s)]
*  they just keep doing that or if there's an extra wrinkle. I didn't like what I saw from Connelly [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5786.759999999999s)]
*  at all in game two. So what is that? Just hard for him to play two games in three days. What do [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5790.92s)]
*  we have with that? There was some interesting Shannon minutes in that game that I wonder like, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5795.72s)]
*  yeah, could he swing it from an energy standpoint? I still, Rob, I just still feel like the Lakers are [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5800.36s)]
*  really limited, man. That's like a team. That's a team that has five and a half guys. They've no [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5807.24s)]
*  rim protection at all. And they're just putting this incredible burden burden on LeBron and Rui [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5811.56s)]
*  to basically protect the rim and rebound that I don't know if sustainable, but wait, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5817.48s)]
*  are you seeing anything else? I mean, their defense was pretty incredible with that group, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5822.12s)]
*  but yeah, the more times you have to do that repetitively and the more times you're doing [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5826.12s)]
*  it and giving Anna a chance to look at it and see how to break it down. And they're going to film [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5829.719999999999s)]
*  sessions in between is going to get harder and harder. And there's no alternative, right? There's [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5833.24s)]
*  not the option to just play Jackson Hayes 35 minutes. You can't do it. So all they have to do [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5837.24s)]
*  is stretch out Dorian and Rui and LeBron as much as you possibly can. And I thought LeBron was [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5842.919999999999s)]
*  awesome on defense in particular in that game. He was great. Ultimately, the Lakers, I mean, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5847.0s)]
*  they didn't light the world on fire with their own scoring. They won that game because they locked [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5851.64s)]
*  the Wolves up and they forced a team that's a little shaky in its decision making to make some [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5855.96s)]
*  characteristically Wolves mistakes. Bill, did you notice it was the loading up on Ant? Because he [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5860.44s)]
*  said after the game that it felt like a zone and that he has to go watch the tape. But in game one, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5866.04s)]
*  they were loading up on Ant and I didn't necessarily think it was zone, but they were [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5870.6s)]
*  definitely cheating onto him. And he was there. I thought they were moving the ball really well [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5874.2s)]
*  in game one. The Wolves were obviously they had threes coming out of like their ears that game, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5879.0s)]
*  but it didn't feel significantly different on TV watching it. Like, so I was kind of surprised [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5884.599999999999s)]
*  that Ant was like, well, that was a new wrinkle. I hadn't seen that yet. Yeah. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5889.32s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see it at all. And I thought he was just too tentative. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5892.599999999999s)]
*  And I talked to somebody involved with the team at halftime and I was like, what's up with Ant? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5895.8s)]
*  Said his shoulders bother him and seemed like he was tentative. So I think he had, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5901.4s)]
*  because he was swinging a lot. Like he was, he was kind of like moving his arm around. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5904.599999999999s)]
*  There was one time he came to the table to go back in the game and he had one of those giant [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5907.96s)]
*  Norma tech kind of straight jacket things on. And it almost seemed like demonstrative, like [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5912.759999999999s)]
*  my shoulder hurts. Look, I'm wearing this giant contraption. It was just weird. I thought it was [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5919.879999999999s)]
*  a weird game for him, but I don't see him doing that in Minnesota. I could see him coming back [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5923.719999999999s)]
*  hard. So if you, is there any O and two team you think could come back Rob? I don't think so. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5929.48s)]
*  Okay. Is there, is there any, yeah, I don't think the heater coming back. Like, I mean, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5935.5599999999995s)]
*  who else would we be talking about? But the heat is very promising is Rozier. Is he just like, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5940.12s)]
*  we're never going to see him again. Like what's what's, what was Rozier's injury? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5948.44s)]
*  I mean, he's out for the year, right? Even if you had him, would you play him over Davion Mitchell, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5953.16s)]
*  who's I think is just a better player at this point than Rozier is? I like, this feels like [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5958.44s)]
*  it should be a bigger story. This whole Rozier thing, like how I don't have to talk about some [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5963.5599999999995s)]
*  of the stuff he was involved with, but this guy went from, they traded a first round pick. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5968.44s)]
*  He was averaging 25 a game on Charlotte to now he's, he just has disappeared and nobody even [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5972.599999999999s)]
*  talks about him during the games. It's just, I mean, I think he's in a, I think he's in a, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5978.04s)]
*  he's still pretty injured. I think he might be out for at least a round or two, but [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5982.599999999999s)]
*  meanwhile home prices on the Davion peninsula are just, they're shooting up, man. I mean, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5988.04s)]
*  it's a really competitive market. So Rudy told me two nights ago that if Orlando paid a hundred [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=5994.04s)]
*  million dollars a summer for Ty Jerome, he wouldn't blink. That was what he said. He said, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6001.64s)]
*  if it got that high, fine. At least we got our guy. Kind of how I felt about Milton Williams, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6008.36s)]
*  Patriots CR. It's like 26 a year, whatever. We needed a nose tackle. But Ty Jerome, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6014.04s)]
*  and Suggs. Rudy's already moved mentally to the Ty Jerome Suggs era for the magic. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6020.36s)]
*  Honestly, pretty sick. You drafted a guy with dinosaur arms. Are you excited? Little T-Rex arms. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6024.68s)]
*  You know, I've heard, I've heard the jokes and, you know, he's, we root for underdogs in New England [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6031.0s)]
*  and Boston. Yeah. Classic. You want to get an underdog. Yeah. I just want to know how an inch [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6038.28s)]
*  became so important for the left tackle. So 33 inch arms, he's fine, but 32 and three eighths, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6043.8s)]
*  he's not fine. We'll find out. That's how we're going to go. I remember a guy, when a guy named [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6049.8s)]
*  Jaylen Brunson dropped to the second round because it wasn't tall enough. If you remember that one. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6054.2s)]
*  All right. Any last things here? What's the thing you're most excited about this weekend, Rob? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6058.76s)]
*  I'm trying to think of like, which of these series can get, I feel a little disoriented because the [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6064.360000000001s)]
*  series that we were loving are now also stilted. If Jimmy Butler doesn't play, if the Clippers keep [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6067.88s)]
*  really accelerating into the series, is there anything else in this first round that we're [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6073.719999999999s)]
*  really psyched about other than, I, we've already talked about a little bit, but I do want to see [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6078.2s)]
*  the Wolves counterpunch. I do want to see what they've got. I think that's probably the most [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6082.599999999999s)]
*  interesting next step for me. Yeah. I thought like, I agree with Rob. Like I think Wolves Lakers is [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6086.04s)]
*  the best remaining series and the one that I feel like has the most chapters. I don't know how many [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6092.44s)]
*  games it's going to go, but after game one, I was like, Holy shit, these guys have more athleticism [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6097.0s)]
*  than the Lakers. Like this is crazy. And now I'm a little bit more measured about it. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6102.76s)]
*  I would not count out Milwaukee in game three. No, I don't think they're very good. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6107.4800000000005s)]
*  New York to tray feels like it might have some legs. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6113.0s)]
*  For some tests. Orlando do pull in a rock fight routine against Boston, maybe stealing a game, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6116.84s)]
*  but yeah, this we might be the Clippers. Denver seems like it might headed to head, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6122.92s)]
*  be headed to being a bust. So we're gonna flip it. After a week, what's the team you're most [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6128.599999999999s)]
*  impressed by? It's gotta be the Clippers. I think, right? Yeah. I think the Clippers, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6133.48s)]
*  because they should probably be up three, nothing. Thunder were impressive tonight. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6138.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, the thing is they were already so impressive. Yeah. You know, the Clippers, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6141.8s)]
*  we wanted to see how they stacked up against the team like Denver so much. And they've had all the [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6145.24s)]
*  answers, right? The fact that they're dictating all the terms of the series so far is really [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6149.639999999999s)]
*  demonstrative at this stage in the playoffs. I would say out of the eight series, the only [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6153.88s)]
*  one I don't have a handle on and part of it is the Butler injury, but just the matchup is just, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6158.12s)]
*  I don't think either team is happy with how they're playing the Golden State Houston. It's just, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6163.64s)]
*  it's a weird one. I don't like Houston's offense. I don't like anything Golden State's doing. If [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6168.2s)]
*  Butler's not out there, I just don't think, I don't think they're good enough. And a lot of it seems [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6172.76s)]
*  to hinge on how each game is being officiated, which I never really like. And then the Rockets [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6179.96s)]
*  just have these wild cards where it's like, all right, Jalen Green made a couple threes. So is [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6186.12s)]
*  he good now? Cause I think he could go one for 11 tomorrow night. You know, I don't trust basically [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6189.72s)]
*  anyone on their team. And then what they're getting away with defending Curry, not to be a [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6194.76s)]
*  Curry defender, but the league's in a weird space right now because they've been really good about, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6200.76s)]
*  you know, letting defenders be able to, letting defenders be able to, uh, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6207.72s)]
*  basically contact, make contact when somebody's driving in the basket or whatever. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6213.88s)]
*  I don't think they've done a good job of cleaning up the stuff way off the ball and some of the [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6218.6s)]
*  holds and just, and conversely, I don't think they've done a good job with the moving screens [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6223.0s)]
*  either, but it just seems like all the stuff off the ball is worse than ever. And then the, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6228.360000000001s)]
*  the physicality of guys going to the basket has actually been handled really well, but I just [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6232.6s)]
*  think the Rockets are getting away with crazy shitting and Steph. I don't like it. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6237.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, I don't know that I've seen a minute go by in the series where someone's arm isn't around [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6240.52s)]
*  Steph's hip, just like locked in, holding him in place as he tries to cut around the court. It's [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6244.52s)]
*  just, he's always had some of that where defenders are allowed to get away with things with Steph [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6249.0s)]
*  that they wouldn't be in any other context, or if he had the ball in his hands, as they're saying, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6253.72s)]
*  it would be officiated completely differently. Uh, somehow he still busts loose as long as they have [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6257.320000000001s)]
*  enough bodies to make their lineups work. And without Jimmy Butler, if that's going to be more [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6262.12s)]
*  than game three, I just don't think they have the bodies to make the lineups work. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6266.04s)]
*  You'll be happy to know that, uh, folks on warriors Twitter are doing collages of Eme [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6270.5199999999995s)]
*  Uduka coach teams diving at other guys' legs and making dirty plays. So there are, there are [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6275.24s)]
*  watchers on the wall, making sure our refs are accountable. Very healthy place. I'll say to the [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6279.72s)]
*  Pistons mix game today, it was refreshing to see the game end and both teams are just furious with [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6285.8s)]
*  the officiating, right? The backcourt violation for Brunson, as you said, Chris was cited chapter [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6291.0s)]
*  and verse. Well, what about the rebound where no time went off the clock and then the guy ran the [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6295.48s)]
*  baseline on the next to the next bench inbound in the ball, which I haven't seen in 20 years. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6299.8s)]
*  Just something for everybody to be pissed about. It really warms the heart. All right. Well, Rob, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6305.32s)]
*  I know you're going to be excited. What, what do you have for TV this weekend? Other than the [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6309.88s)]
*  basketball, we've got the last of us going on. We've got your friends and neighbors going on. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6314.2s)]
*  There's some pretty solid TV happening right now. Yeah. CRG have you still [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6317.88s)]
*  stole from your neighbors at all or you haven't crossed that line yet? No, I have a Birkin guy. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6322.28s)]
*  I'm worried a little bit about some of their security systems that they got here. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6329.0s)]
*  No cameras in any of these houses in your friends and neighbors. Nobody has any, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6332.4400000000005s)]
*  no one. He's got a device that turns off the wifi. We've got to address this pretty soon. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6336.2s)]
*  Hmm. All right. Thanks guys. Thanks for staying up with me. You got it though. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtk8oS6QHA&t=6340.76s)]
