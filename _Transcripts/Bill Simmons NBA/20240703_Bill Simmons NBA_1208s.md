# NBA Tiers Plus the Celtics Get Apron’ed  | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk)
*  I talked about on Sunday's podcast with Wilds, the concept of tiers and trying to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=0.0s)]
*  figure out self-evaluation style, where you are if you're one of the NBA teams, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=6.16s)]
*  like say the Warriors, because I was saying how I thought the Warriors were [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=10.24s)]
*  the 19th team if they didn't get Paul George, which is where they landed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=14.24s)]
*  And at that point, if you're closer to the bottom than you are to the top, what do you do? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=18.64s)]
*  So I blew out those tiers a little bit more. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=23.2s)]
*  The contenders are the same, Boston, OKC, Denver, Minnesota, New York, Dallas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=25.84s)]
*  That next tier I think is three teams, the party crashers, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Cleveland. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=30.48s)]
*  Probably in that order, you could make cases for all of them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=36.08s)]
*  Philadelphia, a bunch of new guys thrown together. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=38.72s)]
*  Injury history of Embiid and Paul George. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=41.84s)]
*  Still not sure if Paul George as the third option of a team is something that he's going to be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=44.32s)]
*  super happy with. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=48.8s)]
*  Milwaukee just has not gotten better this summer, and I don't know what they were doing with their [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=50.0s)]
*  draft. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=54.0s)]
*  Free agency, they seem like they basically punted on except for Dillon Wright. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=54.8s)]
*  And it feels like there's still a trade coming with them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=59.36s)]
*  Cleveland was able to resign Donovan Mitchell, which I did not think was going to happen. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  I'll take the loss. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=67.2s)]
*  I do think one thing that changed was he felt like, you know, New York was looming, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=68.72s)]
*  That was where his head was at. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=75.36s)]
*  He grew up in Connecticut. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=76.64s)]
*  I think he was thinking Knicks or Nets down the road, and everyone in the league felt that way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=78.0s)]
*  My job on this podcast is to pass along the things that I hear and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=82.56s)]
*  make some educated guesses on stuff. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=86.96s)]
*  But what changed? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=88.56s)]
*  The Knicks went in on Ananobe. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=90.0s)]
*  They went on McHale Bridges. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=92.24s)]
*  They did not need Donovan Mitchell anymore. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=94.08s)]
*  Jalen Brunson, I have him ranked as the sixth best player in the league. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=95.68s)]
*  Mitchell didn't make sense for the Knicks anymore. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=99.04s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=101.04s)]
*  Didn't make sense for the Nets either because the Nets got their picks back and they're blowing it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=101.76s)]
*  up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=105.84s)]
*  He didn't really have anywhere to go. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=106.4s)]
*  So if you're Mitchell, do you take the max at Cleveland, ride it out with a team that was good [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=108.08s)]
*  enough to be around to a team that has a lot of talent? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=113.44s)]
*  Do you hope like Miami trades for you? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=116.08s)]
*  But if Miami is trading for you, the stuff they're trading back, now it's just you and Bam out of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=118.0s)]
*  bio. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=122.72s)]
*  Like you're in a worse situation basketball wise than you were before you did the extension. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=123.2s)]
*  He's better off in Cleveland. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  See what happens this year. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=130.88s)]
*  See if Moby gets better. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=132.56s)]
*  See if Kenny Atkinson can improve stuff and then evaluate in a year. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=133.76s)]
*  But as you know, with this stuff, just because you signed an extension doesn't mean you're there [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=137.92s)]
*  for life. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=141.2s)]
*  Still a big win for Cleveland because that felt like this summer he was going to push to one of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=141.68s)]
*  the New York teams didn't happen. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=146.08s)]
*  Next here, illusion of contention, Phoenix, Indiana, Orlando, the Pelicans, the Lakers and Miami. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=148.24s)]
*  If you're in that group, it's just not realistic that you're going to be in the top six unless [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=156.96s)]
*  something transformative happens. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=162.16s)]
*  Like if you're Orlando, Palo jumps up a level. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  If you're the Lakers, you somehow stumble into DeMar DeRozan by some miracle and even that might [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=167.52s)]
*  not be enough. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=172.56s)]
*  The next tier is illusion of hope. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=174.72s)]
*  This is where your feel good story or you have a feel good past and maybe that's enough for this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=177.44s)]
*  year. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=185.44s)]
*  You have some assets you could throw together, but really it's not about 2025. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  That's Memphis, Houston, Sacramento, Golden State and the Coopers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=190.0s)]
*  Then there's a who are we? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=194.08s)]
*  Then there's a who are we tier San Antonio, Toronto, Atlanta. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=196.32s)]
*  I have no idea what those teams want to be this season and I'm not sure they're positive, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=199.52s)]
*  but they are either. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=203.6s)]
*  And then the last tier, which is the real reason I wanted to break this down, the tank teams, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=205.04s)]
*  who are going to be the tanking teams in 2025? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=210.88s)]
*  We know Brooklyn for sure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=213.36s)]
*  We know Washington, Detroit's too young to do anything but tank Charlotte, probably Portland, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=214.56s)]
*  Chicago seems like it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=222.16s)]
*  Especially if DeRozan leaves and then Utah as the wild card. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=224.0s)]
*  And I bring up Utah because the most interesting remaining question for me, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=229.28s)]
*  where does the Lord marketing go and why are they so anxious to trade him? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=234.48s)]
*  Because he's 27 years old. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=238.16s)]
*  He only makes 18 million this year. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=239.68s)]
*  He's a free agent next year. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=241.04s)]
*  They have the calf space. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=242.08s)]
*  They have a bunch of picks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=243.04s)]
*  He's somebody that you would think would be a building block on a possible title contender. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=244.56s)]
*  And yet he's been super available. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=250.24s)]
*  And at some point when there's enough smoke and you hear like, oh, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=252.4s)]
*  teams feel like they can get him or, you know, they'd be open to trading him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=255.36s)]
*  Then I'm going to just start to believe that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=259.2s)]
*  And having had Danny Angel run the Celtics for a long time, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=261.04s)]
*  he's probably looking at marketing and going, well, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=265.68s)]
*  if this guy is the best guy on your team, you're 500 or under. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=268.24s)]
*  If you're, if he's the second best guy on your team and now I have to pay him 50 million a year, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=272.24s)]
*  he's not as good as some of the other second best guys. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=277.2s)]
*  And maybe what's the point in keeping them? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=279.68s)]
*  They have all these picks. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=281.68s)]
*  Maybe we just get more picks and we just have more swings at trying to get, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=283.44s)]
*  you know, Cooper flag in 2025, AJ in 2026. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=289.68s)]
*  I think that's probably how he's thinking because he had it happen with Tatum and he [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=295.76s)]
*  had it happen with Jaylen Brown of he knows the difference between having a lot of picks [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=299.44s)]
*  and actually getting somebody who's a transformative guy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=304.72s)]
*  That's the only reason I could think why they would trade him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=308.0s)]
*  Here's, here's the question on marketing for me. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=312.64s)]
*  The suitors are probably Golden State in Sacramento and San Antonio, if they got kind of crazy, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=317.36s)]
*  but I would say from a necessity standpoint, Golden State and Sacramento are the two teams [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=325.76s)]
*  and Golden State needs them the most because this is probably their last chance to save the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=330.64s)]
*  Steph air and actually maintain some level of competitiveness. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  Could they pull something off with their expirings? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=340.0s)]
*  Could they pull something off with just picks and swaps? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=342.88s)]
*  Like they can give up, you know, a slew of picks and a slew of swaps. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=345.68s)]
*  I think they could trade three first and either three or four swaps and just go all in. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=351.04s)]
*  And that's how you salvage the end of the career. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=356.48s)]
*  I personally wouldn't do that because I think even if you get marketing, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  you're still pretty far away. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  But you leverage the Curry piece in the guilt over, we don't want Curry to become 2014 to 2016 [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=362.96s)]
*  Kobe. Let's move in now. And marketing is, you know, he's a real dude, man. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=370.32s)]
*  He averaged last two years, 25 and eight. He's almost a 50, 40, 90 guy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=375.2s)]
*  I thought he was really good at the end of games. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  Like you can go to him last two minutes and he can produce. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=382.0s)]
*  And if they can somehow keep coming, get marketing, have Steph, obviously have Dream, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  and figure out a way, you know, it's a little complicated because they're an apron team, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=391.28s)]
*  but could Wiggins be in the deal? Could Wiggins go to Toronto and they get Bruce Brown back [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=397.84s)]
*  for Wiggins to save some money. And then they send expirings to Utah and they get more stuff. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=402.96s)]
*  And then they just give all the picks and clean themselves out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=406.88s)]
*  Like it's not, it's not nothing. If they could figure out how to have Curry and marketing [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  Dreemond and Kaminga as like their four, you can probably build around that in some way and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=415.44s)]
*  talk yourself into contending. The reality is Curry is the sixth or seventh best player in the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=422.08s)]
*  league and it's tough to just kick that aside. The other move is you, you trade Dreemond, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  you try to dump Wiggins. Like you really got this and you try to use this as a gap year, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=433.84s)]
*  but as Wilds and I discussed on Sunday, it's a tough one. It's tough when you have a guy who [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  has won you four titles and is one of the 12 best players of all time and wants to win. So [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=443.92s)]
*  that's what makes me think they're probably the lower team. The Kings could also get in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  pretty hard, you know, whether Keegan Murray is in that trade or not, I don't know, but again, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=454.24s)]
*  marketing and salary being so low, they basically just be Kevin Herter or Harrison Barnes and then [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=458.48s)]
*  just all their picks as many picks and swaps as possible. And if you're Utah, you want as many [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=463.44s)]
*  picks and swaps as possible because that appears to be their game plan. And then San Antonio [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=469.12s)]
*  would be the other one because they could offer Zach Collins or Devontae Graham and a bunch of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=475.04s)]
*  picks. They could end up potentially if they really wanted to go nuts, try to get DeRozan too [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=481.36s)]
*  and end up with Wemby, Markkinen, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Castle, Devin Vassel, Sohan, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=489.76s)]
*  Ty Jones, Trey Jones, Ty Jones, geez I'm old, Trey Jones and Kelden Johnson. But, you know, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  you could do a sign and trade with DeRozan. The Spurs could say, fuck it. Let's, we have Wemby. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=508.4s)]
*  There's no way we're going to be a bottom five team with Wemby anyway. We have a bunch of picks [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=512.72s)]
*  from other teams. Let's just try to be good. They have so many picks that they could probably put [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=516.96s)]
*  together the best package for Markkinen. I like the combo him Wemby. I don't know. I would think [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=523.28s)]
*  about it if I was a Spurs. As you know, I'm on the record. I don't like being in the middle, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  but if you have Wemby and the history of having like these transformative guys, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=533.76s)]
*  as it always happens much faster than you think it happened with Luca, happened with LeBron, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=538.88s)]
*  it just, you're speeding up the timetable for when you're going to be relevant. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=543.6s)]
*  And maybe it's time if they feel like they have all these excess picks, grab Markkinen, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=548.48s)]
*  now you can pay them, maybe do a descending extension where it's the most money the first [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=553.12s)]
*  year and starts coming down. You got to think about it. And then that's really it. I can't [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=557.6s)]
*  really think of another team that makes sense for him. So the only other thing was Dallas. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  There was talk about how they got better. They turned Derek Jones, Tim Hardaway and Josh Green [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=572.48s)]
*  into Najee Marshall, Najee Marshall, Klay Thompson and Quentin Grimes. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=577.44s)]
*  Whether they got better depends on how much you think Klay Thompson has left in the tank. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=582.24s)]
*  I know we talked about that on Sunday. Could he be 2013 Ray Allen? I thought defensively, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  he really slipped the last couple of years. It's unclear if he feels like he's ready to be 2013 [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  Ray Allen yet. He's going to be standing in the corner a lot on this team. And you think how many [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=599.36s)]
*  times the Warriors are trying to get him involved coming off picks or coming off a little pin downs [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=604.64s)]
*  or popping up. Dallas has Kyrie and they have Luca and they don't have a lot of room to run offense [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=609.12s)]
*  for anyone else. And I know they had to do it 50 million for three years makes sense, but [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=614.88s)]
*  I'm just not positive how huge of an upgrade it's going to be. And Najee Marshall, who I actually [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=622.0s)]
*  really liked, Derek Jones, maybe that's sideways. I thought Josh Green gave them some athleticism [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=626.4s)]
*  in some of those playoff games last year. I'm just not sure Dallas got much better, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=632.4s)]
*  maybe slightly better. And all that hinges on Klay, who is, you know, he's pretty old. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=639.12s)]
*  And I thought was pretty erratic as a basketball player on and off the court the last couple of [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=645.68s)]
*  years. I thought he was clearly struggling with what his place in the NBA hierarchy was. So we'll [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=650.72s)]
*  see. You're betting on change of scenery, revenge Klay. I get all the reasons and I'm actually [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=655.52s)]
*  rooting for it to work because I love Klay Thompson, but I absolutely 100% didn't think [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=662.0s)]
*  he made sense for the Lakers because his defenses slipped. And how many times can we say this about [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=668.32s)]
*  the Lakers? Like they keep trying to add offense and they keep trying to add points and almost like [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=674.8s)]
*  they're putting together a fantasy team and forgetting in 2020 the team that won the title, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=681.28s)]
*  they had Caruso, they had KCP, Dwight Howard, Danny Green, Rondo. This wasn't a team that was [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=686.64s)]
*  put together like a fantasy team. That team could actually defend. So if you're going out and your [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  answer when you already have LeBron who's 40 and Austin Reeves and Rui who's has trouble against [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=697.76s)]
*  certain matchups, how is Klay Thompson going to help on that front? Is he going to be your lockdown [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=703.36s)]
*  guy? I just, I don't understand what they're doing. And as we talked about Sunday, it's the kind of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=713.36s)]
*  stuff you do when you're beholden to your superstar at all times. And he's like, I get, I like Klay [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=717.76s)]
*  Thompson. Let's get him on the team. I don't think he made sense for him. The Rosen makes a little [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=722.96s)]
*  more sense, but even that doesn't solve the problem of how are you going to get stops? They never got [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=727.44s)]
*  stops against Denver for two straight years in the playoffs over and over again. Denver would come [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=732.64s)]
*  back and beat them in the fourth quarter. I'd be more worried about that. Last thing before we get [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=737.52s)]
*  to the rest of the pod is what's going on with the Boston Celtics. And that's a two tiered question. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=742.72s)]
*  And it's weird for a team that just won the title and then took care of Jason Tatum and Derrick White. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  And you would think like, man, Celtics looking great. The second apron stuff is alarming. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=752.1600000000001s)]
*  If you just look for this season, they're paying 84 million for Brown and Tatum. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=758.0s)]
*  Now with the White extension, which doesn't kick in for a year, but 79.4 million for Drew and KP [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=762.32s)]
*  and White. And then another 20.4 million for Horford, Prichard, Cornett and Sam Houser. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=770.08s)]
*  And then another 10.5 million for guys who aren't even in the rotation. So their salary is heading [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=777.2800000000001s)]
*  toward 200 million. If you add the extra slots, the tax will be 30 million. When you get into some [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=782.08s)]
*  of the penalty stuff, that's another 50 million. So this will be like a $275 million team next year, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  which is expensive. And don't quote me on that number, but it'll be in that neighborhood. But [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=795.52s)]
*  then the next year is when it gets horrible. And this is what a lot of my Celtics techs have been [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=800.96s)]
*  about with the people I know who love the team. 2025-26, Tatum and Brown, because the Tatum [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=804.88s)]
*  extension now kicks in. Tatum's at 54.1, Brown would be at 53.1. So those two guys, 107.2 million [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=813.28s)]
*  together. That's fine. A lot of teams are paying two guys a lot, but then Drew and KP and White are [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=819.68s)]
*  now at 91.2 million. So you have five guys for 198.4. And then you have your next four guys who are on [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  our contract. Prichard, the rookie, Shireman, Jordan Walsh, Kata. That's another 14.3. Every salary [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=834.3199999999999s)]
*  slots, like between one and a half, two million bucks. From a tax standpoint, they're going to be [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=844.56s)]
*  between like 45 and 50 million. And then when you kick in repeater tax and all these other penalties, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=849.92s)]
*  it could be like a $250 million tax, assuming they don't trade poor Zingas or Drew or White, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=857.76s)]
*  combined with the payroll of the team, which makes it like a $450 million check [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  for the 2026 Celtics. Oh my God. And it might be higher than that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=874.0s)]
*  On the one hand, you got to do it because you're trying to win a title. On the other hand, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=881.04s)]
*  I find it hard to believe they're going to bite the bullet like that two years in a row, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=884.72s)]
*  because this year they're going to do it because they have a chance to go back to back. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=889.12s)]
*  Next year is the year. Horford's coming off, you know, and even with that, that price is still that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=892.16s)]
*  high. But I just find it hard to believe those five guys make it back together two years from now. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=899.2s)]
*  And this is the problem with the apron. And this is really my issue with the CBA. And I'm going to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  sound like I'm a bitchy Celtic fan, but you should be able to get rewarded for homegrown guys who [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  turned into superstars. And I feel that way if it's Dallas with Luca, if it's Golden State with [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=916.72s)]
*  Curry, if it's the Celtics with Tatum and Brown, if it's Cleveland with Mobley and Garland, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=922.24s)]
*  every year you have a guy that you draft on your team. There should be some sort of bonus for the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=928.96s)]
*  team because what the league should actually want, if they really cared about this shit, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=934.88s)]
*  which I'm not positive they do, because if they cared about the overall health of the league, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=939.2s)]
*  the schedule wouldn't be 82 games, right? We wouldn't be in this situation where it's roulette [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=944.72s)]
*  every summer with guys just jumping around and 15 teams that are unhappy and 20 superstars and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=950.32s)]
*  stars that are unhappy. And we would just try to fix some of this and we're not trying to fix it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=956.48s)]
*  And one of the things we should fix is the continuity piece and rewarding franchises [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=961.7600000000001s)]
*  for continuity, for drafting players correctly, for keeping nucleuses together should be what [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=968.32s)]
*  the league wants. What the Celtics have should be the platonic idea of the team. What Phoenix has [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=974.88s)]
*  is the opposite. Just telling somebody to spend a ton of money, give away all your picks, and just [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=981.92s)]
*  every year you're just grabbing people off the bargain aisle to try to put your team together. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=987.92s)]
*  That's not what the league should be and that's not what good basketball is. One of the reasons [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=994.48s)]
*  the Celtics were so good last year was because those guys had scars together. Tatum and Brown [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=998.72s)]
*  have been playing together seven years. Sometimes I wonder, because I do think Adam Silver cares [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1003.92s)]
*  about this stuff, whether he wants to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty on is another [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1013.12s)]
*  matter. But I think ultimately the league should care about good basketball, right? Denver, who [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1019.28s)]
*  had to lose KCP this summer because they're afraid of the tax. No, they owned by Stan Cronkite. He [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1024.8s)]
*  shouldn't have been afraid of the tax, but he should have kept KCP for three years, 66. Supposedly [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1030.4s)]
*  they offered nearly as much or as much as Orlando did and still lost them. But Denver, who drafted [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1034.64s)]
*  Murray, who drafted Jokic, and who drafted Porter should get some sort of benefit over the fact that [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1043.6000000000001s)]
*  they ran their team really well. So basically what they've done with this whole system is they're so [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  desperate to create parity and to not have that bottom half of teams that suck that they're [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1058.0s)]
*  penalized the teams that are smart. And I think this initially started with trying to penalize [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1064.24s)]
*  a situation like the Warriors where the Warriors are just like, we'll spend whatever it takes. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1069.68s)]
*  We don't care about payroll. We don't care about tax. We're just going to do whatever. I get it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1073.52s)]
*  You want to protect that. But I think you also want to protect continuity and ingenuity. And this [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1077.2s)]
*  is what's been lost. So you look at this Celtics thing, which stayed, all they did was [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1083.6s)]
*  make great draft picks and really smart trades and they're still getting penalized by it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  And you'd be like, well, that's sour grapes. You're a Celtics fan. Of course you're saying [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1093.76s)]
*  that, but it's the same for the nuggets. You know, so it's too late now to fix it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1096.7199999999998s)]
*  I guess what bugs me is we're probably not going to see great runs again. Like what we saw with [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  the Warriors and why it was emotional when Klay Thompson got bounced from Golden State because [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1110.32s)]
*  it was, and people are like, it was the end of an era. That was the greatest backcourt ever. It was [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1116.3999999999999s)]
*  like, yeah, it was also the end of something that's probably not going to exist anymore. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jM6UZwprk&t=1119.6799999999998s)]
