# Minnesota’s Coming, OKC’s Here + Why The NBA Finals Should Go Thru July | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls)
*  All right, Kurt Goldsberry is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=0.0s)]
*  You can read him on the ringer.com. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1.56s)]
*  You can listen to him on various ringer podcasts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4.28s)]
*  He is based in Austin, Texas, where we saw each other after a depressing Spurs [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  Sun game, Sun's game with no Wemby and with the Sun's team imploding. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=12.96s)]
*  Um, we have something really good that we're going to talk about later in the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=17.84s)]
*  pod, this big picture idea that I'm excited to throw at the world short-term. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  There's been some stuff going on as we hit these last 20 games. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=27.040000000000003s)]
*  And I talked about this with Rossello two Sundays ago, that there's always a team [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  right around now that starts making a surge like Dallas did last year, like the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=35.6s)]
*  Celtics did a couple of years ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=40.36s)]
*  And it's like, who, who's the team? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=41.88s)]
*  We talked about possibilities, kind of glossed over Minnesota and Minnesota [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=43.6s)]
*  kicked Denver's ass last night. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=48.84s)]
*  The three point shooting has gotten way better. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=50.84s)]
*  There are 11 and O and the last 11 Randall games, stuff's kind of happening [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=53.36s)]
*  yet they're in the seventh seed Golden States, 37, 28, Minnesota's 38 and 29. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=58.76s)]
*  Um, are you a believer yet? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=64.0s)]
*  Easy schedule, just a great matchup for them against Denver. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=66.08s)]
*  Is something happening? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=70.12s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=71.28s)]
*  Well, I've always liked this team and I feel like, uh, they traded [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=72.72s)]
*  Carl Anthony towns in part because of the new CBA. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=76.72s)]
*  And I think it sort of took them off course. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=79.52s)]
*  I'm a believer that they're going to finish this season very [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  strong for a few reasons. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=85.88s)]
*  One, you just pointed out Julius Randall is playing his best stretch of basketball [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=87.08s)]
*  since he's gotten to Minnesota. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=90.88s)]
*  Um, he missed pretty much all of February. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=92.8s)]
*  That's important because they went five to seven in February, but they won [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=95.8s)]
*  those last 11 games with him, I think five in January, now six straight in March. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  Well, what are you saying? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  That's what's he doing differently? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=105.56s)]
*  Cause in the, in the first part of the year, it looked like a bad spacing fit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=107.16s)]
*  It looked like a weird who's who should take the shot this time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=111.8s)]
*  And it just, it just seemed off. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=115.12s)]
*  So what changed? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=116.76s)]
*  I think he's playing, he knows his teammates better and he's making better [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=117.76s)]
*  passes like at his best, he's a scorer who can also pass and I think during [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=120.88s)]
*  this stretch, I haven't looked it up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=124.92s)]
*  I think he's leading the team in assists. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=126.24s)]
*  So you have, you have go bear, obviously as the defensive anchor, you know, what [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=128.16s)]
*  Ant is going to do as a scorer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=132.2s)]
*  I think he's sort of your second score and maybe your primary playmaker. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=134.08s)]
*  Uh, when things are going well for him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=138.52s)]
*  Um, and without him, their second score bill, that's a pretty big [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  question mark for this team. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=144.48s)]
*  So I think his biggest thing is scoring and playmaking and just filling that void [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=146.32s)]
*  below Ant on the box score. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=151.56s)]
*  Um, and here's the sneaky thing with this team. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=154.0s)]
*  They have the easiest remaining schedule of all of the Western Conference [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  competitive sort of teams, that top seven group, and it's by a landslide. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=162.28s)]
*  They have this home stand where Orlando, Utah, Indiana, and two games [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=167.44s)]
*  against the Pelicans coming in. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=171.68s)]
*  This current win streak could extend to 11 very easily. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=173.56s)]
*  And I think if there's anybody that's going to catch that group two to five on [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=178.16s)]
*  the Western Conference standings, uh, it's the Minnesota Timberwolves. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=182.16s)]
*  So I really like their chances of finishing the season pretty strong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=185.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=188.84s)]
*  It's interesting because in this run, they're 16 and nine in their last 25, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=189.04s)]
*  basically, um, I think 16 and eight last 24. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=193.68s)]
*  So the, the, the records better, the schedule has been pretty easy, but they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=196.88s)]
*  did go two and one against OKC and they beat Denver twice, which I think are good [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  signs, especially now that the Lakers don't have a center, maybe those are the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=205.96s)]
*  two teams they have to look at. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  I was studying it today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  I test wise, I didn't really notice it until the last week. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Um, just that they seem happier playing together. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=217.04s)]
*  I thought last night they looked like last year's Timberwolves was noticeable. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=219.84s)]
*  They might feel like they have Denver's number. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=223.8s)]
*  But looking at all the numbers, the three point shooting is way better. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=226.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=231.56s)]
*  So, uh, Nas in his last 25, he's 41% from three and he's 18 and seven and he's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  having a really nice free agent run. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=239.0s)]
*  We talked about him on the worst contracts pod talking about how all these moves [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=240.52s)]
*  they've made, especially the go bear extension might have screwed them to keep Nas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=245.32s)]
*  And then Timberwolves fans are like, we're keeping Nas. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  It's like, well, you made this Carl Anthony town straight to save money. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Which leads me to believe you're not keeping Nas, especially if, uh, if you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=257.08s)]
*  have this new ownership, but who knows he's playing 33 minutes a game. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  Um, and he's been great. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=265.28s)]
*  Conley in his last 17 is shooting 48% from three and he looked like dead, dead [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  legs washed up the first six weeks of the season, right? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  That surprised me more than anything. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=274.64s)]
*  I didn't think they were going to get anything out of him anymore. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  And it seemed like he wasn't going to be able to play a crunch time for them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=278.68s)]
*  And then deep in Shenzo is the other one since Christmas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  He's missed some games, but 16 points a game, 47% from three. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  And he's playing 29 minutes a game. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  So you say how they don't have a second score and you're right, but they've been [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  able to patch it like nozzle, have a big game, Dante have a big game, Randall might [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  have like, it feels like they're all rotating. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  Who's the second guy? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=302.84s)]
*  Um, and they're pretty good. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=304.44s)]
*  I'm surprised Dillingham isn't having a bigger impact for them, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  but maybe they don't need them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=309.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  Dillingham is, is a nice rookie story, but like, come on, we, we, we're talking [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  about a team that had Western conference title aspirations at the beginning of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=316.64s)]
*  year and a rookie really isn't going to slide into that and make a lot of noise. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  I think D even tens of is a great, great sort of similar thing to Randall. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=323.4s)]
*  He's, he's gotten time to learn this team. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=327.4s)]
*  He's fitting in. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=329.88s)]
*  Um, but remember last year, I thought this team had the best vibes in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=331.08s)]
*  the playoffs for awhile and a lot of it had to do with Nas Reed, who is like the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=334.64s)]
*  spirit animal of the whole Timberwolves fan base, never say anything negative [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=339.8s)]
*  about Nas Reed bill, uh, Alexander Walker. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=343.64s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=346.8s)]
*  He's going to be on New Orleans next year, but you guys are right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=347.16s)]
*  Or Washington, wherever he's going to go. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=350.0s)]
*  Somebody with calf space Brooklyn. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=351.68s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=353.44s)]
*  But they're big and they're physical and they're long and they gave, you know, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=354.2s)]
*  what everybody forgets, like they give, they give some, they gave Jamal Murray [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=357.16s)]
*  a lot of problems last night. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=361.48s)]
*  They gave MBJ a lot of problems last night. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=362.64s)]
*  Uh, when they're really at their best, you know, they have McDaniels on [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=365.36s)]
*  defense, uh, they're long on the perimeter, they're playing hard. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=369.24s)]
*  And when those same dudes that are playing great perimeter defense are also knocking [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=373.08s)]
*  out shots like that, there's a really good team that's a really good team. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=376.6s)]
*  And I like it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Uh, and there was a couple of times last night where I thought Randall, like, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=381.0s)]
*  yes, like what it looks like he'll just take it right at, uh, Joker and just [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  overpower him. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=388.76s)]
*  And that's another thing he can do is, is go get an unassisted bucket, uh, in a [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=389.88s)]
*  way that some of these catch and shoot guys can't do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=394.92s)]
*  Sounds like he's won you over. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=397.48s)]
*  It sounds like the Randall fan club might have to make room for you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=398.96s)]
*  Dude, he is like the ultimate hot and cold analytics guy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=402.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  Even there are even whole seasons, Bill, where you're like, this guy's terrible. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=406.2s)]
*  And then the next season, you're like, this guy's an all star. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=410.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  If he has sort of a legacy for the stats nerds, it's like, he is the hardest guy [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=413.44s)]
*  to pin down maybe in the whole league. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  Uh, and so he's, he's been a frustrating guy to characterize even through the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  most advanced numbers, uh, over the last five years. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=424.52s)]
*  Well, they also have this weird bench because Shannon had a couple of really [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=427.92s)]
*  good games for them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=433.48s)]
*  Like when they beat okay. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  See by three last, last month, end of February, Shannon played 29 minutes in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=436.24s)]
*  that game, Alexander Walker played 35, McDaniel's played 42, Nas played 40. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=442.24s)]
*  They didn't have go bear. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=448.8s)]
*  They didn't have Randall, but they, they're able to the nine through 11 guys, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=450.2s)]
*  which is something I think Cleveland has. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=454.08s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=455.92s)]
*  I think the Celtics have to some degree in okay. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=456.76s)]
*  See, it's 20 guys. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=459.6s)]
*  It literally doesn't matter. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=462.68s)]
*  See, they could be like, Oh, Jalen Williams isn't playing fine. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=462.92s)]
*  We got three more guys. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=465.24s)]
*  We could just slide in there, but, um, I do like their depth and they have a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  little more depth Minnesota than, uh, I was thinking it also seems like they're [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=470.48s)]
*  getting a little more than McDaniel's was starting to look like a possible worst [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=474.0s)]
*  contracts guy, but he got going too. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  And then, you know, the, the, the big thing for me, when you're thinking about [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=480.16s)]
*  the late surgers is, do you have like one of the best nine guys? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you have one of the best guys? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=487.16s)]
*  You have one of the best six guys. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  Edwards is somewhere in the 10. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=490.16s)]
*  You know, you could have them, you could have them eight, you got nine, wherever. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=493.92s)]
*  But, uh, during this little 24 game stretch where they're 16 and eight, he's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=497.68s)]
*  29 a game, 8.9 free throw attempts and 10.4 threes. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=502.0s)]
*  And I, I mentioned that because I felt like the threes were too high before. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=507.48s)]
*  And I want, I, I ultimately like in the playoffs, I think the free throws [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  have to be next to the threes. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=517.24s)]
*  I want like in a playoff series, I want 10 and 10 from him, something like that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=519.2s)]
*  But, um, you know, he has some stinkers every once in a while. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=523.24s)]
*  He'll have like the six for 19. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=528.0s)]
*  He'll have the seven for 29, but for the most part, like, I'm kind of happy [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=529.6s)]
*  where he's at in this season after the season, where are you at with them? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=534.6s)]
*  I think he's ready to be the best player on a playoff team. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=539.44s)]
*  That's going to win one, maybe two rounds. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=542.16s)]
*  It's hard for me to see them win in two rounds, just out of respect [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=544.12s)]
*  for the rest of the West. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=547.36s)]
*  Although one of the more sort of emergent stories with last night is they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=548.76s)]
*  give the nuggets a very difficult time. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=554.64s)]
*  And it's not just last night. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=557.68s)]
*  I think it's five straight against them. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=559.28s)]
*  Um, and it is because Jamal Murray, who has been great, you know, the nuggets [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=561.64s)]
*  are, you know, you, you, you can set your watch by this guy's going to be great, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=568.36s)]
*  but Jamal Murray, they seem to have his number. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=571.56s)]
*  And I think if you can slow down Jamal Murray, you have a good chance to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=575.1199999999999s)]
*  beat the nuggets in the playoffs. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=579.2399999999999s)]
*  And I think this team is built to slow down the Jamal Murray's of the world, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=581.0s)]
*  because of their perimeter defenders. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  Uh, and I think Anthony Edwards is just the kind of fourth quarter crunch [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=587.64s)]
*  time score, go get a free throw, go get a bucket. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=593.64s)]
*  I think he's there. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  Um, and I think they're really well rounded. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=598.3599999999999s)]
*  The last thing I'd add, Bill is I do like their coaching. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=600.04s)]
*  I like their coaching staff. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=602.8399999999999s)]
*  I think they're built for a playoff series. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=604.24s)]
*  I think they make adjustments. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=606.8399999999999s)]
*  I think they're not one of these coaching staffs that just goes in [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=608.48s)]
*  and does what they always do. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=611.48s)]
*  Uh, so I like how they're built. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=613.36s)]
*  Um, and depending on the matchups, which I think is the biggest story [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  in the Western conference, Bill going into this last 20 game stretch, 15 [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  game stretch, how these seeds shake out is going to be fascinating. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=622.12s)]
*  Who gets who in the first round is going to determine a lot of who makes it to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=627.0799999999999s)]
*  the conference finals, because some of these matchups are really good for one [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=631.92s)]
*  side and really bad for the other. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=635.5999999999999s)]
*  And, and I think that Minnesota Denver matchup is a great example of that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=637.0s)]
*  It's a great point. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=641.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=642.76s)]
*  See 16 and eight in their last 24, including four losses of either one or [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  two points fifth net rating, and they play okay. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  See really well too, which we should mention Denver. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=651.56s)]
*  They're built to be Denver and they have all these athletic wings to throw up [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  Murray and they have size to throw not as much size as they had last year with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=658.08s)]
*  towns, but they still have a bunch of size to throw a yolkage and you know, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  they're, it's just a good matchup for them. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=666.88s)]
*  Doesn't mean they'll beat them in the playoffs, but it's a nice matchup. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=671.48s)]
*  See, he was interesting because when they played those games and I thought those [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=671.84s)]
*  games were really fun to watch, there was a competitiveness, fuck you, uh, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=676.32s)]
*  athleticism piece that you rarely let physicality you saw, we're going to talk [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=682.52s)]
*  about, okay, see Boston in a second. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=688.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=690.08s)]
*  See, even though that I think the myth on them is they're undersized when they're [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=690.4s)]
*  really not anymore, um, or they're skinny, uh, they're really physical. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=693.72s)]
*  And I thought, I think Minnesota likes it and they like playing it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=699.64s)]
*  And I thought those games, I thought that was a good sign for them that they hung [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=702.6s)]
*  with them, they also have a lot of guys to throw at SGA who nobody has shut down [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=705.96s)]
*  all year, but they probably have the best chance, you know, and then, uh, and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=709.72s)]
*  they have a guy on their team who's not afraid of any of them. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  You mentioned the matchups. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=718.0400000000001s)]
*  So we're taping this in the morning on Thursday and Golden State and Minnesota [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  are basically fighting for the sixth seed. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=724.48s)]
*  Golden State is 37 wins. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=726.64s)]
*  Minnesota is 38, but Minnesota has played more games. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=728.36s)]
*  And there's a world where Minnesota gets six and Denver gets three. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=732.0s)]
*  And that's our three six and Denver's like, fucking a God damn it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  Why, why is that our team? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=741.76s)]
*  Um, just the matchups in general, like Golden State, I'm sure. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  What doesn't want to see Denver at all. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=749.48s)]
*  Cause Yoko Jones them. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=752.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  Minnesota would be delighted to see Denver. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=754.76s)]
*  You just go through and it's like what you said, it's becomes a little rock [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=756.88s)]
*  paper, scissory. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=760.24s)]
*  I was waiting for Houston to drop out, but Houston's kind of hung on here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=761.24s)]
*  Houston. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=765.72s)]
*  So as a three game, three loss lead over Golden State and a four last lead over [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=766.12s)]
*  Minnesota and they're the five seed. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=769.72s)]
*  And then the Lakers who, you know, we don't know how long LeBron's going to be out. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=771.84s)]
*  That's another team that could potentially drop, but they'd have to [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=775.88s)]
*  drop a lot down the stretch. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=778.12s)]
*  So, uh, a lot of shit going on, but we could end up listening to this Goldsbury. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=780.24s)]
*  We could have Minnesota, Denver is a three six. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=784.44s)]
*  We could have Golden State, Memphis as a two seven, and we could have Lakers [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=789.48s)]
*  Houston as the four five with Emma Adoka and Dylan Brooks against LeBron. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=794.88s)]
*  The two guys who have really gone at him in the last two years. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=800.64s)]
*  That'd be super fun. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=803.32s)]
*  And then the other one that's in play is the one eight with okay. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=804.36s)]
*  Seeing the Clippers, you know, the Clippers trade SGA to okay. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=808.32s)]
*  They make this okay. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=813.96s)]
*  See has their pick this year and there's just all this history between those [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=815.24s)]
*  teams. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=818.28s)]
*  So, uh, that would be the most fun version I think of the four matchups. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=818.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=823.16s)]
*  Another thing to watch on strength of schedule. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=823.8s)]
*  Cause the Western conference is brutal depending on, on how your schedule [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=825.56s)]
*  sort of shakes out the Lakers and the Grizzlies are on the opposite end. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  They have a very tough remaining schedule. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=833.88s)]
*  So the Lakers sort of hanging onto that fourth spot right now, as you mentioned [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=835.96s)]
*  without LeBron James, uh, the Rockets have won four straight. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=839.96s)]
*  They could surpass them. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=844.24s)]
*  You could see a world where the Lakers, the Timberwolves and the Warriors are [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=845.88s)]
*  really good teams, but all going into these first round series as a road team. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=851.64s)]
*  Um, and many of them with championship experience, obviously the, the Warriors [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=856.4s)]
*  and Lakers have some, uh, some championship experience. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=861.12s)]
*  So it's really interesting to me. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=864.52s)]
*  I think in a nutshell, the hottest teams out West, not counting the thunder [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=866.04s)]
*  have been hot all year or the six and seven right now, uh, in the Warriors [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=870.08s)]
*  and Timberwolves and that just, that just sets us up for a great, great first round. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=873.8s)]
*  Not to mention the talent over there, the superstar talent, the all star talent [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=878.64s)]
*  fighting for these slots is just off the charts. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=883.0s)]
*  Well, what's funny is Minnesota is a really good road team. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=885.9599999999999s)]
*  They're 20 and 15 now on the road, which I think other than OKC is [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=889.76s)]
*  the best record in the West. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=893.36s)]
*  The Clippers are a terrible road team. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=895.24s)]
*  They're 14 and 20. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=897.04s)]
*  I don't think the Lakers care where they play and they're going to, they're going [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=898.8s)]
*  to have Laker fans at any whatever. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=903.24s)]
*  I think it matters for Houston though. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=905.64s)]
*  Houston, I kept waiting to fall off. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=907.72s)]
*  Um, and it felt like it was going to happen a couple of times, but they're [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=910.6s)]
*  kind of lingering around, hanging around and Lakers Houston would be a really, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  really fun kind of old school new, new school series. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=919.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know how the Lakers are going to hold on if LeBron misses three to four [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=923.0s)]
*  weeks here and who knows we we've seen him recover really fast sometimes and [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=926.96s)]
*  recover really slow other times when there was less at stake, but when you [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=932.08s)]
*  take him out of it, but you take his, you take the rebounding defense, second [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=936.36s)]
*  playmaker thing on top of all the other stuff they've already lost and it just [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=941.5600000000001s)]
*  feels like insurmountable for them. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=945.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=947.76s)]
*  They'd lost that game in Brooklyn the other night. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=948.0s)]
*  And I think that's a fair indication of the kind of game they can lose. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=950.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=953.64s)]
*  You know, and again, the West is just jam packed. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  I think two to five is separated by a game or something like that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=956.2s)]
*  Um, so you start losing at Brooklyn. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=959.72s)]
*  You're going to drop the Rockets, as you mentioned, are hot. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=962.44s)]
*  They've won four straight. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=965.4s)]
*  Uh, they're gonna, they're going to win, uh, those, those kinds of games. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=966.84s)]
*  Um, so it is, I think it is fair to expect the Lakers are going to drop. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=970.72s)]
*  And maybe their next ones are at Denver Friday, home sons, home spurs. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=975.36s)]
*  Might be able to go two and one in those three home nuggets, home bucks, home [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=983.0s)]
*  bulls, Josh Giddy Renaissance is here. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=988.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=991.48s)]
*  At Orlando, at Indiana, at Chicago, at Memphis home Rockets. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=992.68s)]
*  That's the rest of the month. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  So they have to go 500 of that in that stage. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=999.04s)]
*  But, um, do you care if you're the, if you're the, uh, seven seed, so you're [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  probably playing the Clippers in the seven eight game, right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  With real stakes because you don't want to see any part of OKC in round one. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1012.5999999999999s)]
*  Um, and you're playing the Clippers at home. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1017.92s)]
*  Like it would suck to be the seventh seed and have the extra game, but if I'm [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1020.88s)]
*  going to state I'm fine, you know, all right, fine, we'll beat the Clippers in the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1023.64s)]
*  seven eight and we'll just play the two seed. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  Like it's not a complete disaster. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1029.6s)]
*  It's a disaster if you lose them. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1031.44s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1033.72s)]
*  You got Kawhi Leonard, Tai Lu on the other end. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1035.04s)]
*  You got one game. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1038.48s)]
*  I love the plan tournament because it makes these sets up for real meaningful games. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1039.6399999999999s)]
*  And you know, I think the executives and the coaches at these teams much prefer [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1045.44s)]
*  the six slot to the seven slot just because of the uncertainty, the stress. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1049.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1052.8000000000002s)]
*  The you're locked in. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1053.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1054.8000000000002s)]
*  They, and you let you get nothing. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1055.2s)]
*  Other than a couple of days to game plan your, your three seat opponent in a [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1056.52s)]
*  playoff, uh, matchup, and that's a huge deal too. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1059.44s)]
*  So do you like the seven eight nine 10 or would you go seven 10 eight nine? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1062.2800000000002s)]
*  I like, I like how they have it because if you finished seventh, I think you've [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1068.44s)]
*  got to get beat twice at home to get kicked out of, I like the format. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1071.88s)]
*  I think the seven eight format is cool. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1076.48s)]
*  You know, and it gives you this advantage to get in. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1078.32s)]
*  Um, what are your thoughts on that? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1081.6399999999999s)]
*  I, part of me wonders if it should be seven 10 eight nine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1084.04s)]
*  And then the seven still doesn't necessarily. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1088.84s)]
*  It's not a winner go home for the seven 10. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1093.12s)]
*  They would still get to play the eight nine with home court, but the way they [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1095.56s)]
*  have it, I think probably makes more sense. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1099.08s)]
*  And the seven eight is usually a really good game. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1100.72s)]
*  I mean, part of the problem with the plan this year is the 10 seat in both [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1102.4399999999998s)]
*  conferences sucks. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1106.2s)]
*  Like we're it's at least in the, uh, in the West, they have an excuse cause of [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1108.32s)]
*  what happened to Dallas, the zombie Mavericks, but they're still the 10 seed. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1115.0s)]
*  The zombie Mavericks was Spencer Dinwiddie and, uh, I don't even know what center [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  they'd have left and PJ Washington. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1124.9199999999998s)]
*  They might actually be the 10 seed. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1126.76s)]
*  Phoenix is just like, guys, we've been trying to make this clear for two months. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1128.52s)]
*  We want to have the season from how we don't want to be in there, but you go to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  the, the East and it's like, all right, Chicago, that Chicago's 27 and 38. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1135.68s)]
*  It might be in the, it might be in there. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1143.48s)]
*  And then you look at Miami who's 29 and 36. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1145.4s)]
*  They've lost five Joe house on the ringer gambling show for the last two weeks. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1148.0s)]
*  He's convinced Miami's tanking and his thing on the last two weeks on the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1152.2800000000002s)]
*  ringer gambling show is bet against them. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1156.2s)]
*  Second half live bet against them. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1158.2800000000002s)]
*  They take a lead first half. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1160.48s)]
*  Then they throw it away. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1161.88s)]
*  Second half. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1162.68s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, but they're a fucking mess and [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1163.32s)]
*  BAM looks terrible lately. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1166.12s)]
*  Um, anyway, I think the nine 10 in the East has a chance to be one of the more [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1167.96s)]
*  depressing playing games we've had. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1173.28s)]
*  Maybe the number one. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1175.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1176.36s)]
*  Bulls heat, uh, who don't even want their pick. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1176.68s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1181.48s)]
*  You just hope that the Orlando magic, cause the magic in the Hawks, they could, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1182.8s)]
*  they could be decent playoff teams if they awaken from, you know, these, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  these pretty dark stretches. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1191.16s)]
*  But how long do we have to wait for Orlando? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1192.8400000000001s)]
*  Apparently longer than two months. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1195.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  So Rudy's right. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1196.8400000000001s)]
*  Magic or dead sucks is out for the year. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1197.6000000000001s)]
*  Like the magic or a cross-off to me at land at least has all of these wings [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1199.48s)]
*  when they get everybody back and healthy. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1205.6000000000001s)]
*  And then, and then the random Trey young, who the hell knows game. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1207.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1210.64s)]
*  And they have some size that could always be the con, a con glue in a playing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1211.2800000000002s)]
*  game with like 24 rebounds. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1215.5600000000002s)]
*  I feel like Orlando is a cross-off. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1218.1200000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1219.88s)]
*  So Rudy. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1220.2s)]
*  Ooh, I think the calves and Celtics deserve to have a pretty easy first round [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1220.96s)]
*  series. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1226.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1226.52s)]
*  I think they will. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1227.28s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1228.0s)]
*  The calves are going to get Orlando, Miami or Chicago. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1228.6000000000001s)]

*  So you in Boston quickly, uh, the bottom seven right now, Washington 13 wins, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1378.32s)]
*  Utah 15, Charlotte 16, New Orleans 18. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1384.28s)]
*  That's going to be our bottom four for capture the flag. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1389.24s)]
*  Then we have Philly 22 wins, Brooklyn 22 wins, Toronto 23 wins. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1393.52s)]
*  Roussela is furious. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1399.36s)]
*  Toronto is making a run at their season over out of nowhere, even though [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  they were supposed to be tanking. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1403.3999999999999s)]
*  So Philly right now is in the five spot. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1405.08s)]
*  They keep their pick if it's in the top six and they're doing everything that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1407.3999999999999s)]
*  they scratch Paul George for reasons that remain unclear for the season and beads [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1411.36s)]
*  out and Philly's going for it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1415.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think if they get the five spot, it'd be pretty hard for them to get jumped [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1417.3999999999999s)]
*  twice. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1420.24s)]

*  Oh, wow. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1439.08s)]
*  It was the Luka Doncic trade. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1440.48s)]
*  The Luka Doncic trade, uh, the Paul George deal did not get the transaction of the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1442.44s)]
*  year, but it was given to, uh, the Los Angeles Lakers. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1447.6s)]
*  But yeah, I got to see the Boston Celtics play the Philadelphia 76ers more like the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  Dell Delaware 87ers than the night I chose to attend. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1456.12s)]
*  Yeah, tough one. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1459.6399999999999s)]
*  Tough one. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1460.96s)]
*  They're two and eight in their last 10. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1461.48s)]
*  Uh, they are doing all they can as they should. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1463.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1466.48s)]
*  There's the saving the season for the Philadelphia 76ers is keeping that draft [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1466.72s)]
*  pick in a good draft. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1471.2s)]
*  That would be really good draft. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1472.8799999999999s)]
*  If you get in the top five in this draft, you're getting like a legit dude. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1474.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1478.52s)]
*  And so they have to do this. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1479.0800000000002s)]
*  How crazy would that be after all the hype and buzz about them? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1480.4s)]
*  If they ended up with like a top three pick? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1485.0s)]
*  I mean, that honestly, that'd be insane. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1488.0800000000002s)]
*  What were the odds? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1490.6000000000001s)]
*  I guess the ads were actually half decent. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1492.3200000000002s)]
*  Um, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1494.68s)]
*  I'll remember even forget the Georgian and the Georgian, um, and beat stuff. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1495.48s)]
*  They have a pretty good young back court and McCain and Maxie here. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1499.8000000000002s)]
*  Like the, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1502.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1503.2s)]
*  That they could have a young core if they hit on this draft. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1503.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1507.84s)]
*  So it's, it's crazy. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1508.16s)]
*  I know the cap, they're in cap hell. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1509.2s)]
*  They are in cap hell for the rest of this decade. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1511.0s)]
*  But if they have rookie players playing over value, that's a pretty good [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1513.6399999999999s)]
*  deodorant for that situation. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1518.44s)]
*  The Embiid thing's tough. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1520.52s)]
*  We've been this down this road with, uh, injured older centers and you're just [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1521.68s)]
*  kind of held hostage by it for a couple of years and then somebody will write [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1526.92s)]
*  the story and beads knee feels the best that's ever been and Embiid full [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1531.04s)]
*  scrimmage today and then he plays two games and gets hurt again and it's just [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1534.68s)]
*  this cycle you don't want to be in. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1537.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, Washington, Utah, Charlotte, New Orleans, the shocker in that group is [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1539.8799999999999s)]
*  the New Orleans. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1545.28s)]
*  We knew somebody in the West was going to have the year from hell and they [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1546.56s)]
*  were a really good candidate, but to, for them to be in the top four of the [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1550.0s)]
*  lottery is nuts with the kind of talent they have. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1553.32s)]
*  I mean, honestly, it's crazy. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1555.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1557.84s)]
*  They they're deep. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1558.1599999999999s)]
*  That was the, they can survive a few injuries, you'd think. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1559.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1562.28s)]
*  And still better than this. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1562.6s)]
*  Better than this. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, so here are my OKC Celtics takes and we might, we might call my dad at the [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1566.36s)]
*  tail end cause he went to the game after, after you go, but, um, I, first of all, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1571.6399999999999s)]
*  OKC has beaten Boston twice and I watched both games and I thought they deserved to [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1576.68s)]
*  win both games and I thought SJ was the best player in each game. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1581.92s)]
*  Uh, there was no KP last night, but OKC didn't have Jaylen Williams. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1585.8400000000001s)]
*  So I'm not going to make excuses. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1589.68s)]
*  The free throw advantage was way skewed toward OKC. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1592.2s)]
*  I'd thought that was more a result of how both teams played and what they're [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1595.24s)]
*  trying to do the Celtics took 63 threes, which is fucking absurd. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1598.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, but the thing that, that has jumped out to me over and over again with [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1603.52s)]
*  OKC, they play so fucking hard and they're so physical and they're so good [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1607.4s)]
*  defensively and the switching that they do, and they're just so committed to a [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1613.52s)]
*  certain level of intensity and competitiveness is going to sound like I'm [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1618.0s)]
*  making an excuse for the Celtics and I'm not, I think I've watched it over and [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1622.2s)]
*  over again, I think teams have a lot of trouble going through an MBA schedule [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1625.92s)]
*  and then you play OKC and they're playing like they play and it's like, you can see [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1630.08s)]
*  it like the guys and then the quotes after the game, Tatum said it, Jaylen [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1634.12s)]
*  Brown said it, like we didn't do a good job of matching their intensity. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1638.96s)]
*  That's been, this is why this OKC team has been so special as a regular season [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1642.4399999999998s)]
*  team, they're fucking animals. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1646.76s)]
*  You watch them. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1649.28s)]
*  It's like every guy in the team is completely beasting out going crazy. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1650.04s)]
*  They're, they're just like, you can, and if you're not ready for it, you can see [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1654.1999999999998s)]
*  it and you can fight back, you can claw back, they do it again and they just over [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1658.6s)]
*  and over again, make these teams look bad from how hard they're playing. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1663.0s)]
*  So my question to you is it's a one night thing that works. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  Could you get used to it over two weeks? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1669.48s)]
*  If you're playing them in a series over the course of seven games, would you [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1671.72s)]
*  eventually figure out how to match what they're doing at least competitively [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1676.28s)]
*  and physically? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1681.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if last year is a fair precedent, but yes, you could if you're, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1683.0s)]
*  you have a really physical strong front court like the Dallas Mavericks did. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1688.04s)]
*  Uh, that seems like a thousand years ago now, but yeah, it seems, it seems like. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1692.0800000000002s)]
*  They are by far the most physical nasty defense and, and that depth really [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  enables them to play almost like with line changes. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1704.24s)]
*  Uh, they had that perpetual sub story, uh, this year, this week, but they [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1708.28s)]
*  have such a great deep bench. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1713.24s)]
*  Um, but as you mentioned, they didn't have Caruso who's one of the biggest [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1715.6000000000001s)]
*  dogs on the team and they didn't have, uh, Jay Williams didn't notice. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1719.3200000000002s)]
*  Just other guys just came in flying around. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1724.3600000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that crossed my mind yesterday is that could the second [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1726.8400000000001s)]
*  five best players on Oklahoma city be a playoff team by themselves? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1729.72s)]
*  That's the kind of thing I was thinking like, oh my God, this team is so deep. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1733.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1738.04s)]
*  You take one of the backup bigs, you take case on Wallace, you know, you [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1738.3600000000001s)]
*  take one of the Jay Williams, they have so much talent. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1742.64s)]
*  Um, but the coolest thing about them is they're all aligned to play this [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1746.0800000000002s)]
*  ferocious defensive style. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1750.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, one of the crazy stats from that game last night though, it's like, okay, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1752.24s)]
*  the 63 threes, we can talk about that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1756.24s)]
*  They play like that and you only get 12 free throws. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1759.32s)]
*  The Celtics only shot 12 free throws. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1762.24s)]
*  Now Celtics fans might say this or that or the other thing, a lot, like you [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1764.32s)]
*  said, it has to do with your, I mean, it really was, it was nine free throws [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1767.28s)]
*  when the game was being decided. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1771.28s)]
*  So they, they weren't getting in line at all, but the got three at the end. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1773.04s)]
*  And then here's the stat that I thought I was looking at it today. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1776.44s)]
*  SGA again was a magnificent player, but he drew 10 fouls himself on the [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1780.4s)]
*  Boston Celtics, he drew 10 fouls himself. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1785.68s)]
*  He puts you in foul trouble, like it or not. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1789.44s)]
*  And Jaylen Brown was the Celtics player. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1792.72s)]
*  I was most sort of concerned with after this game because he was, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1794.72s)]
*  he got off to a slow start. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1798.96s)]
*  Uh, he started, started getting hot in the fourth, but then he entered, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1800.8400000000001s)]
*  he entered the fourth quarter with two fouls and he fouled out with [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1804.3600000000001s)]
*  three and a half minutes left. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1809.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1810.5600000000002s)]
*  SGA got him twice. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1812.16s)]
*  SGA got him with some of the foul merchants stuff twice, his fourth and fifth [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1813.52s)]
*  fouls, nobody's going to remember that because they remember him foul and [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1817.3999999999999s)]
*  Chet at the end, but he had the fifth foul because of SGA sort of antics [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1819.9199999999998s)]
*  there at the elbow, but SGA does that to you. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1825.0s)]
*  Derek White fouled out at the end. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1829.36s)]
*  SGA needs a nickname, maybe the bonus because he's just always drawing. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1831.56s)]
*  They're just always in the bonus. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1838.9199999999998s)]
*  When does Jaylen Williams and Derek White both foul out in regulation? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1841.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1844.44s)]
*  SGA is a pretty good nickname on its own. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1845.2s)]
*  It's a good acronym, but the bonus is solid. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1847.72s)]
*  I like that one. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1850.16s)]
*  Well, it just, I was looking it up. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1851.4s)]
*  He's drawn 10 or more fouls by himself, like 11 or 12 times this season. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1853.5600000000002s)]
*  Uh, well, it's funny. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1858.3600000000001s)]
*  I was talking to, obviously have a lot of Celtic fans in my life. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1859.0s)]
*  Some of whom don't watch a lot of OKC and all the Celtic fans were so mad at SGA [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1862.3200000000002s)]
*  for like the fucking foul baiting and all that stuff. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1867.96s)]
*  And it's like, this is, he does this every game. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1870.8000000000002s)]
*  He's the hardest guy in the league to guard like hands down. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1873.24s)]
*  Russel and I talked about it the other day when we were talking about the MVP [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1877.24s)]
*  stuff with him or Jokic, she's having one of the best guard seasons in the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1880.24s)]
*  history of the league and I haven't seen a team figure out completely how to guard [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1883.88s)]
*  him yet. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1888.0800000000002s)]
*  You can throw, it seems like part of the strategy is try to throw bigger guys on [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1888.48s)]
*  them like the Celtics did with Brown. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1891.96s)]
*  You think on paper with Derek White and Drew Holliday, perfect guys to go against [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1893.68s)]
*  him, but he always gets the matchup he wants. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1898.4s)]
*  He always gets the shot he wants. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1901.2s)]
*  He's always either able to get to the rim, get a foul or do a little pull up. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1902.64s)]
*  And, uh, I haven't seen anyone stop him yet. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1906.3600000000001s)]
*  And if you're going to make the case for OKC to win the title, it's like they [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1908.3600000000001s)]
*  play harder than everybody else and nobody can stop their best guy. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1913.0800000000002s)]
*  Seems like two pretty good things. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1916.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1919.44s)]
*  You can't hate him for what he's doing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1919.68s)]
*  I mean, he, like we define athletes in different ways, but in the 2020s, we [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1920.88s)]
*  really started to understand that guys who can change direction and decelerate [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1925.88s)]
*  better than other guys are athletes. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1930.1200000000001s)]
*  Those are the, those are top tier athletes. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1932.2s)]
*  Uh, we learned that with Luca and Harden. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1934.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, but this guy just makes it so hard to have proper defensive position. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1937.7600000000002s)]
*  Um, even for guys like Derek White and Jaylen Brown who are incredible at that. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1943.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1947.4s)]
*  And, and then he layers on this off arm, Hardenism where he snakes his left arm [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1947.72s)]
*  when he's dribbling with his right hand into anybody's defensive arms. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1956.48s)]
*  And then he flails and it's there it is. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1960.88s)]
*  And that's what happened to Jaylen Brown on first fifth foul last night. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1962.88s)]
*  So he's [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1966.8s)]
*  Most scorers do this though. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1967.3600000000001s)]
*  That, that, like the thing that the reason I still think Brunson's the best, the [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1969.24s)]
*  best flop foul baiter guy is he's also doing it off the ball. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1972.68s)]
*  He's doing it when he's on defense. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1976.96s)]
*  He's just flopping around like a Marlin. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1978.52s)]
*  SGA is just purely trying to get to the free throw line. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1980.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1983.8s)]
*  Well, there's like whatever trick I can do to get it. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1984.4s)]
*  I looked it up. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1987.1200000000001s)]
*  There's three guys who are drawing six fouls themselves per game. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1987.92s)]
*  In other words, they're fouling out the equivalent of a player on [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  the other team every game. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1993.96s)]
*  And it's you got Jaylen Brunson, your favorite. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1995.24s)]
*  There's SGA and then there's the one guy who actually deserves to be on that [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=1998.92s)]
*  list, Bill, which is the most physical assaulting player in the league right [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2002.72s)]
*  now, which is Janis who, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2007.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were going to say Scoot Henderson. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2008.44s)]
*  Well, and Celtics [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2011.04s)]
*  My guy is back. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2013.64s)]
*  Scoot Henderson. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2014.64s)]
*  It is, didn't he? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2015.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm still alive. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2015.88s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2017.48s)]
*  Dude, he was unbelievable. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2019.0s)]
*  He looked like fucking 2010 Russell Westbrook yesterday. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2020.28s)]
*  I was going nuts. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2023.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2024.96s)]
*  He's still right. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2025.2s)]
*  We're good. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2026.3200000000002s)]
*  We're good on the Scoot Island or whatever we're going to call it. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2026.8400000000001s)]
*  But I would say the Celtics fans also can't complain about this off arm [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2029.72s)]
*  hijinks that Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown both play. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2033.52s)]
*  Listen, that game played the hits for things that are going to drive Celtic [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2037.04s)]
*  fans crazy. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2040.52s)]
*  Tyler Ford as the ref. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2041.2s)]
*  Um, just, just, I think there's a lot of, uh, a lot of, he doesn't like us stuff. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2043.4s)]
*  The free throw advantage spoke for itself. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2048.8s)]
*  SGA is super frustrating. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2051.2400000000002s)]
*  And then Jaylen had his worst game in a couple of years, you know, and you [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2053.44s)]
*  can't survive no KP and a horrible Jaylen game like that. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2058.2s)]
*  If you're growing positives for the Celtics, Tatum was awesome again. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2061.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I just feel like he's gone up. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2066.24s)]
*  Rossella and I, we talked a couple of weeks ago about, I still feel like it's [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2068.24s)]
*  in play that he could make go to that last level. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2072.2799999999997s)]
*  Rossella thought I was being a little too optimistic on it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2076.12s)]
*  I think he's at least gone up a half level and I think there's an intensity [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2079.04s)]
*  and competitiveness to that, that I just don't feel like was totally there. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2082.56s)]
*  That physicality that is just at another level. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2087.48s)]
*  There are also Maz is putting a bunch of minutes on him, which I like and don't [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2090.96s)]
*  like, but like he played 45 against the Lakers and I think 42 last night and he [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2097.0s)]
*  wants to be out there. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2101.8s)]
*  And, um, I think that's the best thing the Celtics have going for them right now. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2103.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2107.52s)]
*  I think bigger win for the thunder than it was a loss for the Celtics. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2107.72s)]
*  And same, I would say about that Cleveland win and the same building, a [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2113.28s)]
*  couple of weeks ago, the comeback win that was bigger for Kenny Atkinson and [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2117.24s)]
*  the calves to win in that building for what's coming down the road. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2121.52s)]
*  Um, again, I don't think there's anything to worry about. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2125.2s)]
*  If there's one thing to worry about in Boston, it's Christophs [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2128.0s)]
*  Przingis like get well soon. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2130.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2132.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's get that guy back. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2133.0s)]
*  He needs to get there before I'd make any judgment about, um, where the [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2135.0s)]
*  Celtics are in this title defense, but dude, he hasn't been there. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2140.4799999999996s)]
*  And then that's an issue. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2144.12s)]
*  We need to get him back in the fold to see this fully fledged Celtics title [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2145.32s)]
*  defense, um, because I think teams like Boston, okay. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2150.2000000000003s)]
*  See are good enough to beat them without Christophs for Zingis. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2152.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that's one of the lessons we've learned over the last few weeks that [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2155.7200000000003s)]
*  the Celtics team isn't quite as dominant as they were last year. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2159.56s)]
*  And maybe that there's better candidates, uh, to upset them in the [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2163.0s)]
*  post-season than there were last year. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2166.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, there's definitely hungrier candidates and hunger becomes such a [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2168.0800000000004s)]
*  big part of this as the season goes along. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2170.88s)]
*  I, uh, it's funny, like I'll get texts from people sometimes, or I'll hear it [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2173.0s)]
*  on a show or a podcast and people, we have to do this thing now about, uh, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2178.4s)]
*  okay, he's not getting enough credit. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2184.6s)]
*  When will people start talking about? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2186.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2187.36s)]
*  See, first of all, I think people are talking about them. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2187.6s)]
*  And we did this on Sunday. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2190.0s)]
*  Um, I'm at the point with this, where if you're not taking okay, seeing Cleveland [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2192.36s)]
*  seriously as the two best teams in the league that have the two best chances to [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2197.96s)]
*  win the title, I just feel like you're not watching the season they're passing. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2202.32s)]
*  Cleveland's had two 15 game winning streaks. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2207.92s)]
*  I don't know what else they have to show us. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2210.88s)]
*  That team is awesome. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2213.32s)]
*  And Mitchell is having a great year. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2214.76s)]
*  And if like they play okay. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2216.6000000000004s)]
*  See in a series, he'll think he's as good as SGA. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2218.6000000000004s)]
*  Like to me, they check all the boxes and okay. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2221.56s)]
*  See now that Chet's back, that was one of, we're gonna talk to my dad, I think later, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2224.28s)]
*  but my dad came away, like he hadn't really seen a great check game in person. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2227.96s)]
*  Chet's been a fucking beast since he came back, you know, and I just think they can [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2232.96s)]
*  go small and big. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2239.04s)]
*  I think okay. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2240.04s)]
*  See is awesome. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2240.6800000000003s)]
*  I think beating them in a series is going to be really, really, really hard, especially [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2241.76s)]
*  with their good home team too. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2246.56s)]
*  They get a good crowd. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2248.36s)]
*  It's a weird place to play. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2249.7200000000003s)]
*  Their fans are like really rabid. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2251.32s)]
*  They affect the game. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2253.2400000000002s)]
*  They affect the refs. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2254.2000000000003s)]
*  And, uh, I don't know. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2255.28s)]
*  I just like, they're the favorite on Fandall for a reason. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2257.2000000000003s)]
*  They have the best team. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2259.96s)]
*  And they have a guy who can score on every team in the league whenever he wants. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2261.36s)]
*  That matters. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2265.04s)]
*  Dude, I'll remember it was Tim's last season. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2267.1200000000003s)]
*  I think I was at the Spurs and yeah, we had the playoff series up there and that [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2269.04s)]
*  place is insane. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2274.36s)]
*  It's a very difficult place. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2275.4s)]
*  It hurts your head. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2276.44s)]
*  That was my takeaway in the 2012 finals. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2278.0s)]
*  Like I actually had a headache after the home games. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2280.08s)]
*  It was like, this is too loud. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2282.52s)]
*  My head hurts. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2283.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2285.1200000000003s)]
*  Not to go full Spurs deja vu, but it was like that 2012 Spurs team was [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2285.28s)]
*  so great. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2290.56s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2291.48s)]
*  That the team didn't make the finals and OKC came back with Harden and [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2291.96s)]
*  Ibaka and took them out. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2296.32s)]
*  The Spurs were one. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2297.92s)]
*  Dude, I wrote the, I wrote the Grantland piece after the Spurs killed somebody [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2298.48s)]
*  about how this had a chance to be like a generational team. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2303.88s)]
*  And I think OKC swept them after I wrote the piece. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2306.88s)]
*  Like they were up 2-0. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2309.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2311.04s)]
*  They won game two, like by 30 at home in San Antonio and then didn't win the [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2311.24s)]
*  rest of the series. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2315.08s)]
*  That building is a very, very difficult place. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2316.12s)]
*  Well, especially when you're putting young and hungry guys in there. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2319.3199999999997s)]
*  And you know, look, you look at the game yesterday and you go back and watch [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2323.52s)]
*  the fourth quarter, which I did this morning, the Celts missed wide open [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2327.24s)]
*  shots, a bunch of them in the fourth quarter, whereas OKC actually made some [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2330.48s)]
*  shots and the big guy you have written behind you, I think, cause you want to [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2335.68s)]
*  remind yourself to talk about him was Wallace. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2339.72s)]
*  Wallace made the two dagger shots of the game and Wallace was awesome. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2341.56s)]
*  And Wallace is one of those guys. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2345.8s)]
*  Like I do the trade value list. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2347.76s)]
*  I was like, where does this guy go? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2349.88s)]
*  Cause there's no way they're trading him. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2351.32s)]
*  What's he worth? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2353.32s)]
*  Like he, if somebody's like, yeah, we'll do this. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  We'll give you this awesome player. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2357.5200000000004s)]
*  Give us back Wallace and some picks. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2358.76s)]
*  Presti is going to go, no thanks. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2360.5200000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2363.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm actually going to keep Wallace. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2363.6400000000003s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  Thank you though. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2365.0s)]
*  Thanks for your interest. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2365.5600000000004s)]
*  They can't pay all these guys. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2367.1200000000003s)]
*  And Wallace has written on my board because he, he deserves to be cause he [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2368.6000000000004s)]
*  played really well last night. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2372.56s)]
*  His daughter made those big shots. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  Made five of six great shot blocking guard like Derek White. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2376.2s)]
*  Uh, he loved that. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2382.12s)]
*  And just another great young two way player in Oklahoma city. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2383.72s)]
*  By the way, 21 years old, born on November, 2003, two years in, they have [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2387.2s)]
*  them at least for two more, you know, I SGA, I'm sure we'll work [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2396.44s)]
*  with them a tiny bit for salary stuff, but they're going to have to pay Chet. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2402.36s)]
*  And they're going to have to pay Wallace and they're going to have to play [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2407.92s)]
*  Jalen Williams on top of SGA. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2411.1600000000003s)]
*  That's going to be really hard. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2413.6800000000003s)]
*  Dort and yeah, like Wallace, Isaiah Joe, Isaiah Joe was so SGA took his rest [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2415.04s)]
*  at the beginning of the fourth last night and that Celtics were making noise. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2421.52s)]
*  And then he hit his own like killer three at the top of the arc. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2424.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2428.76s)]
*  The depth. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2429.04s)]
*  I think this has come up with a couple of the teams we really like out West. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2430.2000000000003s)]
*  Depth is going to be a real separator. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2433.04s)]
*  It gives you versatility. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2434.88s)]
*  It gives you sort of injury insurance and Oklahoma city has the biggest depth. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2436.04s)]
*  I think your team had the most depth in a way last year, um, just could play so, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2441.28s)]
*  so well this, this year, I think the thunder and the calves can match that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2446.96s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2452.04s)]
*  Well, the other thing is. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2454.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2455.96s)]
*  See has way better variables than the Celtics do. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2456.2799999999997s)]
*  If you're telling me I'm getting everybody for four rounds with the Celtics, I feel [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2460.64s)]
*  great, but I have Horford who's I think 39 who's still playing 28 minutes a game [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2464.6s)]
*  and they're still counting on him in a real way. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2471.24s)]
*  I have drew holiday is 34 has got a fucked up hand. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2473.72s)]
*  I have poor Zingas who I just have no idea when he's playing and when he's not [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2477.0s)]
*  playing at this point and it's like a pleasure to see him, but I don't trust [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2480.7599999999998s)]
*  that he's going to be out there a hundred percent of the time. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2484.72s)]
*  I have Pritchard who's hit or miss depending on the game in the matchup. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2487.16s)]
*  Um, whereas I got to look at it. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2491.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2493.3599999999997s)]
*  See, and it's like, it would really have something weird would have to happen [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2493.6s)]
*  for any of those guys to get hurt. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2496.68s)]
*  They're all young. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2498.0s)]
*  They're all, you know, same thing for Cleveland. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2498.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a mostly young team. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2501.7599999999998s)]
*  That's, you know, you'd have like Daris Garland got hurt last year [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2503.7599999999998s)]
*  because he broke his jaw, spit him in the head. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2506.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, but I just think the durability and consistency of those young guys, when [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2509.16s)]
*  you combine the hunger piece of it, it's, it's going to be a challenge for the [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2513.32s)]
*  Celtics. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2517.04s)]
*  This is going to be a way different journey for them this year. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2517.52s)]
*  Like even right now they're two seven. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2520.36s)]
*  They'll play the Hawks. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2522.76s)]
*  Let's say the Hawks are the seven seed. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2524.0s)]
*  They'll beat the Hawks. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2527.04s)]
*  That's not going to be like the most fun series. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2527.88s)]
*  Like the Hawks are, you know, they're, they're, they're not going to roll over. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2530.04s)]
*  Then they'll have the Knicks or Detroit in round two. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2534.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not going to be easy. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2537.92s)]
*  And then they play Cleveland or Milwaukee probably. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2539.92s)]
*  And that's before we get to the finals. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2543.0s)]
*  And I need all my guys to stay healthy the whole time. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2544.7599999999998s)]
*  Like it's, it's just going to be way harder. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2547.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2549.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, the, the, the Indiana conference finals last year, right? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2549.64s)]
*  That, you know, that this is going to be leveled up. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2552.68s)]
*  Um, so that could be every round. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2555.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2557.6s)]
*  And they won last year, which you can't sleep on. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2558.48s)]
*  Like it's so much harder to do it the second time. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2560.7599999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you this Detroit, New York, if you had to pick that series right now, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2563.2799999999997s)]
*  who are you taking? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2566.68s)]
*  I've listened. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2568.88s)]
*  So I watched the entire Knicks Portland game last night. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2569.3599999999997s)]
*  As my wife and I also watch, watch paradise. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2572.3199999999997s)]
*  So I had on the iPad watch going back kind of back to paradise is the perfect show. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2576.16s)]
*  You can watch while you're also doing something else. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2579.96s)]
*  Um, the Knicks have had, they pulled out some of these, some of these late ones. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2582.7599999999998s)]
*  And I kind of think they needed that game last night. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2589.0s)]
*  I thought Bridges really needed it. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2591.08s)]
*  Bridges had was threatening and just become like this appendage. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2592.6s)]
*  And, uh, I thought that was a really big game for them. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2597.64s)]
*  Towns hit a couple of huge threes down the stretch in the fourth quarter. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2600.0s)]
*  But, uh, I actually think these, this Brunson injury, which you never [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2603.72s)]
*  want anybody to get hurt, but I think it's a, it's a weirdly okay thing for them [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2607.44s)]
*  because now they have to use this different muscle. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2612.24s)]
*  I thought they were way too reliant on him. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2614.92s)]
*  And now it's like, Hey guys, McHale Bridges is a good offensive player. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2617.48s)]
*  Maybe you should give them the ball every once in a while. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2621.6s)]
*  Hey, Towns is a good matchup for the last two minutes of a game. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2623.6s)]
*  So I think they're going to figure some things out about the supporting [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2626.88s)]
*  cast that's going to help him when he comes back. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2629.7200000000003s)]
*  That's all good. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2633.4s)]
*  A good analysis. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2634.08s)]
*  What I see on my, my end of the efficiency landscape is over the last 15 [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2635.08s)]
*  games, Detroit has the second best net rating in the entire NBA. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2639.4s)]
*  I look at this constantly and I'm it's there, the one outlier where you're [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2643.04s)]
*  like, why is this team there? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2646.52s)]
*  It's because they have, you know, Cape Cunningham, Malik Beasley, Malik [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2648.6400000000003s)]
*  Beasley turning into Klay Thompson. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2653.36s)]
*  I don't think many of us predicted that, but he is averaging like 43% [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2654.96s)]
*  from three point range. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2659.64s)]
*  He's turning in 2016 Klay Thompson. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2660.92s)]
*  He's shooting almost 10 a game and he's making 43% of them. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2664.0s)]
*  It's one of the best catch and shoot seasons of all time. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2667.04s)]
*  And you know, they are playing great defense in a way that the Knicks are not. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2670.48s)]
*  I think they rebound. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2677.4s)]
*  The rebounding is the other thing. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2678.64s)]
*  They get second chances. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2679.92s)]
*  They control the boards. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2681.2400000000002s)]
*  They have size and they're nasty. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2683.0s)]
*  It's like a nasty team. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2685.28s)]
*  I wouldn't want to play him if I were the Knicks, but you know, we'll [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2687.96s)]
*  want to see what the Knicks get hold. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2691.2400000000002s)]
*  But anyway, I just thought throw that in there. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2692.4s)]
*  I like that every guy in the Pistons is ready to get in a fight. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2695.2s)]
*  Talked about it before, but I just, I love their attitude on everything. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2699.12s)]
*  And by the way, they have a realistic chance to get the four seed. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2702.44s)]
*  So we're taping this Thursday morning, Milwaukee is 36 and 28, Indiana is [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2707.04s)]
*  36 and 28, Detroit's 37 and 29. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2713.76s)]
*  And playing better net rating wise. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2714.2s)]
*  Name a stat from the last 25 games. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2717.52s)]
*  I'm going to look it up right now as we're talking, um, just last 25, this is nuts. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2720.9199999999996s)]
*  I have all these bookmarks for the net ratings and I have like 15, 25 and 20. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2726.0s)]
*  Detroit's 69 the last 25 and there's six defensive rating. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2733.2s)]
*  Do they, they have the second best day, as you mentioned. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2738.04s)]
*  Like that's a, that's not a small sample size. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2740.56s)]
*  25 games is fucking that's almost two, two months. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2743.0s)]
*  It's like seven weeks. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2747.56s)]
*  And they have a great offensive player. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2750.16s)]
*  And I know if you haven't gotten a chance to enjoy the Cade Cunningham breakout [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2752.24s)]
*  season, it's appointment. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2755.92s)]
*  It's beyond the breakout. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2757.4s)]
*  Would you vote for him for, for, uh, most improved, most improved. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2758.52s)]
*  Who are our candidates? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2764.48s)]
*  I'll give you them right now. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2766.2s)]
*  Do you have a vote? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2767.4s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2768.2s)]
*  No. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2768.92s)]
*  I do not have a vote. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2769.2s)]
*  I have a vote, so I'm not allowed to bet on this. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2770.08s)]
*  I always want to mention that. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2771.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2773.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2773.52s)]
*  Oh, he's the favorite minus two 70 is mobile in there. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  Dyson Daniels is plus two 20 mobiles, a hundred to one. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2778.2s)]
*  Now I will get the crazy one is Pritchard as the favorite for six [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2782.6s)]
*  man at minus two 40 Malik Beasley's plus 300, which tells me nobody's watching [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2786.2s)]
*  the Pistons because I would have thought Beasley should be the favorite at this [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2790.2s)]
*  point with how important he is. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2794.3199999999997s)]
*  And he's like, they're, you know, they're number two. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2795.52s)]
*  You know, their number two crunch time guy and I tied your room is down to 25 to one. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2798.44s)]
*  It used to be 55 to one. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2803.0800000000004s)]
*  I think he's in there too. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2804.4s)]
*  And then I guess Nas at 25 to one. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2806.1200000000003s)]
*  I, I don't really think of him as a bench guy because it feels like he starts so [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2808.2000000000003s)]
*  much and there's always somebody hurt, but he's in there too. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2812.0800000000004s)]
*  Who would you have? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2815.4s)]
*  Would you go Beasley? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2816.28s)]
*  No, I go Kade because I think it is the most significant. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2817.4s)]
*  Oh, for improved you go Kade. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2820.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2822.0400000000004s)]
*  What was the other, Oh, Beasley is six man. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2822.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2824.4s)]
*  I mean, as a nerd who loves catch and shoot stats, like this guy, this season is [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2824.76s)]
*  incredible. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  It's, it's, it's up there with the best catch and shoot seasons we've ever seen. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2829.88s)]
*  Well, you know, you know what, with the thing with Beasley that I noticed at the [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2834.6400000000003s)]
*  end of games when they're coming out of timeouts and the other team knows they're [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2837.8s)]
*  probably going to run a play with him coming around on a three and they're like [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2841.0s)]
*  treating him like he's Clay Thompson in 2016. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2844.6800000000003s)]
*  This is not, this is now like, Oh, this is a nice story. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2847.1600000000003s)]
*  We've we're well beyond that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  Teams are treating him like he's a real guy because he's been a real guy. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2851.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2854.56s)]
*  And what he brings to that team's offense that needs more offense is, um, is very [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2854.84s)]
*  important to their recent success. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  And Kade is a perfect distributor. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2862.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, I love what they're doing and they, they are not, I think you're right. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2865.36s)]
*  Milwaukee and Indiana sort of fading while they're scorching. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2869.12s)]
*  I don't think they'll end up as a sixth seed, which should be good news for, for [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2872.36s)]
*  next fans. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2875.4s)]
*  There's just no good stats with Milwaukee. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2876.4s)]
*  Like last 25, they're 12th. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2880.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2884.24s)]
*  Last 20, they're 16th. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2885.72s)]
*  And then you go, if we do, yeah, well, last 15, same thing. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2893.04s)]
*  They are. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2900.2s)]
*  They are Jesus. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2904.52s)]
*  Oh, night. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2907.84s)]
*  That's not bad for last 15. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2908.36s)]
*  So there's signs of life, I guess. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2910.24s)]
*  Um, but last, but Detroit's played better for them for seven weeks is I guess the, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2911.9199999999996s)]
*  uh, the big point. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2916.52s)]

*  All right. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2958.72s)]
*  So when I was in Austin, Texas last month for a live show, we went to your sports [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2959.04s)]
*  business class at the university of Texas in Austin. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2963.7999999999997s)]
*  Had a bunch of really smart people, um, who had been working for a while on a big [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2969.8s)]
*  project. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2975.28s)]
*  So you explained what the project was. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2975.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2977.88s)]
*  Like, so when the semester began, I'll take you back to January of 2025 and, and [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2978.12s)]
*  you and Rosilla and a bunch of people were doing, um, check-ins on the NBA vibe. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2982.2400000000002s)]
*  And at that time, the story was ratings are way down. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2987.28s)]
*  Um, and so we designed a case around what's going on with the NBA and what [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2990.6800000000003s)]
*  would you do to change it? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2996.52s)]
*  And we had a bunch of students, like 40 or 50 students, and we'd work with [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=2998.4s)]
*  Fandool. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3001.76s)]
*  They'd send us some of their handle data, which was really interesting. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3002.32s)]
*  So to go beyond just TV ratings and look at betting handle as a proxy for interest [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3005.08s)]
*  in the league as a sort of a lie betting and the, yeah, all that stuff. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3011.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3015.84s)]
*  Cause the theory is like, whether you gamble or not, I think we would all admit [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3016.12s)]
*  if there are more bets on a game, that probably means more people are paying [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3019.76s)]
*  attention to it. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3023.36s)]
*  It might not just be on the background. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3024.12s)]
*  People are actually paying attention to it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3025.4s)]
*  And, you know, the, the, the key thing we found right away is that it is a good [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3027.36s)]
*  proxy for interest. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3031.2s)]
*  It may mix a lot of the TV ratings stuff we saw early in the season, which sort [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3032.24s)]
*  of troughed in December and rebounded with that famous Christmas night game, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3036.68s)]
*  um, between the Lakers and Warriors. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3042.2s)]
*  Uh, and now we're slightly down year over year, but I had the students like, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3044.92s)]
*  Hey, what would you do? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3047.72s)]
*  Uh, what would you recommend to the commissioner of the NBA to improve, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3049.0s)]
*  um, the popularity of our broadcasts and the, in the overall league itself. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3053.1600000000003s)]
*  So right now the season is 82 games. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3059.76s)]
*  It starts on October 22nd this year. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3063.36s)]
*  It ended on April 13th. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3065.84s)]
*  It's 24 weeks, 82 games. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3067.5600000000004s)]
*  The plan is the mid April. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3069.7200000000003s)]
*  First three rounds of the playoffs this year starts April 19th. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3071.96s)]
*  Ends June 2nd. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3075.76s)]
*  So it's seven plus weeks for those three rounds and the final starts June 5th. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3076.96s)]
*  And ends June 22nd. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3083.44s)]
*  And your students decided what? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3086.4s)]
*  Got to start later. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3088.92s)]
*  Move the start 45 days later in the calendar. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3089.84s)]
*  Another opening day is in December. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3094.0s)]
*  Uh, you still get that Christmas slate. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3096.28s)]
*  Um, and you go into July bill and this is really for one main reason. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3098.52s)]
*  Um, which is to get away from the monster that is football, specifically [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3104.48s)]
*  NFL and college football, which hogs all of our attention. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3110.2799999999997s)]
*  It hogs my attention in the fall. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3114.16s)]
*  It hogs your attention. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3116.0s)]
*  Um, and we think that there's a compelling case for the NBA to consider moving out [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3117.4799999999996s)]
*  from under that boot of the football attention, uh, and then an intention [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3123.7599999999998s)]
*  economy, I think if you play more of your games in January, February, March, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3128.56s)]
*  April, May, June, July, there's a much better chance for better television [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3134.4799999999996s)]
*  audiences, uh, and other sort of signs of interest. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3138.88s)]
*  So two things with that. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3143.44s)]
*  They're launching the season, October 22nd. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3145.12s)]
*  They're going against the world series. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3147.6s)]
*  They're going against the, the NFL season has really kicked into gear. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3150.6800000000003s)]
*  All the teams are starting to play better. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3155.48s)]
*  It's like the height of college football. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3156.96s)]
*  The presidential election. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3159.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3161.52s)]
*  Every four years of presidential election is coming. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3162.04s)]
*  Um, and they're just popping right in the middle of that. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3164.8s)]
*  And people are like, cool. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3167.68s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3168.56s)]
*  They're going the way they have it structured now. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3169.56s)]
*  They're basically going against the NFL for the first 11 weeks of the NBA season. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3172.92s)]
*  So it's, it's like 45% of the season. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3177.7999999999997s)]
*  They're just going head to head against NFL. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3180.12s)]
*  Now the playoffs, there's less games. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3181.68s)]
*  Eventually they have the, I talked about how stupid this was a couple weeks ago. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3183.12s)]
*  NFL and Superbowl ends the NFL. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3188.12s)]
*  The NBA has already done their trade deadlines. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3190.68s)]
*  So they lose that whole bump from whenever that happens. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3192.2799999999997s)]
*  And then they go right to the all star break. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3195.8799999999997s)]
*  And what happens during the all star break? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3197.56s)]
*  There's no basketball and everybody's complaining about how bad all star weekend is. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3199.0s)]
*  So that's, that's your first arrival. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3202.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3205.0s)]
*  And then what always happens is we hit the end of February and there's good [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3205.16s)]
*  basketball games and people are like, Whoa, the NBA has got really good. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3209.0s)]
*  It's like, now the NBA was really good. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3212.88s)]
*  Actually, you just, you, you were concentrated on the football. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3214.88s)]
*  So I was like in 45 days seemed like a lot to me. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3217.96s)]
*  And I did all these different, I sketched it out a bunch of different ways. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3221.8s)]
*  And I think 45 days is around the right number. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3226.32s)]
*  So the first thing I did was 42. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3229.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you move everything 42 days, that's six weeks. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3232.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3236.32s)]
*  That starts the season on December 3rd, the week after Thanksgiving, at least [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3237.92s)]
*  that that's what would have happened this year. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3242.2000000000003s)]
*  You start December 3rd, 24 weeks ends May 25th. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3243.5600000000004s)]
*  Play in May 27th to May 30th. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3250.0800000000004s)]
*  First three rounds, May 31st ends July 21st. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3253.0s)]
*  And then the finals go July 24th ends August 10th. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3257.7999999999997s)]
*  That seems too late to me. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3263.12s)]
*  I love second to me, the goal should be, how do we get away from [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3265.4399999999996s)]
*  football as much as possible? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3270.56s)]
*  How do we take advantage of all of June instead of having the finals end on [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3272.3599999999997s)]
*  like June 18th, June 19th, why are we throwing away June and then could [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3276.24s)]
*  July really work for us? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3280.68s)]
*  And I think we both agree it could. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3282.68s)]
*  And your students, I mean, talk about the case they made for July. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3285.04s)]
*  Yeah, July traditionally, and we had, we were lucky enough, Bob Iger came to our [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3289.7999999999997s)]
*  class a couple of weeks before and said, there's a metric called HUT's households [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3293.9199999999996s)]
*  using television that traditionally says July is a no fly zone on television. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3298.0s)]
*  Like that's why there's no new shows. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3302.52s)]
*  But with streaming and the changing landscape of media consumption, even [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3304.96s)]
*  he was saying, this is no longer the case. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3309.6s)]
*  Like July is open for business. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3312.2s)]
*  There's there's streamers that are launching huge shows during the summer. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3314.44s)]
*  Now I think it's a little bit antiquated to say that there's no business case [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3318.2s)]
*  for playing high level basketball. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3323.6s)]
*  It's a lot antiquated. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3324.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3326.08s)]
*  I don't think this shit matters anymore. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3326.2799999999997s)]
*  The whole model of like TV goes from September to May and we have three [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3328.16s)]
*  networks and we release stuff and we have sweeps and like, that's fucking out. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3333.0s)]
*  Shows can hit any time of the year. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3337.2s)]
*  And if you're on vacation, you have, you bring your cable package with you. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3339.12s)]
*  All of us are bringing Hulu or YouTube TV or whatever it is with us, wherever we're going. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3342.56s)]
*  I do think it is a fair criticism, Bill, to say that the NBA finals being in July [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3347.48s)]
*  would be annoying to a lot of the key stakeholders, whether those are the [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3353.32s)]
*  players, the coaches, the executives, the people running the buildings, people in [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3356.56s)]
*  Phoenix or Los Angeles might not want to be in town in July, those kinds of [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3364.32s)]
*  thoughts are relevant here. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3368.64s)]
*  Um, but ultimately I think there is a strong business case to be made that we [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3370.44s)]
*  could play the playoffs in the finals later in the spring than we currently do. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3375.8799999999997s)]
*  That's where I landed. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3381.24s)]
*  That's where the students landed. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3382.16s)]
*  Um, and I think it's, it's compelling enough. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3384.08s)]
*  The league should consider it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3387.12s)]
*  Well, so there's two big things. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3388.92s)]
*  One, the number of weeks you could just get away from football is just [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3390.2s)]
*  the 100% positive. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3394.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3395.8399999999997s)]
*  Like you're not equal to football. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3396.8799999999997s)]
*  You're not going to be, it's a way bigger audience. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3399.12s)]
*  You don't have the gambling fantasy stuff that football has. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3402.04s)]
*  You don't have the ability for everybody to mobilize around Sundays. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3405.08s)]
*  And football is getting better and better at doing their own schedule. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3408.2s)]
*  They're better at, oh, here's a Friday game. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3411.6s)]
*  Oh, now we're going to have two Christmas games. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3414.52s)]
*  Oh, now we're going to tackle Saturdays. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3416.72s)]
*  Like football is just going to get better and better at killing the NBA during these [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3419.0s)]
*  first two months. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3422.7599999999998s)]
*  So the more you can get away from that, the better. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3423.9599999999996s)]
*  And then I just feel like for the NBA, April, May, June, July should be the peak [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3426.6s)]
*  months and all of July. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3431.64s)]
*  So one of the things I was looking at, if you moved everything 42 days, but you [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3434.0s)]
*  had a 76 game regular season. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3438.7999999999997s)]
*  So everybody loses three home games, three away games. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3440.8799999999997s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3443.24s)]
*  You guys just signed a $76 billion deal. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3443.7599999999998s)]
*  You'll be fine. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3446.3599999999997s)]
*  Um, that would start the season on December 3rd, but ended on May 11th, 22 [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3447.6s)]
*  weeks, 76 games play in May 13th to May 16th. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3453.12s)]
*  First three rounds, May 17th to July 7th. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3458.16s)]
*  Now we're talking finals July 10th to July 27th. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3461.64s)]
*  And now all we've done is we've, we've targeted basically post NFL draft. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3467.56s)]
*  Our three best months of the season. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3474.24s)]
*  We don't have to worry about the NFL at all. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3476.88s)]
*  It's out. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3478.7599999999998s)]
*  And the only thing we'd have to worry about is like the freaking Olympics, but [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3479.72s)]
*  I don't think the NBA player should send our guys to the Olympics anyway. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3483.12s)]
*  So we're fine. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3486.56s)]
*  Um, with that, so I've asked NBA people about this in the past and they said the [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3487.7599999999998s)]
*  biggest reason they wouldn't move it is because of the summer schedule, because [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3493.04s)]
*  we need our summers. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3497.44s)]
*  It's the two months off. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3498.52s)]
*  Our kids are home from school, whatever counter, um, you'd still have August. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3499.6s)]
*  During July, you're working anyway with the Vegas summer league. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3508.64s)]
*  That's become like a, almost a two week event. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3511.68s)]
*  Um, I would get rid of Vegas summer league completely and use that so that [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3514.84s)]
*  we're done July 27th, the draft is July 31st, tone down summer league. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3519.72s)]
*  Don't make it this huge thing. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3525.16s)]
*  And then you basically get August and September and half of October off [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3527.2s)]
*  before we get the pre- that makes way more sense to me. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3531.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3535.04s)]
*  I think it would make way more money too. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3535.6s)]
*  And there's a one word that hasn't come up, which explains why it isn't like [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3537.7599999999998s)]
*  this already and that's baseball. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3541.16s)]
*  When the NBA started avoiding baseball on the calendar was that, that era's [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3543.92s)]
*  version of avoiding football now. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3549.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3551.16s)]
*  You know, Mickey Mantle and the Yankees, we can't compete with that. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3551.3999999999996s)]
*  Like let's, let's start our season right after the world series. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3554.48s)]
*  Like that's, that was the logic. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3558.2s)]
*  This is now an updated version of that where Mickey Mantle and the Yankees [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3559.7999999999997s)]
*  is now Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3563.3999999999996s)]
*  Good point. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3566.3199999999997s)]
*  And one further point, what did Disney just do this week or last couple of weeks [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3567.08s)]
*  is get off of their baseball relationship. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3572.68s)]
*  That's one of the major media partners and they need inventory later [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3575.04s)]
*  into the spring and summer. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3579.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3580.72s)]
*  There's no Sunday night baseball anymore. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3580.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, let's put, you know, the first round of the playoffs into April, May, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3582.68s)]
*  June, and give them more summertime content for those, those key moments. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3586.96s)]
*  Cause they're also strapped down with football for the entire fall too. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3593.56s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of compelling reasons to think about this from a media [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3598.56s)]
*  perspective and as a league that's trying to gain more eyeballs and revenue in an [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3602.28s)]
*  attention economy that's increasingly competitive and increasingly in the sports [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3608.68s)]
*  world dominated by both pro football and high level college football in the fall. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3613.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3618.72s)]
*  If you're being smart about this, everything moving later also means the [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3618.88s)]
*  trade deadline is after the NFL season. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3624.6800000000003s)]
*  Your all-star break and all-star game. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3627.6800000000003s)]
*  If you have one now that's moving to mid March, maybe even during March madness. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3629.76s)]
*  Maybe you just don't have an all-star game anymore and you just have. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3634.6400000000003s)]
*  All-star break is March madness. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3640.04s)]
*  I still love Chris Ryan's idea of having all-star break actually just be bi-weeks [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3641.8s)]
*  with 10 team bi-weeks, three weeks in a row, or each set of 10 teams gets one week [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3647.44s)]
*  off and I would get rid of the all-star game. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3652.32s)]
*  I don't think it works that they want to have some sort of big corporate event. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3654.32s)]
*  Make that the NBA cup whenever you have that. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3658.32s)]
*  Um, but the big thing to me that we know we're right is because some of the stuff [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3661.12s)]
*  that they're already doing is a reaction to the fact that football is just killing [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3666.4s)]
*  them, right? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3670.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3672.28s)]
*  Moving the TNT Barkley show from Thursdays to Tuesdays during the NFL season is a [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3672.64s)]
*  direct concession that you're getting destroyed on Thursday nights. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3679.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3682.56s)]
*  Just period. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3682.88s)]
*  Doing this NBA cup thing is a direct concession that nobody gives a shit about [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3684.8s)]
*  the NBA in late October, November and December. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3689.32s)]
*  And you need to do something to be like, Hey, we're over here. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3692.2s)]
*  They just need to move it. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3695.96s)]
*  And here's the other thing, Kurt Goldsberry. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3697.12s)]
*  We know expansions come in 32 teams. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3699.56s)]
*  If there's ever a time to go to a 69 game schedule, it's when they do these expansion [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3702.8s)]
*  teams because 32 games, you play the other 31 teams twice, right? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3707.4s)]
*  You have four, 18 conference, 18 divisions. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3714.36s)]
*  So you play everybody twice and you play everyone in your vision one more time. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3718.64s)]
*  And it's 69 games total. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3722.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3724.48s)]
*  So let's start the season, December 10th. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3724.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's end at May 4th. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3728.0s)]
*  Let's play a 20 week season. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3730.44s)]
*  Let's start the play in May 6th and May 9th. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3732.2s)]
*  Let's play the first three rounds, May 10th to June 30th. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3734.3599999999997s)]
*  And let's start the finals, July 3rd and on July 20th with a 69 game schedule. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3736.96s)]
*  There's no fucking way you can tell me that's not going to be better for the NBA. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3742.12s)]
*  If attention is good, then that's better. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3746.3999999999996s)]
*  And I think the other thing you mentioned in there is like make the NBA cup, the [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3748.96s)]
*  all star game right after the Superbowl. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3752.16s)]
*  That's our welcome back to the NBA moment for football. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3754.16s)]
*  It's a, it's such a great format. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3757.64s)]
*  Shout out to the NBA for adding that. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3759.7599999999998s)]
*  It really makes those, those meaningful one game events that the NFL has [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3762.3199999999997s)]
*  taught us are so great. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3767.4399999999996s)]
*  Um, but the NBA cup is a winning addition to the calendar. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3769.08s)]
*  Uh, and I think you're right. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3773.04s)]
*  I think we could survive in July. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3774.2s)]
*  I don't know about summer league in August. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3777.08s)]
*  That's a, that's a tricky part. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3778.9199999999996s)]
*  There will be people who are annoyed. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3780.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, but I think for the, don't make it as big of a thing as it was and just make it [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3782.2799999999997s)]
*  like, I thought that if you're going to do a counter on this, the hardest thing to [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3786.2799999999997s)]
*  figure out as the college season ends, kids graduate, but you wouldn't be able [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3790.32s)]
*  to have the draft until July and end of July. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3794.04s)]
*  So none of those kids would know where they're playing, who they're working [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3796.96s)]
*  out for, for an extra six weeks. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3799.48s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3803.56s)]
*  Maybe you have the draft between the regular season and playoffs. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3804.84s)]
*  I don't know, but that's the only part I can figure out. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3808.44s)]
*  Well, so the, let's say, you know, early April college season ends, you know, if [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3812.4s)]
*  we're not starting until December, who cares if the draft is, is not till the [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3817.44s)]
*  August or whatever. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3821.68s)]
*  I think that's fine. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3822.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3823.76s)]
*  Those kids are all working out on themselves. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3824.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3825.68s)]
*  Screw the rookies. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3826.12s)]
*  So just, I'm going to go through this one more time. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3828.12s)]
*  69 game regular season. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3832.16s)]
*  Once we have 32 teams starts December 10th, ends May 4th. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3833.92s)]
*  We could even say, we'll give everyone an extra week. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3837.56s)]
*  We'll start May 11th, but let's say May 4th. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3840.16s)]
*  The playoffs are done. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3842.7200000000003s)]
*  First three rounds on June 30th finals goes July 3rd, right before July 4th, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3844.0s)]
*  which would be cool, um, through July 20th. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3848.88s)]
*  And we're done on July 20th. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3852.08s)]
*  So we basically, if you shorten the season and then move it and it's a month [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3853.4s)]
*  longer, and now I'm concentrating all my best stuff in May, June, July, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3858.44s)]
*  that's how you win. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3862.08s)]
*  And this is how they have to think. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3863.36s)]
*  And if they don't start thinking this way, I'm going to really start thinking [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3864.6800000000003s)]
*  that they need the leadership at the top. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3867.2400000000002s)]
*  I know they got this giant media deal, but these are easy fixes that they [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3869.0s)]
*  should do. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3873.68s)]
*  Well, and the other thing that I think is starting to percolate out, there's [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3875.12s)]
*  this rumor of alternate leagues coming around and I think that it's not a [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3878.0s)]
*  rumor anymore. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3882.24s)]
*  It's not a rumor anymore. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3883.2799999999997s)]
*  And I wonder, you know, in an era where live golf came in and the Saudi [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3884.64s)]
*  soccer thing came in, if the league keeps jamming us up with 82 games and making [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3889.52s)]
*  it such a slog, if they don't show some concession to the athletes or the players, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3896.48s)]
*  are they making these rival league potentials more attractive to some of [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3903.28s)]
*  their talent around? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3907.72s)]
*  And you can call me crazy all you want. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3909.6s)]
*  I'm not saying if you follow soccer or golf, you've just seen this. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3911.28s)]
*  Those things weren't going to be real until they were. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3915.7599999999998s)]
*  I think there's a real chance. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3918.92s)]
*  The NBA needs to be proactive here. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3920.68s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3922.24s)]
*  Keep being proactive. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3923.6s)]
*  Don't be reactive here. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3925.16s)]
*  There's a chance to make the NBA better. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3926.8s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers, I think it was Laker Celtics biggest broadcast [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3928.6s)]
*  of the year, perfect. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3931.88s)]
*  When did that happen? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3933.28s)]
*  After the NFL. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3934.44s)]
*  If you put that game on a wild card Saturday, you're done. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3935.88s)]
*  Nobody watches that. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3940.92s)]
*  And you put it instead in March and here we have 5 million people watching [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3942.2000000000003s)]
*  it on American television. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3946.36s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3948.36s)]
*  That's the kind of incremental improvement we could ramp up across the, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3949.4s)]
*  across the business. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3954.32s)]
*  If we got out of the way of football. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3956.04s)]
*  Well, one of the cool things that your students did, I mean, there's [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3959.2400000000002s)]
*  all this anecdotal evidence we have anyway, that football is just [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3961.7999999999997s)]
*  destroying everyone else. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3964.64s)]
*  And then it's an absolute monster. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3965.64s)]
*  But then the college football piece, not just NFL where college football really [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3967.8399999999997s)]
*  crest from the end of August, mid November, probably. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3972.4s)]
*  And then we start getting it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3977.44s)]
*  So it's probably mid November range. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3978.64s)]
*  So you're going against two monoliths every weekend. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3980.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3983.8399999999997s)]
*  I just don't know why you would do that if you don't have to. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3984.68s)]
*  The only thing, my big takeaway is, and I didn't really think about it [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3988.36s)]
*  until I was in your class. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3991.96s)]
*  It makes zero sense to start on October 22nd, October 23rd, anywhere in October. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3993.8s)]
*  It's stupid. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3998.76s)]
*  They shouldn't do it anymore. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=3999.84s)]
*  And if they're going to move, if they want to move it to mid November, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4001.36s)]
*  even that makes more sense. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4004.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4005.88s)]
*  But first week of December makes the most sense and they just have to start [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4006.8s)]
*  thinking that way. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4010.44s)]
*  And I really think like, if you're just trying to get like basketball, NBA, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4011.2400000000002s)]
*  Nirvana for how a season should go. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4015.16s)]
*  It should be 69 games. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4017.7999999999997s)]
*  It should start in December and it should end in July and they're going to win. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4019.6s)]
*  If they do that. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4022.7599999999998s)]
*  One. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4023.72s)]
*  So one of the people at the NBA told me is like, you know, we came up with the [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4024.2s)]
*  NBA cup as a way to sort of help the owners compensate for a loss of regular [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4027.2799999999997s)]
*  season inventory. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4032.2s)]
*  And when confronted with the idea, Hey, let's go down to 70 games or 74 games. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4033.92s)]
*  We're going to add this in season property to compensate for that. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4038.4s)]
*  We'll sell it to a media partner. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4042.2s)]
*  The owners of course came back with, well, why don't we do 82 games and the [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4043.8399999999997s)]
*  end season tournament and not lose any money. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4047.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think somebody needs to do a better job of convincing owners and players [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4050.56s)]
*  that somehow we're going to make the same amount of total revenue. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4055.44s)]
*  If we drop the games to 70, 69, whatever we decide. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4059.2799999999997s)]
*  Cause right now that's the case that has failed to make it across the table and [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4063.7599999999998s)]
*  land with the owners. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4068.68s)]
*  And that's the simple reason why we still have 82 games. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4069.7599999999998s)]
*  Hey, I have a question. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4073.0s)]
*  How much fucking revenue do you need? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4074.08s)]
*  We're going to have guys making $75 billion a year. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4076.68s)]
*  Like how much is, how much is enough? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4079.48s)]
*  You just signed a $76 billion deal. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4081.8399999999997s)]
*  Like do what's best for the sport, try to grow the sport. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4083.8399999999997s)]
*  And this is the best way to do it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4087.4s)]
*  You mentioned the alternative league. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4089.0s)]
*  So it's, it's being pushed by a maverick Carter, who's LeBron, one of his business [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4091.2799999999997s)]
*  guys. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4095.72s)]
*  And when I heard about it, I thought it was, I just thought it was bullshit [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4096.0s)]
*  because I didn't think it was real because I thought initially everyone thought those [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4100.68s)]
*  guys were getting the Vegas team. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4105.8s)]
*  And then I, I don't, I think it's wide open. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4108.12s)]
*  I don't think they have any inside track at all. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4111.0s)]
*  And in fact, there's other groups that I would bet on before them. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4112.88s)]
*  And I thought this was a ploy by them to pretend they're doing raising [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4116.12s)]
*  Saudi money and blah, blah, blah. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4120.280000000001s)]
*  And ultimately, all right, we'll drop it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4121.88s)]
*  If we get the Vegas team, that's not the case. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4123.56s)]
*  They have got a shitload of money for this and a plan. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4126.04s)]
*  And everything I've heard is that it's kind of real. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4130.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if they have all the money yet, but they have enough that could you, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4134.320000000001s)]
*  could you form a six team league and convince five, six, seven stars to basically [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4137.88s)]
*  jump when their contracts, I think the contracts would have to be over. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4143.92s)]
*  But I look at Luca, he's down in 26. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4147.160000000001s)]
*  Like that's somebody like, all right, if he's, could this be a live situation? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4150.56s)]
*  What does he carry? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4154.04s)]
*  Does that mean loyalty to the NBA? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4154.68s)]
*  He just got traded. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4156.04s)]
*  So like, could you pay, could you build a league and have like six, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4157.28s)]
*  seven Luca type guys, Hey, Luca, here's a hundred million dollars a year. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4160.2s)]
*  You're playing a 35 game season and, uh, and you're going to be the face, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4164.0s)]
*  one of the faces of this league. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4168.56s)]
*  Like, I think it's real. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4169.56s)]
*  And I think the NBA owners are a little more worried about it than I [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4171.08s)]
*  think has been reported so far. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4174.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4175.92s)]
*  Imagine a world where you get paid more money to play less basketball and travel [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4176.16s)]
*  around the world, way less basketball, right? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4180.8s)]
*  Imagine a world where you're paid more money to play less basketball, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4183.5599999999995s)]
*  travel around the world. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4187.0s)]
*  You get to live. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4188.599999999999s)]
*  If you're Luca, I'm not, I haven't heard anything, but if you're Luca, you can [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4189.719999999999s)]
*  live in Slovenia and make these flights to Singapore or Manila or Shanghai to [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4192.799999999999s)]
*  play in this touring style, um, F one almost structured basketball league. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4198.12s)]
*  Again, anybody who's followed soccer or golf knows this could happen. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4204.36s)]
*  This can happen. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4209.32s)]
*  So to sit here and say, this is, this is, this is impossible is to be naive. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4211.32s)]
*  Um, and it's also that we're in a world right now where rich people [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4217.72s)]
*  throw money at sports stuff. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4222.88s)]
*  It's just a fact. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4224.48s)]
*  We're in a world now where the Saudis and everybody on that side of the world is [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4225.8s)]
*  pumping incredible amounts of money in a UFC and the WWE and boxing. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4229.64s)]
*  Like they, they've completely transformed boxing to think that they [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4235.64s)]
*  couldn't decide to just do that with basketball is nuts. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4239.12s)]
*  It's naive. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4242.16s)]
*  Basketball is legitimately a global sport. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4243.44s)]
*  Now in the NBA, it is a global league to its credit. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4245.16s)]
*  I got to go to Paris and watch NBA games, but that was two games on the continent [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4248.12s)]
*  of Europe all year long. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4252.36s)]
*  Um, people in the Philippines would kill to see this level of basketball. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4254.08s)]
*  People in China, people in Europe, uh, people in Africa, Australia, this is [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4258.24s)]
*  truly a global game, unlike baseball or football. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4264.12s)]
*  Uh, and so I think that makes it even more attractive to somebody to come [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4267.599999999999s)]
*  through and try to disrupt it, uh, because you know what, Memphis and Cleveland, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4270.92s)]
*  those are cool cities, but so are Singapore and Shanghai. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4275.4s)]
*  Um, and there's real money around there. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4279.4s)]
*  You mentioned that it's a global game. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4282.0s)]
*  They also have players that I think unlike, unlike with some of the golfers, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4283.719999999999s)]
*  you have players that have huge social media footprints that if they switch [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4288.48s)]
*  leagues or went or did something else, they'd actually be able to promote [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4293.24s)]
*  themselves, you know, and it's like, I remember when, uh, when my contract [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4296.72s)]
*  was almost up with ESPN and it seemed like people thought I was going to leave [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4301.08s)]
*  and they were writing about it. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4305.320000000001s)]
*  It's like, well, you can't leave ESPN. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4306.12s)]
*  Can't leave the machine. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4307.8s)]
*  It's like, guess what? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4308.8s)]
*  And then all of these people over the next 10 years, including myself, were [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4310.0s)]
*  able to leave and start stuff. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4313.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like, you don't need the fucking machine. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4314.8s)]
*  I don't think the basketball players need the machine. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4316.8s)]
*  I think if they were part of another league, I think, I think people [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4319.280000000001s)]
*  would pay attention to it. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4322.240000000001s)]
*  Dude, down here in Texas, there's like more than one of my friends, multiple [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4323.5599999999995s)]
*  friends, Mavericks fan friends that are not joking when they say I'm rooting [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4327.639999999999s)]
*  for the Lakers this year. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4331.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4333.08s)]
*  Like maybe these brands aren't as strong as we think they are in the, in the, uh, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4333.32s)]
*  social media era where you say, oh, look at Don, kids is on. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4338.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4341.88s)]
*  Oh, I'm a look at Don. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4342.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4343.96s)]
*  Shout out to Jason Gallagher's kid again. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4344.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, like that's the future. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4346.76s)]
*  I'm just, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4348.639999999999s)]
*  just repeated mentions of the pod. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4350.04s)]
*  You're right though. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4352.88s)]
*  They're just going to follow. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4353.5599999999995s)]
*  They'll follow him there and guess what? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4354.639999999999s)]
*  They'll probably follow him too. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4355.96s)]
*  When he's playing for the Singapore giants, that's what soccer's taught us, dude. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4357.24s)]
*  I mean, that's exactly how these kids follow soccer. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4361.8s)]
*  They're Ronaldo or they're Messi or they're Mbappe and they're going with them [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4364.88s)]
*  wherever that's going. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4368.4s)]
*  Why wouldn't that happen to these athletes that are just as popular? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4369.36s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you this. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4373.28s)]
*  The NBA has to start taking all this shit seriously. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4374.5199999999995s)]
*  They're throwing away the first two months of the season every year. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4376.84s)]
*  The season's too long. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4379.320000000001s)]
*  Nobody likes it. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4380.8s)]
*  The players don't like it. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4381.72s)]
*  There's all these solutions that they're unwilling to explore. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4383.24s)]
*  They're going to add two teams and somehow keep an 82 game schedule, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4386.320000000001s)]
*  which is stupid. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4389.52s)]
*  And they have all this money that they already got that allows them now the [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4391.24s)]
*  luxury to rethink this whole system. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4395.8s)]
*  And that's how they should be thinking. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4398.08s)]
*  And if they're not thinking that way, they need new people to run the league. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4399.320000000001s)]
*  And one last, one last point about the 82 games. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4402.08s)]
*  It's more than just too much inventory. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4404.8s)]
*  Load management. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4407.04s)]
*  If you look at the data load management really annoys fans. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4408.2s)]
*  People don't want to turn on TNT like we did for that Celtics Sixers game the [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4411.360000000001s)]
*  other night and see the main red claws in the Delta where Delaware 87ers. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4415.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4419.2s)]
*  One of the reasons that happens is we're, we're, we're putting too many games out [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4420.68s)]
*  there. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4424.52s)]
*  If we had fewer games, there'd be fewer load management situations. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4424.8s)]
*  We would have full, full teams playing each other. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4429.2s)]
*  The product would be better on average. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4432.360000000001s)]
*  Well, you'd also have a situation like Philly is now punted on their season. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4435.599999999999s)]
*  You don't have to watch the zombie Sixers for the next two months, not give a shit. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4439.48s)]
*  Like, all right, we're out way sooner, you know, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4444.08s)]
*  simulation mode. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4446.599999999999s)]
*  You can enter. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4447.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4448.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4448.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I think that's a big thing, but I think the shorter season where games [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4448.92s)]
*  feel more like events, it takes a little blind faith to see that that could get [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4452.88s)]
*  you to more revenue. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4457.599999999999s)]
*  But I love your point about, Hey, well, you just locked up this huge media rights [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4458.48s)]
*  deal. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4462.48s)]
*  Do you really need a lot? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4462.719999999999s)]
*  Every people are paying the most money they've ever paid for your teams. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4464.5599999999995s)]
*  Like this is a time now to be proactive and try to get better at stuff. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4468.04s)]
*  And that this is going to require real vision. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4472.68s)]
*  And it's not just like, we've come up with the NBA cup. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4474.92s)]
*  We've added a new event to all star weekend on Saturdays. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4477.68s)]
*  Like we're not talking about that. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4480.5199999999995s)]
*  Like you have a chance to actually fix shit. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4482.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4484.2s)]
*  Kurt Goldsberry was fun to sit in your class. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4484.44s)]
*  Shout out to your students. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4486.76s)]
*  That was a great presentation. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4487.88s)]
*  Uh, I will see you soon. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4489.5199999999995s)]
*  Say hi to everybody in Austin. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4490.64s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4491.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4492.599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4493.28s)]
*  My dad is here, um, complaining to me all during the OKC Celtic game. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4493.4800000000005s)]
*  It's been a tumultuous year for him. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4497.84s)]
*  He just adopted a new puppy, um, lost sadly lost Sally a couple of months ago. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4499.72s)]
*  Uh, you thought you were going to be a one dog family. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4506.36s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're telling me you're getting a puppy. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4508.8s)]
*  Ruby is the name. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4511.96s)]
*  And, uh, and now you're up with a puppy that's peeing on pads and scratching [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4513.52s)]
*  you and biting you. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4518.12s)]
*  And was it worth it? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4518.88s)]
*  I guess is my question. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4519.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4521.8s)]
*  I think, um, I'm just watching it cause she's been peeing on the floor all morning. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4523.32s)]
*  Oh, good. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4529.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4530.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4531.96s)]
*  She actually last night was good. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4532.24s)]
*  She got up at two o'clock. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4534.64s)]
*  She did her business, went back to bed, woke me up at seven 30. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4536.52s)]
*  She's only 10 weeks old. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4541.4800000000005s)]
*  Sounds great. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4543.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4544.16s)]
*  I mean, like you said, Molly, my wife, Molly can bring the puppy when she's 10 [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4544.8s)]
*  years old to the nursing home to visit. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4551.2s)]
*  It's going to work out great. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4553.5599999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4555.88s)]
*  Good. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4556.5599999999995s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4556.84s)]
*  So you, you went to the Celtic game last night and you hadn't seen this version of [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4557.96s)]
*  okay, seeing in person, um, what was your take, what was your in-person [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4563.12s)]
*  takeaway of the thunder? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4567.08s)]
*  A couple of things. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4569.639999999999s)]
*  It's the best team I've seen all year come into the garden in person. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  Uh, they seem to have 20 players that they just rotated in and out. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4576.2s)]
*  I, I didn't know half the names of the players on the team. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4581.799999999999s)]
*  They just came in. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4585.719999999999s)]
*  They played great defense, whoever it was. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4586.5599999999995s)]
*  They got rebounds. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4589.4s)]
*  Uh, they passed well. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4590.92s)]
*  They didn't settle for the three. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4593.36s)]
*  They only took the three when it was open and they had no lane to the basket, but [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4595.04s)]
*  they went to the basket a lot. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4600.44s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the free throw disparity. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4601.639999999999s)]
*  They had over 33 free throws yesterday and they earned them. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4604.5599999999995s)]
*  They went to the basket. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4608.96s)]
*  They were physical. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4609.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, we were terrible. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4611.44s)]
*  We, we just settled for three shot, three point shot after three point shot. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4612.72s)]
*  Nobody wanted to go to the basket. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4618.24s)]
*  Jalen Brown had one of those horrific games that occasionally has, uh, failed [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4620.2s)]
*  out, which is so unusual, but he made dumb fouls, uh, and on top of it, it was [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4626.36s)]
*  my least favorite referee crew. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4633.44s)]
*  So when I saw who the refs were, I was thinking, you know, this is a big game [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4635.879999999999s)]
*  for the NBA it's on, you know, you think they could have brought in a good crew. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4640.639999999999s)]
*  And, uh, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4645.96s)]
*  I wish I should mention my dad's not a Tyler Ford guy. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4647.919999999999s)]
*  So if you see, if you see Tyler Ford doing a South the game, just know [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4651.08s)]
*  my dad's upset immediately. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4655.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4657.12s)]
*  It couldn't have just been me the whole game. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4657.5599999999995s)]
*  The shelter took him. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4660.04s)]
*  I know we complain a lot of the sucks complain a lot on the floor, but there [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4661.2s)]
*  were some really horrendous calls last night and the disparity, you know, you're [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4666.52s)]
*  the home team, even though you're not going to the basket, you should get a [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4671.88s)]
*  few calls, right? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4676.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4677.92s)]
*  See all the Celtic fans were saying this, but we shot 63 threes. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4678.24s)]
*  So at that point, you're probably not going to get a shitload of free throws. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4682.08s)]
*  You know, I, I work on the basket enough. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4685.08s)]
*  I asked, I think Kirk and I talked about the game a little bit, but I left [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4687.28s)]
*  some stuff for you. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4692.28s)]
*  I thought Dort was like the worst possible guy to guard Jalen. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4692.92s)]
*  I thought Jalen could solve him at all. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4696.8s)]
*  He's just strong. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4699.679999999999s)]
*  He's smaller and he just couldn't figure him out. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4700.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4704.4s)]
*  It was so ironic after watching, uh, what a good job Brown did in the [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4704.8s)]
*  previous game on the Lakers. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4711.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4713.32s)]
*  And, uh, in this game, uh, he not only did a poor job on defense, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4713.52s)]
*  Dork killed him. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4720.0s)]
*  Uh, you know, he's built like a linebacker. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4721.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4724.400000000001s)]
*  He just, he really outmuscled him. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4724.6s)]
*  I know everybody's talked about how, what great shape Jalen Brown is in from [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4726.92s)]
*  working out all summer and, you know, he is a pretty big guy, but [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4732.400000000001s)]
*  Dork made him look small. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4736.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4738.92s)]
*  It was, uh, yeah, it was a frustrating game for everybody. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4739.5199999999995s)]
*  So this is 51 or 52 years season tickets for you. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4744.24s)]
*  This is my 51st year. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4748.4s)]
*  How many guards have you seen in person that were better than SGA? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4750.8s)]
*  Oh, I mean, Jordan, obviously. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4756.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4760.04s)]
*  Would you, would you put him on like the, like second highest level, highest level? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4760.76s)]
*  Like he's unstoppable. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4764.96s)]
*  Um, and we were throwing everybody at him. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4767.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4769.96s)]
*  He's, he's in the top 10, obviously. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4770.12s)]
*  Um, I, I've not seen him in person because they didn't go to the [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4772.5599999999995s)]
*  game last year against OKC. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4777.36s)]
*  He was unstoppable. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4779.84s)]
*  And also he's fluid. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4781.5599999999995s)]
*  Like he goes to the basket, looks like he's going to be contained and [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4784.12s)]
*  gets the shot up somehow. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4788.5199999999995s)]
*  He has a lot of tricky shots too. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4789.84s)]
*  Um, and they all go in, uh, if I'm a defender, I'm really frustrated. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4792.88s)]
*  Trying to guard that guy. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4799.2s)]
*  He was really good. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4800.92s)]
*  I already mentioned that he has my MVP vote. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4802.679999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4807.08s)]
*  I don't know if you got a vote this year, but I'm going to pass it along anyway. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4807.44s)]
*  I thought because I was in the documentary, I got to vote this year. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4811.88s)]
*  No, you don't get a vote. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4815.32s)]
*  Would you, the SGA, the inability for us to control him reminded me of [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4818.24s)]
*  Andrew Toney a million years ago. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4822.5599999999995s)]
*  I was thinking of some of the other, cause I remember we went to that [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4824.4s)]
*  finals game in 08 when, uh, when they beat the Lakers that year, but [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4827.2s)]
*  Kobe, there was that game too, when the Lakers started coming back and Kobe [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4832.599999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden was unstoppable for like two minutes and there's the crowd. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4837.2s)]
*  You can feel the energy kind of die. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4841.84s)]
*  Cause you're going, Oh my God, what do we do? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4843.48s)]
*  Um, SGA is a little bit like that. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4846.32s)]
*  Like I was thinking about a series against him and you'd think like with [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4848.36s)]
*  holiday and Derek White, and then some size with Brown and Tatum, this is [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4851.84s)]
*  the right kind of team to stop him, but I'm not sure anyone's stopping him this year. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4856.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I will, I will have a caveat though. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4860.5199999999995s)]
*  He, he goes to the basket frequently. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4863.32s)]
*  I mean, he has a very, very nice, obviously a good outside shot made a couple threes, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4865.88s)]
*  but his, his game is going to the basket. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4871.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4874.2s)]
*  No Porzingis. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4874.48s)]
*  Are you going there? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4875.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4876.32s)]
*  Porzingis would have made a difference in the middle. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4876.639999999999s)]
*  Uh, we got out, we mounted out hustled. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4879.0s)]
*  They played a two big lineup and our two bigs were Horford and, uh, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4882.76s)]
*  yeah, Luke Cornett, Luke Cornett. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4888.48s)]
*  And, uh, we just didn't match up very well, but it wasn't just that they're a [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4890.4s)]
*  driving team and they had a lot of laps. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4894.92s)]
*  And I know Porzingis would have made a difference out there. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4898.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4901.36s)]
*  But the problem is, and you and I talk about this constantly, like Porzingis [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4901.48s)]
*  has hit the point where it's exciting to have him, but you notice when he's in [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4906.0s)]
*  the game and he just hasn't played enough and there's this reason, that reason, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4911.04s)]
*  another reason. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4915.12s)]
*  And now I'm at the point where you think about having to get through the Knicks [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4915.96s)]
*  and Cleveland and okay, so he potentially, I don't think they can win all three of [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4920.08s)]
*  those rounds without Porzingis. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4924.04s)]
*  And I have no idea if he's going to be available. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4925.32s)]
*  I agree. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4927.6s)]
*  Um, I was just reading the, he's missed seven of the last eight games in the one [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4928.32s)]
*  game he did play, he, he had, he was limited minutes and it's very mysterious. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4932.72s)]
*  He has, he has this virus that has, that they can't find out what it is. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4938.84s)]
*  He was at the game last night, all dressed up, sitting on the bench. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4944.24s)]
*  He looked great, but he wasn't playing the game. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4947.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4950.320000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't get it. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4950.88s)]
*  What you've gone to a lot of these games, what's up with the, why aren't [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4952.24s)]
*  they better at home this year? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4955.320000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4956.320000000001s)]
*  Too many threes. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4957.96s)]
*  Um, they get three happy at home. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4959.08s)]
*  They don't, they don't seem to go to the, that's one thing. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4961.16s)]
*  They don't go to the basket as much. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4965.6s)]
*  The other thing that I've noticed is that they always start slow. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4967.04s)]
*  Uh, it's like they, they didn't wake up yet. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4971.24s)]
*  Last night was a prime example. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4974.96s)]
*  It was nine, nothing. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4976.6s)]
*  And they took a time out. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4977.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4979.2s)]
*  Now you have nine points you have to make up. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4979.76s)]
*  And what do we lose by? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4982.5199999999995s)]
*  I think we lost by, you know, seven or eight. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4983.8s)]
*  Um, I don't know why the slow starts. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4987.04s)]
*  I don't know whether, I don't know what's going on there. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4989.64s)]
*  They, you know, if you noticed last night, our first 10 shots with three point shots, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4992.84s)]
*  yeah, if they're not going in, that leads to a defensive rebound, a fast break by [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=4999.88s)]
*  the other team and suddenly they're scoring and, uh, we don't work the ball [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5005.4800000000005s)]
*  on the side when for Zingas isn't there. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5010.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, the thing is, if I showed you, if you didn't even watch the game and I just [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5012.84s)]
*  showed you the stat sheet and it was like, we shot 63 threes and 12 free throws. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5016.4400000000005s)]
*  They got, we lost. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5020.5199999999995s)]
*  Like that's, that's just, that's a guaranteed loss. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5021.879999999999s)]
*  The guy in front of me, Mike said to me is wet almost the end of the first quarter. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5024.879999999999s)]
*  He said, you know, we haven't taken or made a two point shot yet. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5029.48s)]
*  Every time it was a free or free free throw, you can't win against a team like [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5034.48s)]
*  OKC playing that kind of basketball. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5039.839999999999s)]
*  It's, you know, it's hit or miss. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5042.36s)]
*  Can you give us your, uh, your Tatum? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5045.32s)]
*  You've watched every season of Tatum's career. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5048.12s)]
*  You've been going, I feel like he's gone up half a level. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5050.12s)]
*  I thought he was awesome in the Laker game. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5053.5599999999995s)]
*  I thought he was really good last night. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5055.4s)]
*  It certainly wasn't the reason they lost. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5056.92s)]
*  Um, and in general feels like he's gone up a notch. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5058.72s)]
*  So what are you seeing in person? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5062.72s)]
*  I feel, I agree with you. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5064.88s)]
*  He's gone up a notch. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5066.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the best season he's had that I've seen him play. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5067.92s)]
*  Uh, he's, he's like a, uh, the general out there controls all of our offensive [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5071.16s)]
*  action. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5076.88s)]
*  Um, you know, it's every game he takes three or four shots. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5077.96s)]
*  He kind of wish he didn't take, uh, that maybe, and I don't know whether, you [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5082.92s)]
*  know, too many times going to the basket, you know, you don't want to be hit every [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5089.88s)]
*  time you go in there, but it seems like every time he goes to the basket, he can [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5093.76s)]
*  score. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5098.4400000000005s)]
*  I like when he goes to the basket, but then pulls up and takes that 15 footer. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5099.56s)]
*  I feel like that's unstoppable. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5103.6s)]
*  It's, it, he, it's been unstoppable the last month or so, but he doesn't do it [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5105.0s)]
*  that often. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5110.32s)]
*  He'll more often settle, you know, he'll be out three point line and all of a [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5111.2s)]
*  sudden I look up and the shot clocks at six seconds, five seconds, and he takes [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5116.04s)]
*  that fall away pretty long three point shot and it's hit or miss. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5121.36s)]
*  He doesn't have a good percentage on that. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5126.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5128.44s)]
*  I'm not, I'd love to see him go to the basket more, you know, maybe if Porzingis [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5128.72s)]
*  was out there opening the lane up a little bit, uh, OKC really clogged the [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5133.12s)]
*  lane with their bigs. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5137.88s)]
*  There wasn't a lot of room to drive, which I understand from, you know, why [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5139.5199999999995s)]
*  they took so many threes, but you would have been frustrated sitting at that game. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5144.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5149.24s)]
*  I didn't enjoy watching it on TV. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5149.76s)]
*  I mean, the biggest thing that shifted this year is we left last season, Tatum [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5151.72s)]
*  and Brown were kind of one A one B. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5155.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5157.68s)]
*  And Tatum has really, and it's not Jaylen has had some good stretches and some bad [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5158.68s)]
*  stretches, but Tatum, the amount of stuff that he's doing game to game on both [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5163.52s)]
*  sides is he's also the best rebounder on the team, where he defends everybody on [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5167.8s)]
*  the other team. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5172.64s)]
*  Uh, he runs the offense. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5173.8s)]
*  I think he's having an awesome season. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5175.52s)]
*  Like to me, he's clearly the number three MVP and there's, there's some [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5178.28s)]
*  Yanis people are like, well, Yanis is 30 and 12 and six, but I just think the [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5181.72s)]
*  Celtics are more successful and Tatum has as big of a burden and he's also [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5186.28s)]
*  running the offense. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5190.679999999999s)]
*  So a couple of other trends that I noticed, you know, it was the fourth quarter [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5192.2s)]
*  middle of the fourth quarter and Jaylen Brown had four points and five fouls. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5196.679999999999s)]
*  That's your, that's your highest paid player. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5202.5599999999995s)]
*  You can't get that out of that guy. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5206.32s)]
*  And you're trying to light a fire under Jaylen Brown right now. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5208.28s)]
*  I didn't understand his game last night. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5211.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5214.0s)]
*  The other thing you and I have talked about it, their bench, uh, okay. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5214.6s)]
*  See his bench was terrific. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5218.6s)]
*  Our bench wasn't, um, I know when you have a starter at everybody moves up a [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5221.04s)]
*  little bit, but I love Pritchard and I love how's a, but in really big games [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5226.280000000001s)]
*  against really good teams, who have a good defense, they shut them down. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5231.92s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5237.16s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5238.240000000001s)]
*  That's why I don't think Pritchard he's favorite to win six man, but I've just [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5238.8s)]
*  seen too many games where I don't think he's impactful enough, whereas like [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5243.04s)]
*  Cleveland that Ty Jerome will come in and he'll just swing the game when he comes [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5247.04s)]
*  in, you know, there's games where Pritchard doesn't do that, but I also think [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5250.32s)]
*  the amount of money they're paying for the top six guys in this team. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5254.16s)]
*  It's really hard to have a bench, you know, like it's just, it's just hard to [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5258.88s)]
*  find that ninth, 10th, 11th guy when you're showing out the amount of [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5264.16s)]
*  money that they're paying. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5267.32s)]
*  So it makes sense, but I agree. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5268.28s)]
*  I thought, okay, see just seemed so much deeper last night. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5270.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5273.68s)]
*  See did something else that the teams that are beating us seem to be doing. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5274.0s)]
*  They're picking us up almost at half court trying to put miles on Tatum. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5278.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5283.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5283.36s)]
*  And, and, uh, pushing us out, pushing us out further and making us. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5283.76s)]
*  And by doing that, when you look up at the shot clock, it's 10 seconds to go. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5290.2s)]
*  By the way, we did that to the Lakers on Saturday. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5294.56s)]
*  That was one of the big reasons they, they were making Luca and LeBron like [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5297.16s)]
*  really work just to bring the ball up, which I don't understand why more [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5301.12s)]
*  teams don't do against them. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5304.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5305.88s)]
*  That's what that's why Brown was so effective against Luca against the Lakers. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5306.12s)]
*  Um, it was, you know, Brown was on, uh, um, Alexander last night quite a bit, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5310.88s)]
*  but he's a different kind of player than, uh, Luca in person. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5318.12s)]
*  He's very slight. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5324.8s)]
*  Uh, you don't expect him to be, you know, he gets [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5326.28s)]
*  a lot of rebounds. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5331.0s)]
*  He's, he's slid through the lane. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5331.88s)]
*  Like very few players I've seen. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5335.08s)]
*  Um, and Brown couldn't stop them. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5338.56s)]
*  So would you have us, you said you saw a Boston Cleveland game in person too. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5341.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5345.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5346.16s)]
*  Would you have us third with those three right now? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5346.92s)]
*  Right now I would. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5350.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would too. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5351.16s)]
*  Well, for, for, for kind of a different reason. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5352.32s)]
*  I know that, okay. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5354.36s)]
*  See, he had a, uh, the Williams kid didn't play last night, but, um, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5355.32s)]
*  Cleveland is a hundred percent healthy usually this year. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5359.5599999999995s)]
*  And you and I talked about it. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5363.44s)]
*  I thought they made a couple of great additions for their bench. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5365.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5368.2s)]
*  We like Hunter. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5368.44s)]
*  I always loved Hunter and I always, when Jerome was on OKC, I thought [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5369.48s)]
*  he's a great guy off the bench. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5375.12s)]
*  So who gets them both Cleveland. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5377.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5380.08s)]
*  I mean, I know they had cap room, but, and that's like you said earlier, that's [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5380.4s)]
*  where we have a difficulty when our six players make so much money at the top. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5385.12s)]
*  What's the, uh, what's the Patriots fever right now with the free agents [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5391.24s)]
*  and the number four pick? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5395.36s)]
*  Well, I think people like the additions. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5397.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5402.24s)]
*  With the exception of why haven't we signed a receiver and why haven't [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5402.72s)]
*  we signed an offensive tackle? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5407.24s)]
*  And, uh, like the paper today that cam, I don't, I can't say I've ever [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5409.32s)]
*  seen cam Robinson play except he is a left tackle and maybe a plug [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5414.8s)]
*  him in for a year. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5420.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5421.400000000001s)]
*  It's tough. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5421.64s)]
*  It's tough when the case for somebody is he has two arms, two legs and a [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5422.12s)]
*  head and he plays left tackle. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5425.68s)]
*  Like, all right, 20 million. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5427.12s)]
*  Let's give him a chance. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5428.8s)]
*  Coup a cup from, uh, the Rams. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5431.68s)]
*  You think he's done? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5436.16s)]
*  I think he's, I think it's a rep. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5437.16s)]
*  There's some bad stats with him about getting open like year by year [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5439.52s)]
*  the last five years where last year he just doesn't get open anymore. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5443.84s)]
*  We don't need another guy who can't get open. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5447.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5450.68s)]
*  We already have five guys who can't get open. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5450.96s)]
*  I here's where I've talked myself into. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5453.08s)]
*  Um, well, first of all, I'm, I'm praying the giants take Sanders cause they [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5455.88s)]
*  don't have a quarterback and it seems like Rogers might go to Pittsburgh [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5460.24s)]
*  and they haven't done anything else. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5463.08s)]
*  So it's like, please take Sanders. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5464.28s)]
*  I'm, I am all in. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5466.68s)]
*  I'm planning my flag in this cause they don't need a Graham cause they [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5468.6s)]
*  beefed up the defensive line. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5471.88s)]
*  I'm all in on Travis Hunter. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5474.2s)]
*  I'm all in on taking him at receiver at four and then maybe in the dime [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5476.360000000001s)]
*  packages, he comes in and plays some D back, but just can, can you turn [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5480.84s)]
*  him into a top five receiver? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5485.56s)]
*  I think you could. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5487.32s)]
*  That's your number one receiver. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5488.6s)]
*  You also have the flexibility. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5490.0s)]
*  Maybe he can play on the other side of the ball a little bit. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5491.32s)]
*  It's just like, he's, it just seems like he's a sure thing. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5494.24s)]
*  I want a sure thing at the number four. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5498.08s)]
*  I want, I want like a blue chipper who would be a $35 million player [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5499.96s)]
*  a year someday. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5503.8s)]
*  That's what I want. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5504.72s)]
*  I agree with it. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5505.64s)]
*  It seems like there's two sure things, uh, Hunter and Carter, and it would [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5506.32s)]
*  be fabulous to have Carter on a defensive line with the additions we've made. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5512.28s)]
*  Otherwise trade back. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5517.08s)]
*  Like if you don't get one of those two trade back, it trade back. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5518.4s)]
*  Um, and maybe take one of the other tackles at 10 or 11 or somewhere in there. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5521.72s)]
*  I do love the Drake May Hunter. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5528.24s)]
*  I day would be super fun, but I think this has been a really fun draft to follow, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5530.2s)]
*  especially like we just need two teams to take a quarterback ahead of us. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5533.68s)]
*  And then it shubs the guys down and you're just watching the giants, not [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5538.0s)]
*  get anyone, not make the Stafford trade, not get a free agent. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5541.08s)]
*  I'm feeling, I'm feeling optimistic that, you know, what happens in these drafts [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5545.4s)]
*  teams get really anxious. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5552.88s)]
*  I don't have a quarterback. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5555.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5556.64s)]
*  And, uh, there's two quarterbacks sitting there. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5557.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5559.64s)]
*  I, I not going to be at all surprised if we don't see the giants take the quarterback. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5560.32s)]
*  Uh, they have no quarterback. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5566.32s)]
*  I can't, I can't wait. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5568.4800000000005s)]
*  It's going to be the most exciting draft we've had in a while because, um, to pick [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5570.16s)]
*  this high and potentially have it work out. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5575.0s)]
*  Um, Marsha can we talk Marsha for a second? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5577.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5580.24s)]
*  Um, very, I hate the way the Bruins, um, let our 16 year old, 16 year veteran [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5580.8s)]
*  captain of the team just walk away somewhere else, especially to an [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5590.6s)]
*  arch enemy team, the band. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5595.320000000001s)]
*  That was the worst part for me was Florida. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5597.320000000001s)]
*  Just come on at all the teams. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5600.04s)]
*  That's who, that's who you're going to trade them to. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5603.320000000001s)]
*  Well, the other thing is they, they gave a crazy amount of money to Lin home. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5605.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5610.56s)]
*  The forward or center forward and he, and he's terrible. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5611.400000000001s)]
*  So we know Marsha and gives 110%. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5615.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5619.320000000001s)]
*  He's our second leading score. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5619.68s)]
*  It was our second leading score, uh, pony up some money. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5621.400000000001s)]
*  And he's a legend. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5625.240000000001s)]
*  He's going to retire, retire, retire as a hall of fame or all that stuff. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5626.120000000001s)]
*  It's the part of sports that I hate. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5630.360000000001s)]
*  But it's the Danny age thing, right? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5632.92s)]
*  Where Danny age used to say, if I was running the Celtics in the late [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5634.6s)]
*  eighties, I would have traded Bird and McKaylin started over. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5638.48s)]
*  You can't be loyal to the memories. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5641.0s)]
*  He traded Kevin Garnett in 2013. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5642.639999999999s)]
*  It's like the best thing for the team is to make the move, but I don't know. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5645.28s)]
*  You get like a late pick in the first round. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5648.879999999999s)]
*  It's not like this is making a break in your future. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5650.96s)]
*  Well, it's not even a first. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5653.36s)]
*  It's a second, a conditional second that can turn into a first. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5655.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5657.879999999999s)]
*  I just think that Marsha was not the guy you trade. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5660.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5664.28s)]
*  You, you work it out or you let them, you let them stay here until the end of the year. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5664.88s)]
*  We're not, we're not going anywhere. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5670.599999999999s)]
*  Um, his cousin, Brian. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5672.28s)]
*  All right. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5673.759999999999s)]
*  I know he took this one hard. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5674.36s)]
*  He did take this one. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5675.92s)]
*  There's nobody left. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5677.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, who's like, who's going to be the, well, pastor next to your number one [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5679.2s)]
*  Jersey in the stands now, but other than that, nobody left from 2000, early 2010s. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5683.28s)]
*  That whole run. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5688.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5689.44s)]
*  Now that the irony is I think within the two weeks that they traded Marsha and [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5690.240000000001s)]
*  they, they identified next year's ticket prices, which they raised quite a bit. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5695.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5701.96s)]
*  So the timing was terrible. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5703.04s)]
*  I also, they're in, don't you think that Neely and Sweeney are on thin ice in [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5705.56s)]
*  terms of where we're headed and the move, the moves we made over the last five years? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5712.56s)]
*  Well, it's a whole generation now that they won the cup though. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5718.96s)]
*  The month I started Grantland. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5723.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5725.56s)]
*  This is a million years ago. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5726.240000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like, uh, you have like 20 year old kids now that barely remember it. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5727.68s)]
*  It was for me, it was two dogs ago. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5732.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5735.56s)]
*  That's how, yeah, I forgot. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5735.88s)]
*  That's how you measure dog years or living dogs. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5736.84s)]
*  Um, yeah, I don't know. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5740.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5741.52s)]
*  Uh, cause they have that. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5742.080000000001s)]
*  And then the other thing is the Celtic sale that somebody [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5743.64s)]
*  made for today. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5747.6s)]
*  Did you see it? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5748.240000000001s)]
*  There's four left. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5749.68s)]
*  The four left. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5750.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5751.56s)]
*  And the bids are the final bits are coming in Friday. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5751.8s)]
*  There was five and Lurie dropped out the Eagles owner. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5753.92s)]
*  I think he, I think, uh, like pretty soon after the super bowl was out, I [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5757.56s)]
*  thought they thought they, they thought there was going to be five. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5762.56s)]
*  Um, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5765.6s)]
*  when they look at a lengthy writeup in Boston, well, without that, um, it [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5766.280000000001s)]
*  doesn't look like anybody has the means to pay for this team without a lot of [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5771.240000000001s)]
*  backup support. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5777.4s)]
*  So that's one of the things about it. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5778.719999999999s)]
*  Well, one of the things is nobody knows the composition of all the groups. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5781.28s)]
*  So you have all these minority partners who are going to throw in money, but [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5785.28s)]
*  nobody knows what side they picked with the four left and who's on whose team. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5788.32s)]
*  So it's, it's a lot of, uh, but tying to the Bruins, I think part of the play [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5793.92s)]
*  would be you'd build a new arena. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5798.759999999999s)]
*  And so you're paying for the team, but then you also know, like in the [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5801.12s)]
*  2030s, there's going to be some sort of basketball arena that you build. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5805.12s)]
*  That's like what the Quippers did. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5809.84s)]
*  So it's really, you're like 10 billion all in. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5811.44s)]
*  So you need like the capital behind that. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5813.36s)]
*  But for the Bruins, it's not great because they're going to be stuck in [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5815.72s)]
*  this other building, then be the only tenant seven years. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5818.96s)]
*  And then the team hasn't been, you know, it's definitely arrow pointing down. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5821.88s)]
*  So it's interesting times [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5825.8s)]
*  a building that's going to be 30 years old soon. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5827.5199999999995s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5830.8s)]
*  Remember driving by the garden and just seeing the carcass of half of a stadium [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5831.72s)]
*  for that whole winter and 94. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5836.4800000000005s)]
*  I remember almost 30 years ago after we had our tickets in the old garden, 20 [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5838.72s)]
*  years plus, them taking me into this new garden to pick a seat 30 years ago now. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5844.0s)]
*  And it, it, I know they've done it as much as they could refreshing it, but [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5851.2s)]
*  it is what it is. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5856.08s)]
*  Uh, it's not like the new arena, like you've been talking about the [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5857.12s)]
*  Clippers place, how spectacular it is. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5860.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5863.72s)]
*  No, I think the Lakers are in the same boat. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5864.92s)]
*  The Staples was built, I think in like 99 or 2000, it's quote unquote state of [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5866.72s)]
*  the art, but it's really not, it sucks. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5870.84s)]
*  And now they're in this, what do you do? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5873.0s)]
*  And you have the Quippers who have this incredible arena. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5875.4400000000005s)]
*  So I know that's going to be a piece of the Celtics purchase. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5877.76s)]
*  You have to think arena. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5880.8s)]
*  But you know, Boston as well as I do, there's no land. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5882.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5885.84s)]
*  there's one part that if you go back and you read, remember when we, we were going [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5886.48s)]
*  to have the Olympics in Boston for that before it got shut down, they had a whole [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5890.759999999999s)]
*  plan for where it was going to be. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5895.2s)]
*  And one of the, uh, one of the big locations was going to be on 93 past, like [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5896.44s)]
*  where Emerson is going toward like Quincy and the Cape section. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5902.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5907.48s)]
*  And I think that's where the arena would go. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5908.2s)]
*  If I think that's the location and I think it's open. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5909.96s)]
*  So I, whatever, it'll definitely, something's definitely going to happen over the next [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5913.5199999999995s)]
*  10 years, but that the big thing for me with the Celtic sale is like, Peg Luca is [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5917.679999999999s)]
*  one of the four guys left. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5921.639999999999s)]
*  He's the number two owner right now. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5923.28s)]
*  He's the one that if he gets it, you have the stability, you keep the organization [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5925.599999999999s)]
*  intact. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5929.4s)]
*  If the other three guys, any of those guys get it, who knows? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5930.4s)]
*  They just come in like, here are my ideas. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5934.28s)]
*  I'm bringing in my own guys and you could have just complete dysfunction. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5936.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5939.879999999999s)]
*  And that really works. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5940.2s)]
*  It's like the year John Y Brown came in from Kentucky. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5941.44s)]
*  Uh, you know, people come in for outside of Massachusetts. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5945.36s)]
*  They, they come in with their whole, uh, different ideas, you know, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5949.04s)]
*  well, they all want to do their one thing. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5954.4s)]
*  And then you end up in the Luca Dacic situation where you have the new Dallas [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5955.879999999999s)]
*  owners are like, yeah, let's trade them. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5959.36s)]
*  We get Anthony Davis and a pick Max Christie. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5961.28s)]
*  The other thing we've talked about it, if they don't have the power to do it, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5964.5199999999995s)]
*  if they don't have deep enough pockets, um, Brown's probably on his way out the door. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5969.32s)]
*  Um, the tax bill is pretty crazy. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5977.4s)]
*  It is crazy. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5980.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5982.0s)]
*  I think some of it will depend on what happens in the playoffs, but yeah, I'm [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5982.639999999999s)]
*  prepared as a fan, I'm prepared. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5986.2s)]
*  And you are too, like, I don't know what's going to happen. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5988.08s)]
*  You're going to have this new owner group paying six plus billion dollars. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5990.639999999999s)]
*  The team, let's say they don't win the title and then they're looking at a [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5996.12s)]
*  tax bill of $200 million on top of what they just paid. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=5999.12s)]
*  And it's like, all right, first move. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6002.5599999999995s)]
*  I've decided to do this. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6004.76s)]
*  God only knows what that's going to be. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6006.16s)]
*  It could be anything. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6007.96s)]
*  They've already, we got, we just got our packages a couple of weeks ago for season [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6008.96s)]
*  tickets for next year, significant increase in ticket prices. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6013.92s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6018.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6019.16s)]
*  And I understand, you know, one of the [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6019.72s)]
*  You mean, maybe to wire you some money? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6021.5199999999995s)]
*  I just wanted to mention it. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6024.84s)]
*  You know, I'll flag it. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6026.16s)]
*  I'll talk to my guy. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6027.5599999999995s)]
*  I read online yesterday that you signed a new contract. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6029.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's a nice of extra. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6031.96s)]
*  So they rate, so they jacked it like 10%. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6037.04s)]
*  Oh, that's a good, each seating area has a different percentage, but, uh, I just [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6039.88s)]
*  wanted to mention it, you know, as long as we're talking. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6045.0s)]
*  Well, you, we have the episode three of Celtic city, which spoiler alert, we, you [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6047.2s)]
*  popped in, we interviewed a hundred plus people and we interviewed some old season [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6051.72s)]
*  ticket owners, but that first year you bought the, you bought your ticket. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6055.4s)]
*  It was four bucks. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6059.5599999999995s)]
*  Four dollars. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6060.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6061.32s)]
*  Four dollars for the 73, 74 season, four dollars. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6061.5599999999995s)]
*  So now it's like, what is it now? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6064.92s)]
*  Like, like 400 a ticket? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6066.839999999999s)]
*  Well, no, not that high. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6069.08s)]
*  Is it up there? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6073.2s)]
*  Oh, we can talk after. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6073.92s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6075.12s)]
*  They flex the tickets. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6075.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6077.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6078.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6079.08s)]
*  So there's no one price for the seat for one game. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6079.4s)]
*  You come in and you see, uh, Dallas now, one of the terrible teams or new New [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6084.0s)]
*  Orleans, it's a totally different price than the Lakers, for example. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6089.24s)]
*  And Philly, they could probably, when Philly comes in again, they could [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6094.04s)]
*  probably tank those tickets and knock them down. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6096.96s)]
*  But, uh, you know, it's understandable that they raised the prices. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6101.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6105.639999999999s)]
*  On the Bruins end, it's not understandable for the product they're putting out and [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6106.24s)]
*  the fact that they let their captain go. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6110.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6112.84s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6113.72s)]
*  Like when we, when you add, we used to go to the games in the seventies and it was [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6114.16s)]
*  all blue collar, all, all like just the most normal people possible. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6118.68s)]
*  And then the eighties, we just started watching them go away one at a time. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6124.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6128.76s)]
*  And I remember the guy, the guy with the hat, with the mustache, like that guy [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6129.2s)]
*  who was in all of a sudden he was gone and just, and it just, and then by the time [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6133.6s)]
*  we got to the fleet center, it was just completely different. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6137.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6139.72s)]
*  Big bird with the sun. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6139.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6141.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6141.759999999999s)]
*  All the regular Mary in front of us, all the regulars. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6142.0s)]
*  Now there's a new group of very nice people. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6145.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6147.799999999999s)]
*  It's a, it's a different group. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6148.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6149.599999999999s)]
*  There's still some old timers there though. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6149.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there are. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6151.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6152.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6153.16s)]
*  But you're like, I think you're like in the top six of longest runs now or top five. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6153.92s)]
*  Yeah, I should be. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6158.08s)]
*  I think. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6159.36s)]
*  Should honor you at halftime or something. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6160.48s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6162.2s)]
*  They mistakenly say that this season took a hold of his tickets 55 years, but he got [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6162.96s)]
*  them from his brother who passed away. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6169.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6170.8s)]
*  We're right. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6171.08s)]
*  It's not like it should be straight through. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6171.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6173.52s)]
*  I mean, I consider that the same way the lake is counted in Minnesota titles. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6173.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6179.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6179.92s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6180.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6181.52s)]
*  We had that in the episode two of Celtic city. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6182.28s)]
*  They mentioned how the Lakers trying to win their first title in Los Angeles and. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6184.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, they're not counting the Minnesota titles at all. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6189.92s)]
*  And then some of the eighties all of a sudden they're like, yeah, and those five [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6192.400000000001s)]
*  titles we won in Minnesota. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6195.8s)]
*  I'm sure like if OKC wins the title this year, they're not going to be like, it's [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6197.32s)]
*  our second title following the one we won in Seattle. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6201.92s)]
*  They're not going to say that. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6204.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6206.84s)]
*  I think it's crazy. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6207.48s)]
*  I guess were they the Minnesota Lakers? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6209.44s)]
*  So they changed it in Minneapolis Lakers and Minneapolis Lakers. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6211.599999999999s)]
*  So that's, that's what they hang their hat on, I guess. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6215.08s)]
*  You live out there. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6218.84s)]
*  I mean, you should have an argument with some people about, they probably have 12 [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6219.8s)]
*  titles. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6224.639999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you the Luka thing is maddening because they love Luka and that energy at [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6225.48s)]
*  the home games is completely different already. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6230.2s)]
*  And this is like LeBron, like obviously most part, one of the most popular NBA [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6232.5199999999995s)]
*  players of this century and one of the most famous and one of the best, but he's [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6237.92s)]
*  been on all these other teams and it's always year to year with him and he's a [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6243.0s)]
*  Laker, but it's, it's a little more of a hard gun. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6247.36s)]
*  They look at Luka and they're like, this guy's 25, like this guy might be in our [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6249.8s)]
*  life for the next 15 years. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6252.88s)]
*  Like you can just feel the energy shift. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6253.72s)]
*  So when Zoe's date shows up at the front door with a Luka jersey on. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6256.8s)]
*  No, that's it. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6261.64s)]
*  That's the door gets slammed. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6262.400000000001s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6263.72s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6264.4800000000005s)]
*  Don't ever worry about that. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6265.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6266.32s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6266.84s)]
*  Good to see you. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6267.32s)]
*  Congrats on your dramatic debut in episode three, Celtic City. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6268.72s)]
*  I still can't, I still haven't hired an agent. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6273.2s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6276.56s)]
*  I don't think you need to. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6277.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6278.76s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6279.72s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO-wxUHEPls&t=6280.36s)]
