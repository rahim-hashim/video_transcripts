# Should the NBA Ban Corner 3s? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8)
*  You want to talk about the Celtics? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=0.0s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=1.34s)]
*  I have to talk. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=3.84s)]
*  It's what I've been writing about for 10 years now with you and other places. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=4.66s)]
*  And in books is like, these guys are elevating three points [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=8.36s)]
*  shooting to another level. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=11.68s)]
*  Like if we go from the splash brothers to the Dantoni Hardin industrial [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=13.0s)]
*  complex in Houston, we think it can't get any higher. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=18.06s)]
*  Your team, Bill Simmons is taking it higher. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=22.1s)]
*  They are shooting over 53s a game and they're making 43% of them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=25.419999999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure either of those numbers are sustainable, but I'm not copping out here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=31.36s)]
*  I expect this team to break three point shooting records by the end of the season. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=35.98s)]
*  I think they'll break the record for most attempts and most makes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=39.96s)]
*  And Missoula ball. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=43.78s)]
*  Has not only won a championship, but it's doing it by extending Darryl [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=46.08s)]
*  Mori and Stephen Curry's legacy deep into the 2020s and, and, and proving once [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=50.4s)]
*  and for all the three point revolution isn't dead. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=55.66s)]
*  In fact, the best teams in the league are still finding ways to leverage three [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=57.9s)]
*  point shooting and profound new ways. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=62.22s)]
*  So your team, I think is becoming the new splash brothers or sort of hard and rockets. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=64.9s)]
*  It's like the splash family. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=69.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=72.22s)]
*  It was interesting last night they brought it against the bucks they brought in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=72.4s)]
*  Jordan Walsh and I was like, what the fuck, man, this guy, he's done a good [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  three point shooter. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=79.6s)]
*  It doesn't fit into our system. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  And he took a couple. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=82.52s)]
*  We missed a couple, but, but it's surprising. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=83.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=88.16s)]
*  Well, it's shocking when they put anyone in who can't make an open three, you know, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=88.36s)]
*  and they have an embarrassment of riches all over the place. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=93.08s)]
*  It's it's a, the three point shooting, the fact that they don't have poor [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=95.82s)]
*  Zingas and you don't even really notice, they just have so much depth that now [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=101.96s)]
*  they're paying for the depth. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  They're going to have a crazy luxury tax bill. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  I love, uh, I love what I've seen from Tatum and Brown early on Tatum fixed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  the hitch, which thank God, I think he's a legitimate MVP candidate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=114.08s)]
*  Michael Pena wrote about that for the ringer.com today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  And I completely agree. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=121.76s)]
*  If, if they're going to be in the sixties for wins, you got to really seriously [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=123.18s)]
*  look at whoever the best players, but I love everything I've seen from Tatum. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  Um, and then Jaylen, I feel like has taken all the shit that he was doing last year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=131.44s)]
*  And it's maybe even like just a hair better. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=136.76s)]
*  Um, and the two of them together, it's everything Steve Kerr always told me [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=140.62s)]
*  about, uh, the year after you win the title, that first two months, the next [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=144.84s)]
*  season, you're just like, you're so locked in, you have so much confidence. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  And that's, that's, it's gotten to the point, like, I would be surprised [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=154.1s)]
*  when they lose, you know, which I feel the same way about. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=157.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=160.2s)]
*  See, we're like, Oh, okay. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=160.48s)]
*  See loss last night. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  That's usually when you know, you have a 61 team. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=163.2s)]
*  It's like, Whoa, shit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=165.46s)]
*  The Celtics lost two in a row. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  Like it's shocking. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=170.66s)]
*  And I think like when Sam, Sam Hauser, but I mean, uh, Peyton Pritchard scores [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=171.04s)]
*  28 points, that's a classic indicator too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=174.58s)]
*  I think when you have a bench player come out and just change a game like that, and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=177.02s)]
*  it's not somebody who could, you would count on doing that more than once or [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  twice a month. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=185.46s)]
*  Um, and, and I just think they are the deepest team in the NBA, not to beat a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=186.66s)]
*  dead horse, but as you, as you mentioned earlier, it's the three point depth. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=191.34s)]
*  In particular, if you want to play for, for Joe Missoula, you have to be able [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=196.26s)]
*  to shoot from 25 feet, you have to, you have to want to shoot it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=200.6s)]
*  He gets mad at his players when they don't shoot them, which is kind of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=204.78s)]
*  the mentality that you need to have. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  It's a lot of guys in the league want to pass up those shots and he actually [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=210.7s)]
*  reprimands this guys and you'll hear them talking about he gets mad when we [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=215.22s)]
*  pass up an open look. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=219.94s)]
*  Um, that's very different than what was happening just 10 years ago around this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=221.78s)]
*  league, but I think they're going to break records in three points shooting, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=225.06s)]
*  potentially offensive efficiency again. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=228.74s)]
*  Um, and, and challenge conventional wisdom further. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=231.82s)]
*  How many threes can we do here? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=235.38s)]
*  I think over half of their shots are three point shots at this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=237.22s)]
*  point, which is crazy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=240.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=243.06s)]
*  So you figure they're taking 53 as a game and making 40% of them. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=243.3s)]
*  That's 20 that's 23 is a game, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=250.82s)]
*  82 games in a year. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=253.7s)]
*  So could they get to like 1700 threes for the season? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=255.78s)]
*  Like it's conceivable. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=261.34s)]
*  I don't know what the record is, but I guarantee nobody's ever had 1600. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=263.38s)]
*  Do they have five guys shooting seven or more in a game right now? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=267.58s)]
*  Um, I think clay Thompson's only done seven or more in a game, like half [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=270.98s)]
*  of his years in the NBA. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=274.3s)]
*  So it's like, it's like a normal clay Thompson year, but they have five of them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=276.02s)]
*  So it is sort of like the splash family. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  Um, and it is subscribe to the, you don't, I remember first talking about this two [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=283.02s)]
*  years ago, but there was some dialogue about it the last couple of days on the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  internets that there's a same nest of these styles now that becomes boring [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=291.14s)]
*  during the regular season. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=297.46s)]
*  I don't, I'm so used to it now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=298.58s)]
*  I, it doesn't seem any different to me. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=300.82s)]
*  And I still feel like there's enough aberration type of players ranging from, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=302.82s)]
*  you know, John Moran to, uh, cam Thomas to, uh, there's some post-up guys. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=308.26s)]
*  We still have like the Shangoon types. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=314.34s)]
*  It's still, it doesn't feel like just up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=316.73999999999995s)]
*  Everybody's checking up threes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll see who wins, but do you see any of that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=320.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I play both sides of that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  I think the, there's never been this much talent in the league and ultimately [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=324.9s)]
*  that's why I turn on the TV set. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=328.17999999999995s)]
*  I love watching the guys, but I'd love to see the NBA move the line. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  I think it's time to move the line. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=332.58s)]
*  I think the shot has become too easy for too many guys. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=333.82s)]
*  Um, I've been really vocal about that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=337.26s)]
*  I think the first time I wrote about it was in 2014, uh, at Grantland [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=339.26s)]
*  after the Spurs won the title. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  Um, and I think it's only, I don't say it's ugly. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to say that, but I think the shot has become too easy for too many. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  And I'd like to see it a little more difficult, um, for the average player. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=353.9s)]
*  And it's only going to make Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard more valuable or [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=358.86s)]
*  Jason Tatum guys who can shoot from deeper will become more valuable in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=361.9s)]
*  a world where the shots harder. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  Uh, so I think it actually celebrates those guys a little bit more. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=367.78s)]
*  Um, I don't know. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=371.14s)]
*  I think, I don't know. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=373.26s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=374.34s)]
*  You think it's, you think it's okay. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=374.94s)]
*  You think everything is hunky dory. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=376.26s)]
*  You don't think it's too many threes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=378.38s)]
*  I always joke, Bill, that it should be called the two point line. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=379.82s)]
*  Once we take more than half of our shots from behind it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=382.73999999999995s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eager to hear what you think on this one, actually. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=386.06s)]
*  I, this was the first time I've seriously started thinking about, do we have to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=391.94s)]
*  fix the corner three a little bit? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=396.82s)]
*  Do you make the arc? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  You change it a little bit. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=400.7s)]
*  So when it goes right to the corner, maybe the line goes so that a corner three no [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  longer exists and you have to be three, four feet over from the corner for it to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=407.17999999999995s)]
*  be a corner three, that that would be the only thing that I could see five, six [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=413.78s)]
*  years from now, if they're going to tweak it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=418.26s)]
*  I could see the whole arc of the three point line, instead of it just being like [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=421.18s)]
*  almost like a semi-circle, the way it looks now being different where it kind of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=424.78s)]
*  gets, it hits the corner in a way that you corner threes are gone. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=429.74s)]
*  It goes up higher so that like the peak of it is like 28 feet instead of 24 or [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=433.62s)]
*  whatever, and maybe that's where we're heading, but I also, I don't, I don't [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=440.26s)]
*  know if that would help the product because then it's like just guys heaving [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=444.94s)]
*  these long shots and these long rebounds. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=448.26s)]
*  And I think that would cause too many unintended consequences, but you could [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=450.38s)]
*  tell me like, could they experiment with the corner three for preseason? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=455.14s)]
*  See what it looks like? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=458.42s)]
*  I wouldn't be against it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=459.9s)]
*  I don't think I've ever shared this, but in 2019, after my book came out, Adam [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=461.34s)]
*  Silver had reached out to me and said, will you come present some of this stuff [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=465.06s)]
*  to the, to the league? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  And, and we had suggested two different three point lines and we got to the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=469.3s)]
*  competition committee and we were going to try it in the G league bill. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=473.5s)]
*  We're going to try two or three different looks in the G league. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=476.7s)]
*  And I'd love for them to revisit. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=480.38s)]
*  One was to get rid of the corner three entirely, which is very drastic. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, I think it was Brad Stevens who was on the competition [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=485.1s)]
*  committee, he was like, hell no. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=488.02s)]
*  They'll never see a slam dunk again. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=489.5s)]
*  This is going to ruin spacing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=491.06s)]
*  So, you know, you have to see it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=492.42s)]
*  You have to see how the league reacts to these things because it could end [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=494.5s)]
*  up making the product worse, like hand up, like some of these ideas might [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=499.98s)]
*  not be good ideas for the product. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=503.82s)]
*  And I think the better one is to keep the corners where they are, but extend [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=506.38s)]
*  the three point arc, which is currently 23.75, get it out to 25 or 26 feet, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=510.46s)]
*  like you described, but again, you're exactly right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=515.98s)]
*  Does that just mean we're watching more missed threes, the same number of threes, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=519.26s)]
*  but fewer makes, cause that's not great. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=523.02s)]
*  So I think we'd have to see it in practice to see what it would look like [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=524.9s)]
*  before we would sort of engineer the right product. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=528.9s)]
*  What I would say is every other league on the planet that matters, the W [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=531.66s)]
*  college basketball fee, but they've all moved the line back this century. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=535.94s)]
*  The NBA is the only one that hasn't. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I think that's going to be a bigger conversation as [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=540.74s)]
*  your Celtics continue to rain down, uh, dozens of threes on their [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=543.98s)]
*  opponent on a nightly basis. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=548.1s)]
*  One other thing I was thinking is maybe there's a limit for threes. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=550.1400000000001s)]
*  Once you make 20, you just can only make two pointers from that point on. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  You've basically used up your 20 and that's it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=558.74s)]
*  Like maybe that's where it goes. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=560.82s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=563.6600000000001s)]
*  I think I like that one. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=564.7s)]
*  I like that one. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=566.74s)]
*  I like it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=567.7s)]
*  It's like, I don't like timeouts. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  Uh, sorry, that's your last three. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=569.62s)]
*  So I hope you're ready to post up poor Zingas for the rest of the game. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=571.6600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's going to be, it would be wild to see how [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  teams would change their offense. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=577.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=579.38s)]
*  Maybe they wouldn't shoot threes in the, in the first quarter. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMQRVzCoN8&t=579.5400000000001s)]
