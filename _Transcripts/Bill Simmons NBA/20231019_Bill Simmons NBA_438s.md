# Will Jordan Poole and the Wizards Surprise the East? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBz7AfD7jiE)
*  The wizards of Washington.
*  23 and a half.
*  Last year they were 35 and 47.
*  They are 13 to one to make the playoffs house.
*  Here's the starting five, as far as I could tell.
*  Tias Jones, who's just on eBay right now, just like, does anyone want to trade for a point guard who's been in some big games?
*  Jordan Poole, who Kevin Garnett unironically asked, could he be used like James Harden on Houston?
*  That was an actual podcast moment.
*  Corey Kispert, who has some nice, nice shooting percentages.
*  Kyle Kuzmin just got paid and Gafford.
*  This team is awful house.
*  Why do you think they can go over?
*  Because this team is not any worse than the team that the Washington franchise put on the floor last season.
*  Talent wise, this team, I would argue.
*  The 35 win last year team.
*  That's right.
*  That team had poor Zynga scoring 23 a game.
*  Well, and Beal.
*  Kuzma, they had 40 games of Beal last season.
*  So part of house's premise is Poole can replace a lot of the Beal stats.
*  He can replace all of them.
*  He'll certainly replace the field goal tubs.
*  Kuzma was the guy who got the touches at the end of the game, not poor Zynga.
*  And it was proper.
*  Winning recipe there.
*  He's a lot more.
*  The problem, the reason that I love this is because 23 and a half is so low.
*  Yeah.
*  So they have three guys that are professional guys that are auditioning for their next situation.
*  Tias Jones, Jordan Poole, Kyle Kuzma.
*  They're not motivated.
*  They're not motivated to go stink though.
*  They're like competent.
*  They're not incompetent.
*  And Dilan Wright is going to be a tremendous asset for somebody.
*  Look at that guy's advanced metrics.
*  Haral Babbo has loved him.
*  He gets his hands on balls, you know, better than a Kardashian.
*  It's an amazing skill set.
*  He's tremendous at this.
*  Don't sleep on my guy, Kula Bali.
*  Balak Kula Bali.
*  They actually, I think this new regime in Washington hit a draft pick.
*  Yeah.
*  This dude is crazy long, has tremendous poise.
*  He played with Wemby all year last year.
*  He's not afraid of nothing.
*  He thinks he belongs on a professional basketball court.
*  There is some quotes coming out about him from the players and coaches that are like
*  reminiscent of the baby rhino stuff with Jaylen Carter and the Eagles.
*  Where the teammates are like, this guy, Jesus.
*  Holy mackerel.
*  They suck, dude.
*  I don't, I don't.
*  They do suck.
*  Don't misunderstand.
*  24 wins is a W though.
*  24 wins.
*  You're not getting a 20.
*  Here's the reason.
*  You won't get to 20 wins.
*  They will start tanking at the trade deadline when most of these guys are gone.
*  They're going to go like two for 28.
*  55 games between the start of the season and the, and the, and the trade deadline.
*  So if they win 20, this is the first time I've ever been worried about you as a
*  Western basketball fan.
*  And 30 through the first 50 games.
*  Why not?
*  Why can't they?
*  Cause they're not good.
*  They don't have any, there's not even like a possible all star in this team house.
*  Well, Jordan Poole begs to differ.
*  And he's going to show you Jordan Poole is going to show you that, that he's
*  got, he was just, they were holding back Steve Kerr and Draymond were holding
*  back in Golden State.
*  I actually think Jordan Poole now that Dinwiddie looks like he's not going to
*  have the ball enough, Jordan Poole is going to be our number one, his teammates
*  hate playing with him guy.
*  That's my prediction.
*  I liked it.
*  I read an article on Hoops Hype that Danilo Gallinari said he couldn't
*  wait to play the Celtics.
*  Oh, revenge game with Gallo.
*  What are you mad about?
*  Yeah, they did tell him that he was staying.
*  How about Johnny Davis?
*  He didn't mention him.
*  He's an unmentionable house.
*  You missed on like five straight first round picks until Kula Bali.
*  It's a whole new thing.
*  We don't even know that that's a hit yet.
*  I, but I'm just at least giving it a do not know.
*  Kispert.
*  I kind of like Kispert, but didn't they take them like ninth?
*  Took them too high.
*  Yeah.
*  He could shoot though.
*  Rossello is this 2024 stealth trade machine team?
*  Feels like there's a lot of trade machine action with this team.
*  Yeah, but I don't know.
*  Like, what do I want?
*  I don't want Poole's contract.
*  And I don't know that I want Poole in a me against the world Tupac season.
*  You know, that's the other part.
*  I know.
*  And Kula Bali is going to do whatever he wants to do.
*  So based on watching him play, I like Gafford.
*  Kuzma has actually been pretty good for him, you know, and he got paid and maybe
*  there's something there, but yeah, I think a lot of teams will call about
*  Tyus Jones.
*  I think Poole's on the team the whole season, just for the record.
*  I think with that contract, if he plays really well though, and his shooting
*  percentages are close to what, because he shoots.
*  Right.
*  We keep them and maybe he's either a cornerstone piece as you grow.
*  I hate to break it to you.
*  His contract will be cheaper.
*  You're keeping him either way.
*  No, his contract is going to look good in a year.
*  If he's a cornerstone, you're keeping him.
*  If he's not a cornerstone, you're not going to be able to trade him.
*  I think they are going to be able to trade him.
*  The three people in your life for the next few years are your wife,
*  your son and Jordan Poole.
*  That's how it's going to play out.
*  I'll invite him over.
*  He can have Chipotle.
*  We like Chipotle at the house household.
*  I just don't see it.
*  I'm going hard under.
*  You're locking it?
*  Possible lock.
*  Fine.
*  Go ahead.
*  I don't think I'd lock it.
*  They get the pole position in the lottery with this team.
*  I don't see a worse team.
*  There's too many professional players.
*  They're over under.
*  You're comparing it to like Hinky Sixers experiments.
*  I think that's what's throwing you off here.
*  They're better than the Spurs.
*  They're going to be more competitive than Portland.
*  House, you're over under is four wins lower than every other team in the league.
*  I think that's a mispricing.
*  This is fascinating now.
*  We've got some serious wizards takes.
*  You think he's realistic with the wizards too.
*  I also think the other thing is that there's nothing here that's core.
*  There's nothing here that's like, hey, even with one Benyama, San Antonio, even
*  last year when they were tanking, they were still running stuff offensively.
*  They were like doing things.
*  I think Detroit actually planned on being a lot better than they were last year,
*  but then Cade goes down for the, there's not one guy in this wizard's roster where
*  I think they're going to be like, wow, we got to make sure we set the standard
*  immediately, even though it's a really good front office.
*  Who's your coach has?
*  Um, until junior.
*  Did you have to check?
*  No, I knew it was, I wanted to make sure I didn't say Bickerstaff because we had
*  a long run with Bickerstaff.
*  He's the other worst coach in the East.
*  West until junior is the worst coach in the East and then Bickerstaff is the
*  second worst coach in the East.
