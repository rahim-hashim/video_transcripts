*  We're, we're going away from the NBA. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=33.12s)]
*  We got summer league. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=34.84s)]
*  I don't really care. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=35.6s)]
*  Do you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=36.2s)]
*  No, I mean, I just seeing clips tonight as I was prepping this out, I'm like, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=37.88s)]
*  I can't, I can't do this right now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=43.44s)]
*  Somebody sent me a text last night about how edge comb looks so much better than [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=45.68s)]
*  Bailey and I was like, I need a break. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  I need a break. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=51.68s)]
*  I'm not ready for any of this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=52.32s)]
*  Uh, I do think the summer league, I'll, I'm sure I'll watch some of the clips [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=54.36s)]
*  and stuff, I'm not going to go. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  Um, but I just, I need a break that, that 17 day finals followed by the draft [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=60.32s)]
*  right after that, all the fridge. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=66.16s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, I need a, I need a reset. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Gotta start thinking about NFL. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  Did you start your prep yet? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  For NFL? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=72.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=74.76s)]
*  I need, I need a full, like I was going to go to summer league. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=75.88s)]
*  And then I realized I'm like, I'm not going to go to summer league. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=79.64s)]
*  110 degrees. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=83.88s)]
*  It was this unbelievable epiphany because the problem is it's too busy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=85.36s)]
*  It's too popular now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  And it's a great setup for families. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=89.44s)]
*  It's great for kids. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=91.64s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=92.52s)]
*  If you're a basketball junkie, the cost is great, but now the smaller gym, it's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  like really hard to find a spot. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=98.24s)]
*  And even if you have the media pass, it can be a pain if you're jumping back and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=99.88s)]
*  forth and you know, I think a lot of us that have been doing it for a bunch of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  years, there's different people with teams that you want to say hi to, but I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  don't blame them for never wanting to talk to us. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=109.16s)]
*  So they're all roped off now and it's been happening at the combine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=111.72s)]
*  So now, now you end up kind of like sitting by yourself, just watching [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=114.72s)]
*  basketball the whole time and you're not like somebody might wave to you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=118.92s)]
*  And then a kid in a security jacket. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=122.12s)]
*  It's like, what are you doing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=123.6s)]
*  So, um, I went, I went to Vegas too many times over the stretch of like F1, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=124.28s)]
*  super bowl, everything that we were doing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=129.64s)]
*  So I just realized the other day, I was like, Hey, you don't have to go. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=131.92s)]
*  I was like, perfect. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=136.44s)]
*  Summer league grew itself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=137.96s)]
*  Now we sound like the two old media guys complaining about traveling somewhere [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=139.56s)]
*  for a fun sporting event, but I'm with you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=143.28s)]
*  I don't want any part of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  And also it is really hot. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Like that Vegas hot that it hits in July when you leave the stadium and it's like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=149.6s)]
*  one 13 it's three in the afternoon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=153.88s)]
*  You're just like, why am I here? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=156.96s)]
*  What is this place? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=159.56s)]
*  But, uh, Cooper flag would be fun. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  I would, I'm sure Trey Johnson will have one heat check if he's there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=162.4s)]
*  Um, so some stuff happened since the last time we, we talked, um, the biggest, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=166.4s)]
*  the biggest thing is Whitmore Island. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=173.08s)]
*  Now house is involved because he went to Washington. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=175.08s)]
*  Um, there were a couple of guys that, you know, there's so many movement back [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=178.44s)]
*  and forth now with its contracts are shorter and just guys, it's almost impossible [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=182.76s)]
*  to get like all of a sudden Jay Huff's on Indiana. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, Oh, I kind of like that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=188.68s)]
*  Uh, Whitmore on the wizards, but Whitmore was one I was watching cause I, I'm [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=190.36s)]
*  still all in on that dude. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=195.52s)]
*  And I think in the right team in the right situation, that guy is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=197.4s)]
*  instant offense off the bench. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=200.56s)]
*  I don't know if Washington's the right team or not, but I do like some of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  the assets they're collecting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=205.44s)]
*  We're going to talk about them in a second with a gimmick, but, uh, that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  was one of my favorites. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=210.08s)]
*  Did you have a favorite? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=210.88s)]
*  Oh, I'm so glad that guy's on that team. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=212.56s)]
*  Do you have any of those like the lower level ones? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=214.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I even, I even post on threads about Jay Huff. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's where, that's where, you know, I'm really like locked in. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Like it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  Uh, I saw him. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  I went to go see McClung play for the South Bay Lakers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's a fun Thursday night, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=232.52s)]
*  But I noticed a lot of Jay Huff. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=235.0s)]
*  And then when Jay Huff was with Memphis, I'm like, you know, this guy might be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=237.12s)]
*  the prototype of that stretch five. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=240.84s)]
*  Everybody's looking at maybe not the protection on the other side, but yeah, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  when I saw that Pacers, what they gave up, I'm like, great. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=245.68s)]
*  Love the Jay Huff acquisition Pacers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=249.08s)]
*  Are they back? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=251.72s)]
*  Another one Pacers? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=252.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=253.52s)]
*  They could, they might be able to patch together some miles Turner stats. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=253.68s)]
*  The Halburn thing is going to be a little more insurmountable. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=256.52s)]
*  There's a couple of decent guys left. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=259.44s)]
*  I'm intrigued by Ryan Rollins seeing where he ends up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=261.76s)]
*  We're at that level of free. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=265.0s)]
*  It's just there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=266.4s)]
*  I'm like, I wonder who can snare Ryan Rollins. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=267.08s)]
*  Um, look, but we should say the cam went more thing for a second. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=270.04s)]
*  Cause I, I agree with everything you said, but I don't know if he should be someone [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=272.96s)]
*  you're ever describing as being all in on a guy, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  Cause I think we kind of know what the downside to him is too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=286.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=287.28s)]
*  I mean, if you're talking. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=287.55999999999995s)]
*  I don't know where a bench guy that could do a little like what math [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  Warren was doing in the, uh, in the playoffs a couple of times. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=294.08s)]
*  I think that's the upside for him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  Um, I think the wizards, I like all this stuff they're doing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  There's some teams that I really do not like, which we're going to talk about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=302.2s)]
*  in a second, but, um, from a big picture standpoint, okay. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  See is the heavy favorites. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=310.32s)]
*  And then there's a bunch of contenders after that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=311.76s)]
*  And the odds are really interesting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=314.6s)]
*  Do you know who has the second best odds on Fandota win the title right now? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Houston. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=319.64s)]
*  It's the New York Knicks. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=320.88s)]
*  They are now seven 50. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=325.0s)]
*  Houston, Denver and Cleveland are all plus eight 50. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  They're three, four, five. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=328.12s)]
*  And I think that's the consensus top five. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=330.04s)]
*  I Minnesota 17 to one. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=332.56s)]
*  I personally would have Minnesota in there as a top six. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=335.0s)]
*  Um, but I think because they lost Alexander Walker and maybe they made [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=338.44s)]
*  conference finals two years in a row, but I still feel like Minnesota [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=342.72s)]
*  should be in that combo. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=345.72s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=347.48s)]
*  No, I, this is the overreaction to the new stuff. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Cause I've seen Houston. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=353.88s)]
*  I think Houston was second best odds for a little while. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  And then the next, the Yabba Yabba, Sally just swung it and you get that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=358.6s)]
*  guy's your seventh man. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=363.68s)]
*  By the way, Philly, this time it's personal was Yabba Sally. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=365.08s)]
*  He was like, they offered me 2 million. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Um, yeah, it was like, he was like, it's like they wanted me to leave. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=370.44s)]
*  They were like driving me to the airport trying to get rid of me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=373.52s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=376.6s)]
*  I really like Yabba Sally. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=377.04s)]
*  I actually thought he would have been interesting Laker signing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=378.56s)]
*  I think the Nixon done a really good job in like, it was, it was fun for them to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=382.4s)]
*  be thinking we just need to add like two or three guys that can actually play in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=386.56s)]
*  a top eight rotation for a good team and not have a cost a lot. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=389.92s)]
*  And this is something I was saying with Bobby marks on Thursday's pod is that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  Really good. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=397.76s)]
*  By the way. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=398.2s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=399.12s)]
*  It feels like you're going to love this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=399.64s)]

*  The old Belichick free agency period where he was like, go ahead, everybody [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=404.56s)]
*  spend all your money, spend all your cap space to your guaranteed $60 million [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=408.16s)]
*  deals, we're just going to hang out here in the back. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=411.72s)]
*  Now, I think part of that success we realized too, was that he was a great [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  defensive coach and Brady fixed all of their offensive limitations, but he would [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=417.92s)]
*  shop in this bargain base because there'd always be all these guys left. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=422.08s)]
*  And you'd be like, well, how was this guy 20 million guaranteed? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=425.4s)]
*  And this guy's like a $2.7 million guy for like one year with incentives. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=427.84s)]
*  I am wondering if, if you're like a pretty good team and granted you're up [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=432.96s)]
*  against the cap wise, if the advantage now with everything we're seeing with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=436.84s)]
*  the first and second aprons is just like, Hey, we can pick off. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=440.56s)]
*  Like if you're getting a top eight minutes guy on a good team for free. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=443.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=448.88s)]
*  And I mean free in the sense of like what free is for an NBA investment, you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=449.56s)]
*  know, one year, less than 10 million. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=453.68s)]
*  Uh, I wonder if that's something I'm wondering if that market is going to be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=456.0s)]
*  where teams feel like, Hey, we can just wait around and grab somebody instead of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=458.8s)]
*  grabbing our first or second choice. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=462.56s)]
*  There were some stunning salaries. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  Like I thought, I thought Gary Trent with some of the stuff he did in the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=467.0s)]
*  playoffs had at least earned his way into maybe like a two years, 15, two years, 16. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=471.16s)]
*  The bucks like kind of stole them and brought them back, you know, well, I'll [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=476.24s)]
*  save it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=480.64s)]
*  I have a whole bucks thing I want to do, but they, they have been able to patch [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=481.08s)]
*  together some salaries combined with the fact that they got Turner maybe for a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  little less than I think everybody thought he would go for a free agency. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think they have two moves left to your point that it's like this bargain [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=493.68s)]
*  shopping, maybe you can grab a guy here or there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=496.96s)]
*  The ones that I don't understand, because I agree with what you said is when [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  teams are paying like 15 million a year for Schroeder, you know, or even like [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  Duncan one year 16, and then the second year you have an option, you have to buy [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=507.6s)]
*  it out. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  But, um, I, that was what I, to me, you don't have to pay double figures for [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=511.6s)]
*  guys that aren't impact starters anymore. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=517.2s)]
*  The market seems to be somewhere between five and 10, or you could trade for a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=519.84s)]
*  house or contract. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=524.4s)]
*  That's what made the nets that Terrence man signing so strained or trade. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=525.6s)]
*  It was like, Oh cool. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=529.6s)]
*  It was like, Oh cool. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=531.16s)]
*  We get Terrence man for 46 million for the next three years. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  Like that's just not what the market would be for him. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=535.04s)]
*  If he was in the market, you're seeing it with somebody like coming to two [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  where teams don't even know. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=540.64s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if that'll be resolved by the time people hear this, but [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=542.88s)]
*  they coming to things crazy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=547.64s)]
*  That's somebody that over the years would have been at least three for 70. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  Somebody would have taken a fire and I had no idea what he's going to get. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=552.88s)]
*  That seems a little high, but yeah, you'd think somebody would at least [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=557.12s)]
*  just send out some kind of offer sheet. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=560.48s)]
*  But if Brooklyn, I mean, it was just such a weird summer too, because it was like, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=562.96s)]
*  what's Brooklyn going to do? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=565.88s)]
*  What's Brooklyn going to do? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=566.84s)]
*  And it's like, well, you know what? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=568.52s)]
*  They're not going to do spend it on a player. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  They want, they're going to take an asset and the man contract, uh, the Porter [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=571.36s)]
*  junior deal, you know, I know it's an unprotected and 32 for that, but you know, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=575.52s)]
*  I was thinking about this. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=580.76s)]
*  I'm like, once you've had to give up a pick just to get off of Porter junior at [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=581.84s)]
*  like 80 million the next two years. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=585.48s)]
*  This is going to be one of the things I brought up to you today. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  What if they had offered? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  No, what if they had offered Brooklyn? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  Here's Michael Porter. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=593.48s)]
*  We'll give you our 2032 first, just absorb him into the cap space. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=595.6400000000001s)]
*  Like, do the nets do that? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, clearly they would have done it because they gave him cam Johnson. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  That's the thing was like, they have to even put cam Johnson in the trade. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  I just think that trade, the more I thought about it over the last five days, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=613.6s)]
*  I'm like, that's one of the worst trades of the decade that you have to, you have [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=617.4s)]
*  to attach a pick to get rid of Porter. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=622.76s)]
*  And I also didn't get anything for cam Johnson. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=625.12s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=627.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=629.36s)]
*  Cause that's Sam. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=629.5600000000001s)]
*  Glad. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=630.52s)]
*  I'm glad we hadn't talked about this at all because when it happened, it was like [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=630.84s)]
*  just, oh yeah, this makes sense. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=634.36s)]
*  And it's cam Johnson and he, and then at first it was like, I love cam Johnson [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=635.6s)]
*  way more than I like Porter junior for a bunch of reasons. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=639.88s)]
*  Then he costs half as much. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=643.76s)]
*  And so you're like, what's the cam Johnson trade if you're trying to acquire a good [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=645.92s)]
*  player, like, isn't there a piece? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=651.0s)]
*  And then this is classic, like salary cap dumping for the asset, which is what [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=653.32s)]
*  Brooklyn's whole approach was. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=658.84s)]
*  And I just felt like there should have been a second asset with this because they [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  were giving up a player. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  Other teams would have liked while also taking on Porter junior who had the worst [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=665.72s)]
*  contract. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=669.32s)]
*  So maybe their point is that with Porter junior, they'll be able to flip them in a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=669.76s)]
*  year at 40 million and then get an asset on the way back. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=672.96s)]
*  That's the only thing I could, I could fathom them saying bad with, with the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  explanation of it all. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=681.2s)]
*  I thought it was a miracle trade for the nuggets when it happened. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=682.72s)]
*  And the more I thought about her over the last four days, I was thinking like, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=685.72s)]
*  think about over the years, teams adding pick, going back to the Kurt Thomas days, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=689.72s)]
*  teams adding picks to dump a contract, to try to reset their salary structure in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  some way. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  Porter, I didn't think was tradable unless you took like a Bradley Beale or, you [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=701.1600000000001s)]
*  know, 78 million for two years. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=706.32s)]
*  He's a bad back. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=707.8800000000001s)]
*  He's a fucked up shoulder. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=709.24s)]
*  Um, I just think he's a 15 to $20 million player. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=710.96s)]
*  I mean, he was good in the 2023 finals. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not like he hasn't had good moments, but for them, he was a complete impediment [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=716.8800000000001s)]
*  to making their roster better because they couldn't touch Murray. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=721.44s)]
*  They couldn't touch Brown, couldn't touch Jokic. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=724.2800000000001s)]
*  Um, they, it's just, and they couldn't touch Gordon. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=727.3599999999999s)]
*  So what, how else were they going to improve the roster? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=730.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=732.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  Here comes, here comes Brooklyn. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=733.56s)]
*  They're like, what if we just, we just need one pick and we'll save 70. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=735.3599999999999s)]
*  I was fucking crazy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=739.88s)]
*  I think they could have taken Porter's thing, gotten a pick and traded Cam Johnson [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=741.8s)]
*  and ended up with way more. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=747.0799999999999s)]
*  And I, I continue to think they did an awful job, like really bad. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=748.4s)]
*  I didn't like their draft. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=752.76s)]
*  I don't like really any of that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't think they have like an awesome kickass asset. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=755.56s)]
*  Um, their best asset is basically their own pick in 2026, which they traded to get back. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=758.5999999999999s)]
*  But, uh, I just don't understand anything they did. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=763.92s)]
*  They had all that cap space. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  I said this to Rob Mahoney on Wednesday. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=768.8s)]
*  They were the guy in the fantasy draft that had a hundred dollars to spend with 10 and, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=771.7199999999999s)]
*  and everybody else ran out of money. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  They were in the driver's seat in all these different ways. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=778.04s)]
*  I just don't think they exploited it correctly. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=780.68s)]
*  I don't like what they did. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, it must have been that there just weren't that many teams that were going to give up an [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=784.0s)]
*  asset to also park stuff to get off a cap space. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=787.24s)]
*  But for Denver, it's just perfect for Denver on top of the other things they get to do and bringing [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=789.6s)]
*  it like full circle to the odds. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=795.48s)]
*  Like Denver should be, Denver should be more of a favorite for an MBA title than Houston [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=797.24s)]
*  should be. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=801.48s)]
*  I said that on Wednesday. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=802.84s)]
*  That's the game. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=804.84s)]
*  No, I just said on Wednesday, they were nine to one on Wednesday. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=805.6s)]
*  I'm like, that's the best bet. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=808.48s)]
*  I think they should have the second best odds. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=810.44s)]
*  I think it'll be five to one by the time we start the season. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=812.36s)]
*  It looks like Mark Stein was reporting that they convinced Valenshuenis to stay for a year. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=819.5200000000001s)]
*  It seems like they have one more move that they can make. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=819.96s)]
*  They're under the apron, so they have flexibility during the season and they just have a [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=822.6s)]
*  better team. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=826.24s)]
*  Cam Johnson is going to be better for them than Michael Porter was. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=826.9200000000001s)]
*  He's going to be, I just think a better health bet for nine months. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=829.24s)]
*  He's just a better foxhole guy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=834.0400000000001s)]
*  I think too. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=835.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=835.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, that's, that's my biggest thing with Porter Jr. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=835.96s)]
*  Like it is impressive, man, when he's, when he's, when he's, when he's, when he's, when he's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=838.24s)]
*  six, 10, he's pulling up and he's hitting these shots off the dribble. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=841.84s)]
*  And you're like, this is ridiculous. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=845.32s)]
*  But then there's just a nicer, you're like, oh, I guess this guy's just totally out of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  it tonight. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  And yeah, you know, for somebody who's been in the league as long as he's been in the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=850.6s)]
*  league. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=853.48s)]
*  And it is also interesting too, like when we were going through, and I know you probably [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=854.2s)]
*  spent a good chunk of your Sunday doing what I was doing in preparation for this, but [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  looking at all the extensions, looking at all the contracts and like the best thing you [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  can be is in that Patrick Williams stretch of like, we're still not sure, but man, we'd [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=865.12s)]
*  hate to be wrong. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=869.72s)]
*  So here's your 90 million and Porter Jr. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=870.84s)]
*  Kills it because it's like, hey, you've been hurt, but God, you're so talented and you're [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=875.72s)]
*  so tall and you're such a good shooter and we don't really have other moves. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=880.84s)]
*  And we're also kind of cheap sometimes, but like that window of like, like, look, the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=884.52s)]
*  best thing is to be awesome and then get the max extension, right? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=889.9200000000001s)]
*  Like a kid, Cunningham or something like that, even though, okay, you know, it took a little [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=892.9200000000001s)]
*  bit longer maybe. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=896.2s)]
*  And that's just another reminder. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=897.48s)]
*  We should maybe look at these point guards coming up through the draft and realize, you [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=898.56s)]
*  know, it might take these guys a little bit longer than being the finished like asset [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=901.3199999999999s)]
*  that you'd want. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=904.88s)]
*  But when you're like that top pick and you don't know, those are the contracts where [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=905.88s)]
*  now you're looking at it going, I can't like you said, Kaminga 70, like Kaminga might be [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=913.3599999999999s)]
*  not even like a full mid-level guy because there's also it's pretty clear, too. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=920.16s)]
*  I think there's enough teams that look at what her does and what Golden State does. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=924.0s)]
*  And I'm sure Kaminga, it's driven him crazy and his reps crazy there. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=928.2800000000001s)]
*  But I don't think Golden State's like hiding this amazing steady player from the rest of [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  the league either with the way that they've yo-yoed him and out of the line. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=936.84s)]
*  He's probably a good stats, bad team guy, ultimately. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=940.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of guys like that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Giddies Giddies, the weirdest one to me because. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=946.36s)]
*  I still really like him and he's young and he's had some success and I think he's [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=951.1600000000001s)]
*  competitive. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=955.16s)]
*  And I think for the most part, he's a winning player and his shot might get better as he [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=956.8s)]
*  gets older. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=960.6s)]
*  It was really good in the second half. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  It's something to build on, something to be happy about. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=963.88s)]
*  I don't know if it's real. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=966.3199999999999s)]

*  Worst roster situations for each conference. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1040.44s)]

*  explain it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1047.96s)]
*  We talked about this maybe a month ago when we argued about who does Indiana [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1049.32s)]
*  now have the best roster situation in the East. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1054.92s)]
*  And we went back and forth. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1058.4s)]
*  You settled on Cleveland. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1059.64s)]

*  Now I think Cleveland you'd probably pick, but going the other way with the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1069.96s)]
*  worst, it's a good time to talk about it because we just had free agency. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1073.8s)]

*  What's yours? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1104.2s)]
*  Uh, man, just, just give me 20 seconds on it because there's like, sometimes it's [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1106.72s)]
*  Hey, who's the best player on these four bad teams because that's kind of the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1113.24s)]
*  most important part. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1117.64s)]
*  So what do you care the most? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1119.28s)]
*  So if you have a great player, does that excuse some of the other stuff that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1120.68s)]
*  would make you nervous? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1124.4s)]
*  Like the Milwaukee situation. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1125.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1126.92s)]
*  Do you have like one player? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  Because we could do the same thing in the West and I'm going to head over [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1130.52s)]
*  so it's cause like, it's like, is it all flexibility? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1132.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it all cap space? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1134.88s)]
*  Is it all draft assets? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1135.92s)]
*  So I got to tell you, like, if you're telling me the next, the next four years, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  five years, I don't want to be Toronto. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't want to be Toronto because even though Scotty Barnes is better [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1146.68s)]
*  than some of the other teams, best players, it's 38 and a half million for him. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1150.44s)]
*  It's 38 million for Brandon Ingram. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1155.0s)]
*  It's 32 and a half million for quickly. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1156.56s)]
*  It's 28 million for RJ Barrett. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1158.44s)]
*  Pertle who's fine, you know, 20 million. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1160.88s)]
*  That's going to go up with the extension. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1162.8s)]
*  They just extended him for another three. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1164.68s)]
*  They have five for, he's basically five for one 14. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1166.88s)]
*  Now you want to argue last year, Ingram didn't play RJ didn't crack 60 games. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1170.2s)]
*  Pearl didn't crack 60 games quickly played 33. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1175.0s)]
*  Scotty Barnes only played 65. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1177.92s)]
*  I think there's some Scotty Barnes numbers that are going in the wrong [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1179.6s)]
*  direction in an alarming way, but I'm not ready to just write him off as like [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1182.36s)]
*  somebody who's going to now like his best year ever was the second year. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1186.52s)]
*  And now it's all downhill. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1190.04s)]
*  So that doesn't seem entirely fair. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1191.0s)]
*  So even though I like Barnes better, there's, there's no moves here really for [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1192.24s)]
*  Toronto and all of these players other than RJ are under contract for the next three years. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1197.6799999999998s)]
*  I had them third on my list. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1203.48s)]
*  I don't like their, their top five guys. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1206.4s)]
*  I don't like any of the contracts for the top five. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1209.88s)]
*  And they did that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1212.24s)]
*  So they did that Ingram move where that before the trade deadline, they traded [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1212.92s)]
*  some of the stuff they got for the Siachen trade forum, and then they gave him this [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1218.56s)]
*  extension of three years, 120, so 40 a year. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  And then we get to the summer and like Nazarit's going for 25 miles. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1225.8400000000001s)]
*  Turner's going for 24. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1230.44s)]
*  And now it just feels like they shot their gun in a major way on that one. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1232.64s)]
*  And what does Brandon Ingram get in July? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1237.3200000000002s)]
*  If they hadn't done that extension, they must've been freaked that Ingram was the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1240.64s)]
*  only like big time scoring wing, but you know, Ingram's another one of those guys [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1245.92s)]
*  that he'll get you the 20, but I just don't know, like, are you going to give me 20 [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1251.8000000000002s)]
*  in a big spot? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1257.8000000000002s)]
*  You're going to give me 28 in a big spot. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1258.5200000000002s)]
*  If I need you to be the number one scoring option, because there's some times [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1260.44s)]
*  in some big games where I feel like the guy gets pushed around. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1263.72s)]
*  So I'm thinking Toronto went, there's no good free agents. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1265.52s)]
*  And what if Brooklyn goes, but that's where you kind of have to go, Hey, Brooklyn, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1269.96s)]
*  Brooklyn wants to give him another 40 million a year when he's hurt. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1274.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1278.28s)]
*  Then, then maybe we have to take that risk. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1278.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't know if that's why I'm a size not there anymore. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1281.64s)]
*  If they eventually were like, okay, we're paying you 15 million a year to run this [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1284.16s)]
*  team and now you're spending, they're doing a lot of a level spending on like [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1287.76s)]
*  B minus guys. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1292.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1294.08s)]
*  I think. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1294.32s)]
*  Did Mahoney say that somebody said this on my pod that they were top 12 just for [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1296.04s)]
*  salaries in the league, but you wouldn't say they had a top 12 roster. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1301.44s)]
*  It's kind of not where you want to be. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1305.96s)]
*  I thought the Ingram thing was an overpay. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1307.56s)]
*  I wouldn't want to pay Barrett 29 million a year quickly is 32 and a half years or [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1310.2s)]
*  32 and a half million each year for the next four. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1315.76s)]
*  Where in a league where like Clarkson's getting bought out and you're just, you're [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  Callum sexting gets traded for NERC edge. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1323.88s)]
*  You have to attach a pick. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1325.84s)]
*  He's making 19 million. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1326.96s)]
*  So you think of that and it's like, that contract's awful. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1328.64s)]
*  I, I was on the record. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1331.28s)]
*  I didn't like the Barnes Max extension. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1332.72s)]
*  I understand what they had to do. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  He's going to get it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1335.28s)]
*  Like, I don't think he's going to get it for the bonds one. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just, that does make me feel good. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1339.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1341.68s)]
*  But as we were talking about, like the best thing is, is almost that rookie [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1342.0s)]
*  extension, that first rookie extension. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1346.24s)]
*  Cause you're like worried you might be wrong. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1347.92s)]
*  Like the Knicks didn't want to do this quickly number now. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1350.04s)]
*  And then they get OG out. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1353.44s)]
*  Now I don't know if there's a ton of teams that wanted to pay OG 200 million [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1354.92s)]
*  either because they are afraid of this injury history on top of everything else. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1358.52s)]
*  So, you know, maybe there's an argument here where it's like, Hey, you and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1361.6s)]
*  Bill are completely wrong because this is more stable. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1365.0s)]
*  You know who your five guys are. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1367.88s)]
*  They didn't even play that many games last year together for whatever reason. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1369.68s)]
*  Five guys together. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1373.0s)]
*  Barnes Ingram quickly Baird and Pertle. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1374.6s)]
*  I would say I'd rather, the reason I picked them is I'd rather have worse [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1377.8s)]
*  talent and have more options the next two years, because I don't have any [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1381.48s)]
*  options with this unless Barnes turns into a superstar. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1385.44s)]
*  I like Grady Dick. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1389.04s)]
*  I think he he's a rotation guy. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1390.6s)]
*  Murray, Murray Bowles can't speak. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1392.4s)]
*  Murray Boyle, Murray Bowles. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1395.4s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1399.52s)]
*  Walter, some people like. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1400.92s)]
*  Agbaji had some moments. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1402.6s)]
*  Agbaji's expensive too. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1404.72s)]
*  But he had some moments. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1407.24s)]
*  Um, they have all their firsts. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1408.4s)]
*  I had them third. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1410.08s)]
*  My number one was Chicago. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1411.24s)]
*  I stared at it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1413.2s)]
*  They still have this giddy RFA. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1414.92s)]
*  This is your least favorite one. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1416.48s)]
*  Yeah, here's why. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1418.6s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1419.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1420.36s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1421.76s)]
*  I don't love a single guy in their roster. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1422.8s)]
*  Maybe Bud Zelis. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1425.32s)]
*  Like at gunpoint. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1427.48s)]
*  I like Bud Zelis. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1428.72s)]
*  I don't, is he going to make it on NBA team? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1430.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1432.04s)]
*  Um, they have $85 million in expirings this season. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1433.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1437.2s)]
*  So you think like, Oh, look out for the bulls summer of 2026. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1437.84s)]
*  They just never been that team. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1442.16s)]
*  We've never seen it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1443.52s)]
*  They didn't pay the luxury tax in forever. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1444.68s)]
*  Um, they have all their firsts. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't, yeah, it's a small market, big market team. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1449.28s)]
*  I didn't like their first round pick this year. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1451.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why they didn't make the dare queen. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  The Red Sox are like, what's the issue? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1454.72s)]
*  The Red Sox are like, I like what the bulls are doing. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1457.4s)]
*  I thought they should have made the dare queen trade. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1459.96s)]
*  Move back 11 spots, get, get new ones as first round pick. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  But, uh, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1465.68s)]
*  it all depends on which version of the Derek queen trade you were offered is I [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1467.8400000000001s)]
*  think what the lesson is. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll never, we'll never know the answer is like, yeah, we would have done that. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1472.2s)]
*  If we had known it was unprotected, but we'll see, we'll see. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1475.76s)]
*  It'll be written in the books. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1478.96s)]
*  Um, Colby whites about to be a free agent. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1480.72s)]
*  That scares me. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1484.84s)]
*  Like what, what is his next contract? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1485.76s)]
*  Uh, that Patrick Williams in a Coro six, four for 72 for Williams, two for 22 for [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1488.56s)]
*  a Coro, they have some expirience, but I just don't know what this team is. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1495.1999999999998s)]
*  Like what's, where am I going the next three years? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1499.24s)]
*  I know I'm not going to be like a bottom five team next year. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'll get lucky when the lottery, but, um, it's just, it just seems bleak to [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1505.7199999999998s)]
*  me. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1510.24s)]
*  Who am I selling to my face? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1511.8s)]
*  If I'm a bulls fan, what am I excited about? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1512.8s)]
*  My owners have already made it very clear to me. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1515.2s)]
*  We're never going to really spend money. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1517.6s)]
*  Um, I don't think free agents are going to be like, man, I'd love to go to Chicago. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1519.6399999999999s)]
*  They've done a shitty job with the Jordan legacy where you never hear a [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1523.48s)]
*  poor be like, I want to go to Chicago and reinvigorate the bulls. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1526.8799999999999s)]
*  That team really meant something. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  I just don't really know what this team is other than a team that's going to go [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1532.6s)]
*  40 and 42 every year. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1535.84s)]
*  So that's my number one pick. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1537.52s)]
*  Yeah, this play in stretch where they just lose to Miami every year. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1538.76s)]
*  Like, yeah, you'd go through it and you're like, this is, this is kind of [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1541.84s)]
*  the same thing over and over again. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1544.92s)]
*  Uh, I think the Giddy trade will turn out to be a good trade for them. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1546.84s)]
*  You know, at the time they get killed, they don't get a draft pick, especially [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1551.4s)]
*  it's okay. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1554.8s)]
*  See, you know, it works for okay. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1555.32s)]
*  See perfectly. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1556.8s)]
*  Yeah, we defended them. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1557.6s)]
*  I think we're in the minority. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1558.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1560.08s)]
*  But Giddy was also like not super popular at the time either. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1560.4s)]
*  So it wasn't like there was going to be a bunch of people sticking up for him. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  But yeah, the rest of the roster, I think at least the Bezellas piece, that's kind [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1566.36s)]
*  of what I would look for in this too is like, there's, there's some unknown. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1570.72s)]
*  That's exciting. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1573.92s)]
*  Like I would give you points for that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1575.12s)]
*  And at least Bezellas is in that and, um, the Sangay, if you like what you saw [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1577.2s)]
*  from him in the bundas Liga, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1584.32s)]
*  Frank, Frank, Fran, for Shella just going in on him. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1588.24s)]
*  I really enjoyed it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1590.72s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1591.48s)]
*  Every once in a while, Fran just goes nuts on the foreign, on the foreign players. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1592.12s)]
*  He was like, here's a guy who quit on his team played four minutes. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1596.24s)]
*  Uh, anyway, I did think that was pretty shocking, man, that he would just bail. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1601.6799999999998s)]
*  And then you would hurt, all of us had heard about it for like a week. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1606.12s)]
*  I'm sure you heard about it too. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1609.4399999999998s)]
*  And then no one had said anything and everybody was like, is he really going [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1611.32s)]
*  to do this? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1614.04s)]
*  Is he really going to go to the draft while his team is playing for him? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1614.6s)]
*  And then he would just go to the draft and then he would just go to the draft. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1617.4399999999998s)]
*  While his team is playing for championship. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1620.88s)]
*  And it's like the reason he's coming to the draft is because clearly the team has [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1623.0s)]
*  told him whichever team it is in the lottery, like we're taking you and it [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1625.92s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1629.3200000000002s)]
*  They, they didn't care that he wasn't going to play. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1630.4s)]
*  Um, so I don't know. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1633.76s)]
*  GM, would you make promises? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1634.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think, I think it's part of it. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1638.3600000000001s)]
*  I know you probably think you wouldn't, but would you do promises with, with [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1639.72s)]
*  caveats? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1643.76s)]
*  Well, what do you do if you make a promise to him at 12 and then Troy Weaver [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  calls you and says, yo, we really want to move up. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1649.88s)]
*  We'll give you 23 in our unprotected pick next year for number 12. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1655.0400000000002s)]
*  And you're like, fuck, I made this promise to this French guy. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1659.7600000000002s)]
*  I can't. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  I just wouldn't. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  That's, I think that's the whole reason you don't do promises because you never [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1666.2800000000002s)]
*  know and Troy Weaver is calling you with some fucking asinine trade that you have [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1671.2s)]
*  to accept. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1674.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1676.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's where you could say, Hey, you have a promise unless, you know, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1676.44s)]
*  something comes down the pike. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1680.16s)]
*  But then I think most GMs would tell you how many clients does the guy have. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1681.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1687.28s)]
*  But what's, but what's the upside of the promise that if you're worried that [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1687.92s)]
*  he's going to keep working out and then he'll move into the top 10, you won't be [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1691.2s)]
*  able to get him like you have to think that guy is incredible at that point. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1694.72s)]
*  They didn't, they'd have to think he's like a potential all NBA guy and just [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1698.48s)]
*  lock in on somebody that far away from the job. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1701.8s)]
*  I just wouldn't do it. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1704.92s)]
*  I don't get the upside. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1706.52s)]
*  I've heard about teams going back to the agent going, Hey, something changed. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1709.3600000000001s)]
*  Can we get out of the promise? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1712.8s)]
*  And then the teams won't do it if the agent's going to lose, lose his shit about [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1714.92s)]
*  it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1719.0s)]
*  I'm sure other stuff has happened. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, I'm sure there's millions of stories I haven't heard, but when, um, like it [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1720.72s)]
*  was funny, there was a guy, there was a team that had a pick, but then their [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1726.28s)]
*  agents were saying that their guy was going there. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1731.2s)]
*  So like that was one of the rumors, like two weeks before the draft, it's like, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1734.24s)]
*  Hey, this guy has a lock. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1737.7600000000002s)]
*  He's promised here. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what, that's what everybody's saying. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1740.3200000000002s)]
*  And the pick got traded. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  So it was like, Oh Jesus. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1743.7600000000002s)]
*  So either it was a conditional promise, kind of like what we're talking about [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1745.2s)]
*  here, or that guy was just full of shit the whole time and was trying to get [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1749.24s)]
*  people to maybe take the guy even higher than the slot. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1754.24s)]
*  So it's all part of it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1756.8400000000001s)]
*  I have a little 45 second monologue for you about the bulls. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1759.0800000000002s)]
*  Good. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1762.68s)]
*  So I wrote in podcast about this in the early 2010s when the warriors were for [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1763.88s)]
*  sale, I can't remember their owner. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1768.88s)]
*  I think his name was like Chris Cohen. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1770.72s)]
*  Wasn't that his name? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1772.3200000000002s)]
*  So the guy who was sold and he sold to, uh, Lake and the price was high and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1773.5200000000002s)]
*  people was like 360 and people were like, Oh my God, that's a lot. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1779.24s)]
*  And I went all in on, I think that's a great deal. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1782.72s)]
*  I think this is one of the best markets in the league. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1786.24s)]
*  I think their fans really give a shit. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1788.8000000000002s)]
*  I think their fans really give a shit. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1790.92s)]
*  And this has been a misused under owned asset that if the right ownership group [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1793.08s)]
*  comes in, they could really turn this into a major thing. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1798.72s)]
*  Well, you were there in the, in Boston, the early two thousands with the Red [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1802.0s)]
*  Sox, when it was just like that. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1805.84s)]
*  It was this misused, terribly owned asset that everybody thought like, if [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1808.4s)]
*  somebody can come in and do this correctly, there's this amazing fan base [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1813.16s)]
*  ready to pay any amount of money and everyone will go to the games. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1818.92s)]
*  Everyone's going to the games anyway. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1822.3200000000002s)]
*  Like if the right ownership group figures this out, holy shit. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1823.52s)]
*  I think the bulls are like that. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1827.8000000000002s)]
*  I think this has been it criminally misused asset for really since Jordan [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1829.96s)]
*  left when instead of going for the seventh title, they said, Oh no, we're [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  going to rebuild, we're smarter than everybody. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1840.28s)]
*  And from that moment on, all they did was cheap out. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1842.16s)]
*  And, um, and basically they're in the third biggest city. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1845.5600000000002s)]
*  They're just cashing all this revenue that you get from being in Chicago, all [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1850.2s)]
*  of these people, these generations of people that grew up on the Jordan's [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1854.48s)]
*  bulls or remember the great days. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1857.64s)]
*  And so they keep their tickets and just kind of wait for something good to [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1859.48s)]
*  happen and nothing good is going to happen with these owners. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1863.8000000000002s)]
*  And I just feel like if I was like a kajillionaire, that would be the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  team I would try to buy. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1870.24s)]
*  Cause if you can reignite that team and rebuild them and tap into the Jordan [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1871.36s)]
*  DNA and Pippen and the, you know, bring those guys back and give Jordan a [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1876.68s)]
*  ceremonial position and really like ignite it, I think that would be a [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1880.68s)]
*  really special franchise. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1884.28s)]
*  And right now it's not, I think it's the worst situation in the East. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1885.56s)]
*  End of monologue. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1889.08s)]
*  Agree with all of it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1891.76s)]
*  I do wonder what Jordan relationship would be because if he wanted to like [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1892.6399999999999s)]
*  hang out in the draft room on draft night, have him put it, be like, Hey [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1896.16s)]
*  Mike, we're not going to do this. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1898.96s)]
*  He's like, let me tell you about the Kwame Brown night. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1902.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1904.36s)]
*  We like, Hey man, you can have all the gear in the world. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1905.24s)]
*  You have some cigars. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1909.76s)]
*  I blow the smoke. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1910.96s)]
*  You're allowed to smoke inside. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1911.92s)]
*  You can have a golf cart wherever you want to go. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1915.04s)]
*  We just don't want a ton of input on draft night based on the, uh, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1917.32s)]
*  the scouting reports. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1920.84s)]
*  Here's 5% of the team. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1921.76s)]
*  Just go to, go to some games and be an ambassador for us. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1923.08s)]
*  But I think that's like a seven, eight billion dollar franchise. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1927.28s)]
*  Just sitting there. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1931.72s)]
*  Chicago is a massive city. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1932.72s)]
*  Like think about what's happened with the Cubs. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1934.8s)]
*  Think about like the bear. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1936.56s)]
*  Think about the fans. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1937.6s)]
*  Think about the people we both know from Chicago. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1938.48s)]
*  It's, I just can't believe they're this mediocre every year. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1941.4399999999998s)]
*  So you're on record right now saying you would rather have every other [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1945.36s)]
*  roster situation in the East ahead of Chicago. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1949.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1952.48s)]
*  Because I'm including the ownership situation. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1952.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1955.72s)]
*  I just don't, the only thing they have is the potential cap space a year [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1956.8s)]
*  from now and I don't think they'll give a shit. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1960.32s)]
*  So I have Chicago when you have Toronto number one, where'd you have [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1962.32s)]
*  Chicago in your rankings? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1965.24s)]
*  Were they in top four? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1966.8s)]
*  No, because. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1968.8s)]
*  So who do you have second? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1971.48s)]
*  Well, this is where it becomes kind of like a debate of like is Washington's [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1974.6799999999998s)]
*  most valuable asset right now, Trey Johnson, that seems a little weird. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1980.9199999999998s)]
*  He's never played. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1985.72s)]
*  And yet we both like everything they're doing. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1988.76s)]
*  I like everything they're doing, but I mean, I wouldn't still a lot of [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1991.6s)]
*  other rosters I would rather have. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1997.9199999999998s)]
*  So you would rather have Chicago's roster and situation over, over [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1999.96s)]
*  Washington's roster and situation. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2005.12s)]
*  Cause I think I, to me, no way. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2006.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that's crazy. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2009.1599999999999s)]
*  I would so much rather be Washington. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2010.2s)]
*  But there's not really, yeah, there's just not a lot on the team though. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2011.68s)]
*  Like you want to sell me on 110 million and expiring contracts next year. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2015.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2019.8400000000001s)]
*  So we just saw Brooklyn do that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2022.96s)]
*  Middleton, smart homes, McCollum, Malinick, all expirings. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2023.44s)]
*  They got kiss bird on decent contract and they have a young nucleus of [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2027.04s)]
*  all guys that kind of like SAR. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2031.64s)]
*  I thought it looked a little Serge Ibaki last year. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2035.0800000000002s)]
*  We both like Trey Johnson and Michael Jackson. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2037.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2039.24s)]
*  The worst case scenario will be a 25 minutes a game, 16 minutes, 16 points [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2039.72s)]
*  a game, 40% from three, Bob Carrington. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2045.84s)]
*  I think we both liked. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2049.04s)]
*  Kim Whitmore. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2050.64s)]
*  We both like Kula Bali. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2051.44s)]
*  I feel like there's something there. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2052.92s)]
*  I like Kula Bali and Bob probably more than any of the players that are, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2054.24s)]
*  that have played in games for them. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2058.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2059.92s)]
*  I do think they, they do have a little bit of a, a little bit of a [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2060.16s)]
*  team of talked about- [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2064.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2068.0400000000004s)]
*  Up he private and the number of total ones the ones that have played in [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2068.1600000000003s)]
*  games for them is like, I do think they, they do have an edge to him. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  Like there's something kind of fun about them being young and not giving a shit [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2077.5600000000004s)]
*  or not knowing any better where you just would watch a, a random Washington game [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  late in the season, you'd be like, these guys are actually feeling themselves a [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2084.96s)]
*  little bit. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2087.88s)]
*  Uh- [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2088.6400000000003s)]
*  They have all their first, they have a couple of good swaps and the big thing [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2089.0s)]
*  and cash in and that might be a good one. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2092.36s)]
*  So the draft pick situations good, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2095.7200000000003s)]
*  the salary cap for the first time [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2097.78s)]
*  when is Washington had a good salary cap situation? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2100.82s)]
*  I can't even think of it in the last 15 years. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2104.2400000000002s)]
*  When they got Gilbert arenas, was that 20 years ago? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2109.6600000000003s)]
*  And I think the guys that run the team [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2114.04s)]
*  know what they're doing. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2115.54s)]
*  I love the guys that run the team, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2117.1800000000003s)]
*  but I do think when you're trying to gauge [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2119.26s)]
*  rosters going forward, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2121.92s)]
*  SAR might actually not be good too. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2124.0s)]
*  Would you allow that? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2126.26s)]
*  Is there a chance that SAR is like, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2127.5400000000004s)]
*  oh, that didn't really work, okay? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2129.0600000000004s)]
*  And then what is Bub? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2130.98s)]
*  And then is Koolibaly like an energy guy [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2132.0200000000004s)]
*  or is he a guy that you're like, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2134.0600000000004s)]
*  is there one guy on this team, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2135.1800000000003s)]
*  like the guy who may be tasked with getting you buckets [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2137.6600000000003s)]
*  at the end of a game where it's tight. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2140.7200000000003s)]
*  Granted, CJ could be there, Middleton, whatever. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2142.3s)]
*  So who's that on Chicago then? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2144.5400000000004s)]
*  Well, I still think Kobe White and Vuch and Giddy. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2146.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's just for next year though. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2152.3s)]
*  Well, still, it was harder for me to go, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2155.7799999999997s)]
*  hey, 110 and expiring contracts, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2159.02s)]
*  good draft capital coming in, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2161.2s)]
*  but the most valuable player is a guy [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2163.7799999999997s)]
*  who just went six in the draft two weeks ago. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2165.46s)]
*  That was hard for me to choose that. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2167.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2169.38s)]
*  Over, I'm not telling you I love everybody on the Bulls [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2170.54s)]
*  either, we're in agreement, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2173.54s)]
*  but I think there has to be something to set it's like, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2175.4s)]
*  hey, there's a couple of guys that are actually like good [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2177.8s)]
*  and have played multiple years on that team. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2179.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2181.28s)]
*  Would you rather have Washington's roster [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2182.36s)]
*  or the Nets roster? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2184.64s)]
*  I had the Nets second on my list [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2187.6800000000003s)]
*  of situations I wouldn't wanna have. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2190.08s)]
*  And I know they have a bunch of fun picks. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2193.88s)]
*  They have, so they got Porter and Terrence Mann [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2198.64s)]
*  for 54 and 56 million combined next two years. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2202.16s)]
*  Claxton's are one tradable asset. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2207.24s)]
*  I don't really love a single young guy on this team. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2210.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't even know if you asked me who my favorite net is. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2215.72s)]
*  I don't know what my answer would be. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess Nick Claxton. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2222.44s)]
*  That seems like a weird favorite player. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2225.48s)]
*  What's, who's the, who would you have as the best Nets asset? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2228.16s)]
*  Who's the one you're driving at home about thinking like, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2231.46s)]
*  that's our guy. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2233.7400000000002s)]
*  He'll be on the side of Parkway someday. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2235.5s)]
*  Isn't it Cam Thomas' scoring? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2237.42s)]
*  I know, you can't believe I just complimented Cam Thomas. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2241.78s)]
*  No. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2244.34s)]
*  So they have all their firsts. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2245.26s)]
*  They have a top eight, 2027 Philly pick. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2246.62s)]
*  They have three. They have nine future picks. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2249.7s)]
*  They have a good, yeah. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2251.42s)]
*  Yeah, they have three, Nick's first, 27, 29 and 31. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2252.7s)]
*  And the only bad thing is they have a swap with Houston [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2256.1s)]
*  27 where they lose the first. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2259.22s)]
*  So they, and what are the things with about like just throwing a season away? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2262.02s)]
*  We just saw this happen in the lottery. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2267.22s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily guarantee anything because they changed these lottery odds. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2269.02s)]
*  You saw Utah and Washington throw seasons away and get the fifth and six picks. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2273.2999999999997s)]
*  So when you hear about Brooklyn, they don't want to be good next year. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2277.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like, I don't know if they realize that doesn't guarantee jack shit anymore. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2280.2999999999997s)]
*  Cool. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2285.74s)]
*  You'll get the fifth pick in the draft. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2286.1s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2287.7s)]
*  I, at some point I'd rather, I'd rather have some combination of maybe some, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2289.06s)]
*  some young building blocks and I'm going to be bad anyway, just because there's [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2294.34s)]
*  so many good teams in the league or as much cap spaces, but they're like in no [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2298.18s)]
*  man's land. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2303.58s)]
*  I just, I don't understand what they did with all the cap space where they [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2304.62s)]
*  basically turned all of their cap space into Porter and Terrence Mann. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2307.7799999999997s)]
*  This, I thought it was really stupid and lost cam Johnson somehow. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2311.2999999999997s)]
*  My guess is they canvassed it. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2315.06s)]
*  That was the best they could do the unprotected, but I don't understand how [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2317.02s)]
*  they didn't get two assets because they did two things that helped the other team. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2320.58s)]
*  So we're just saying the same thing over here again. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2324.5s)]
*  But the problem is they're coming off of using five first round draft picks. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2328.18s)]
*  And there are a lot of teams that were like, if you were to say, Hey, you get [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2332.14s)]
*  five swings at it in this range, like you would have never thought that you were [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2337.2999999999997s)]
*  going to come up with those five players. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2340.82s)]
*  And who knows what they're going to do? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2342.22s)]
*  There's plenty of stuff that's wrong with the draft, but Winnhorst was even [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2343.38s)]
*  saying for Winnhorst to share that other GMs were laughing during the night at [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2346.1s)]
*  what the nets were doing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2351.54s)]
*  So you combine all of this together. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2352.9s)]
*  It's like, okay, so you picked up a couple picks here, but your starting five [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2354.6600000000003s)]
*  is Yegor, it's Cam, if he's healthy, that's your back court. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2359.42s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2363.5s)]
*  Zyre who they will have at small forward, MPJ power forward and, and yeah, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2364.2200000000003s)]
*  Claxton's like, you know, 20 million, it's declining contract. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2369.22s)]
*  He's still young. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2372.06s)]
*  That was kind of a weird thing because it seemed like they didn't really want to [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2373.62s)]
*  pay him, but they didn't want to lose the asset for nothing. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2375.8599999999997s)]
*  And then it's just all of these other guys. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2377.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, why not trade Claxton at this point? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2380.46s)]
*  If you're, if you're down this far down the road, trade Claxton, the Lakers or [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2382.4199999999996s)]
*  whoever, try to pick up a couple more assets. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2385.8999999999996s)]
*  I just think using cap space and cam Johnson to end up with a lot of the [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2389.14s)]
*  and cam Johnson to end up with Porter and one pick was insane. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2396.06s)]
*  That was my second, uh, that was my number two roster situation. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2400.66s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2404.3399999999997s)]
*  So you had them third. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2404.9799999999996s)]
*  No, I like, I like Washington situation better than the nets. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2407.3799999999997s)]
*  So let me, if I'm doing this, yeah. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2411.02s)]
*  So I'm going to Toronto, Brooklyn, but this whole exercise is I was doing it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2415.06s)]
*  I was kind of like, well, this doesn't feel, feel fair to Toronto. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2421.4599999999996s)]
*  If I'm qualifying like, Hey, Chicago has a bunch of good, but I just don't [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2424.7s)]
*  like how expensive Toronto is for the next three years. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2428.58s)]
*  We have no rules. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2431.66s)]
*  It's just how you feel. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2432.7799999999997s)]
*  This is a, how do I feel in my gut with these rosters? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2434.5s)]
*  You think if the nets called in some hypothetical and called the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2437.54s)]
*  wizards and said, you can have everything we have, we'll swap situations, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2441.7s)]
*  totally swap situations. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2446.3399999999997s)]
*  Wizards are saying no, 10 out of 10 times. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2447.58s)]
*  Wizards hanging up. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2449.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2450.8599999999997s)]
*  We agree. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2451.74s)]
*  We agree. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2452.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2454.86s)]
*  So I had Toronto third. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2455.78s)]
*  I had one team ahead of Washington in the number four spot and it surprised me. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2458.0600000000004s)]
*  And, uh, and I'm sure it's going to lead to some victory. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2462.78s)]
*  I'll come in my way over the next 24 hours. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2465.7400000000002s)]
*  Can't wait for that. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2467.7000000000003s)]
*  Don't tell me you picked Miami. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2469.1400000000003s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2470.6200000000003s)]
*  No way. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2471.42s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2473.7000000000003s)]
*  I flirted with it, but I was like, I can't, I can't. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2475.38s)]
*  And by the way, I liked some of the things they did, but, uh, they have [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2477.6600000000003s)]
*  this hero extension coming that I I'm just on pins and needles waiting [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2482.06s)]
*  to see how bad that contract is. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2485.86s)]
*  I think, especially when you've seen these numbers drop anything over. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2487.7s)]
*  What year one hero number, what number do you immediately start going [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2492.2599999999998s)]
*  like this, like that 40? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2499.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2501.06s)]
*  I think North of 40, you're like, why do you have to do this? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2501.2999999999997s)]
*  39. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2504.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, what are the numbers? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2507.9s)]
*  Well, I'm just saying year one, year one of the hair extension. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2509.42s)]
*  So if it's in the 37 range, you're feeling half decent. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2512.46s)]
*  Let's say it's 37, 39, 41, 43, 45. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2516.5800000000004s)]
*  You're that's basically 200 million bucks. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2520.1400000000003s)]
*  Five years, 200. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2523.78s)]
*  He could do a four year, two Oh seven. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2525.1800000000003s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2529.5800000000004s)]
*  Just that's where you just go. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2531.2200000000003s)]
*  No, or we don't have to do that. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2533.86s)]
*  Like, thanks for the buckets, man. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2536.2200000000003s)]
*  I just really good score. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2539.26s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2540.94s)]
*  No, that immediately would be a top five worst contract. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2542.2200000000003s)]
*  And I like here. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2545.26s)]
*  And I think he's a very fun offensive player, but that's you can't BAMS 37 [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2545.98s)]
*  this year, 51, 55, 59 Wiggins is 28 and 30. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2550.94s)]
*  They just gave Mitchell. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2555.34s)]
*  I was okay with that 11 and 12 for the next two. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2556.6200000000003s)]
*  They have Roger as an expiring young players where Hock has Yaka [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2559.1000000000004s)]
*  Shunas, Jovich. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2564.42s)]
*  Uh, the alarming thing is their 27 first goes to Charlotte and that's just [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2566.34s)]
*  unprotected. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2571.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh, that makes me nervous. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2572.38s)]
*  And I think what really makes me nervous with this roster is I'm not sure. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2574.82s)]
*  If they pay hero, I'm not sure how you get to the late 2020s with a move. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2580.06s)]
*  And I know they pulled a rabbit out of the hat. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2586.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm always scared of the heat. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2589.1000000000004s)]
*  Some of the shit they've done, like convincing Portland, take us on white [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2591.34s)]
*  side, somehow ended up with Jimmy Butler, like getting LeBron and Bosch. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2594.66s)]
*  Like they've been able to do it over the years, but at some point, uh, the past [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2599.14s)]
*  is the past and the future is the future. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2603.5s)]
*  I don't know how you go up a level with this roster. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2605.38s)]
*  I don't know what the miracle move is. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2608.98s)]
*  As much as I like BAM, there's probably a conversation about him being 51, 55, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2611.9s)]
*  and 60 million. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2616.22s)]
*  Like, is he that guy? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2617.3799999999997s)]
*  And then you compare it like that's where the hero extension seems even nastier. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2619.58s)]
*  Cause I probably like hero more now than I ever have because I think the shot [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2623.8599999999997s)]
*  making is that special, but it's pretty one dimensional and you know, there's, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2628.3799999999997s)]
*  if there's not somebody else to hide him defensively, it's a disaster as we've [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2634.22s)]
*  seen in the last two playoff rounds. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2637.9s)]
*  I mean, they got smoked. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2639.94s)]
*  He was hunted, I think as voraciously as any player in the league. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2642.22s)]
*  Any player in the East. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2646.38s)]
*  And they did it with the Celtics in that matchup last year. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2648.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, they had, cause they had to put the better defender on Tatum ended up with [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2651.82s)]
*  Jaylen Brown being guarded by hero. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2655.82s)]
*  You're like, Oh my God, this is, and you still had like some zombie heat stuff. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2657.7000000000003s)]
*  So if you're going 50, that's just a lot, like 101, 105 million with BAM and [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2661.82s)]
*  hero is your, is your top two guys. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2667.86s)]
*  And that kind of gets back to like, Hey, we're not a friend, you know, depending [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2669.78s)]
*  on whatever team you are, we're not afraid to spend, but it's like, how are [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2673.42s)]
*  you spending on your top three guys? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2675.98s)]
*  That's, that's way too much for those two guys. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2678.7400000000002s)]
*  And I, and I actually like both players, but it's a problem when I, I like BAM [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2680.94s)]
*  and hero too, but when you just levitate above it and you go, all right, where's [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2685.9s)]
*  my ceiling with BAM and hero are my two best, most expensive players. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2689.58s)]
*  What am I winning? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2693.5s)]
*  And the answer is nothing. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2694.3s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2696.14s)]
*  LeBron is in this situation right now in the Lakers. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2696.86s)]
*  LeBron, like the, we talked about last week about those rich Paul LeBron wants [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2700.02s)]
*  to compete for titles. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2704.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2706.5s)]
*  Well, you have a team that has Luca Donchich on it. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2707.02s)]
*  Who's probably the best young offensive superstar that has come into the [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2709.58s)]
*  league that's a non-center in a long time. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2715.82s)]
*  And he was one of the best seven guys in the league. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2718.58s)]
*  You have role players, you have a good coach. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2720.98s)]
*  You were a three seed last year. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2724.7799999999997s)]
*  You're not a title contender. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2727.86s)]
*  Could part of that be that you're paying LeBron $53 million and he's 41? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2729.5s)]
*  And you have to get nine months out of them. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2734.06s)]
*  I think that's a piece of it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2735.42s)]
*  You know, so at some point, like, can you win a title if Luca LeBron and Reeves [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2737.18s)]
*  are your three best players and most of your salary cap and LeBron seems to [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2742.5s)]
*  think maybe not, but he's part of part of the issue because of what they're paying [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2746.86s)]
*  them and it's same thing with Miami. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2753.42s)]
*  Like if you have BAM and here, I just don't know what the, what the ceiling is. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2755.2999999999997s)]
*  Round two. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2760.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2761.02s)]
*  I mean, that's why they were looking at Durant, although I guess they [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2761.54s)]
*  backed off on it this summer. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2764.3s)]
*  Then that Wiggins deal that was being floated around for Rui and then all [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2767.98s)]
*  these other Lakers pieces. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2771.94s)]
*  I'm like, I'd rather have Rui than Wiggins. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2773.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2776.46s)]
*  I didn't understand. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2776.7s)]
*  What was that? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2777.34s)]
*  Like Rui and Vincent and some other stuff. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2777.74s)]
*  So anyway, I have a connect that poor kid just hasn't been able to [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2780.14s)]
*  unpack his bags for months. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2783.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2786.62s)]
*  He's a, he's in a motel. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2786.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2789.26s)]
*  He's a, he's in a motel eight. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2789.5s)]
*  So I have Miami fourth. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2791.1800000000003s)]
*  Who else did you have in your top four? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2792.2200000000003s)]
*  Did you put Charlotte in there? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2794.6200000000003s)]
*  I put Charlotte in there. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2795.6200000000003s)]
*  You know, they won 19 games last year, third lowest in the league. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2798.6600000000003s)]
*  They have a million players on the books, by the way, too. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2804.26s)]
*  It is a shocking spot track. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2807.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2810.1800000000003s)]
*  It's you need, you need a break. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2810.6600000000003s)]
*  I forgot they have Josh Green. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2812.26s)]
*  Oh, there's Grant Williams. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2813.6600000000003s)]
*  And so if you look at Lamello, he's 38, 41, 43 and a half, 46 and a half. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2815.9s)]
*  He's played 105 games the last three years. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2821.2200000000003s)]
*  And then with Mellow Bridges, Sexton's expiring Josh Green, Grant Williams, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2824.58s)]
*  Miller, they're all the next two years, except for Sexton. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2829.3s)]
*  And again, Miller's not an extension yet. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2833.38s)]
*  So you could talk me into, Hey, Miller's nice. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2835.14s)]
*  You know, they, they, maybe they killed it in the drive of canipple and getting [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2839.46s)]
*  back in at the end of the first round. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2843.74s)]
*  But this Charlotte is in my top four as I would rather have Miami. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2845.7799999999997s)]
*  Cause at least if I'm paying Bam and Hero, I'm paying, I'm paying guys that [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2851.5s)]
*  I know are top tier, but I like, I don't think I have to worry about them. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2856.58s)]
*  Where I think Mellow is, unless it changes, and this isn't exactly new, but [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2861.1s)]
*  I think the franchise is somewhat held hostage to somebody who was really [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2868.42s)]
*  dynamic and fun and a fan favorite. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2872.78s)]
*  And it's like, all right, we kind of have something here. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2876.38s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, but you may have something that's like a worthwhile [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2878.7000000000003s)]
*  attraction that is also getting in the way of who you can be as a basketball team. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2881.06s)]
*  And if I were running a team that, that had to deal with that, like that's the [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2886.9s)]
*  stuff where I just think it's like, we're not making basketball decisions here. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2890.58s)]
*  We're making like entertainment decisions. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2893.46s)]
*  But if Charlotte called Miami and said, well, Chadi, the Mellow for Hero, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2896.58s)]
*  I think Miami's cool, would call it in. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2900.58s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2904.22s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't, he misses a ton of games. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2905.06s)]
*  So even if you love them. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2907.18s)]
*  So, I mean, if, if you were Charlotte and they called Pat Riley and said, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2909.06s)]
*  do you want our situation? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2912.94s)]
*  I was going to ask you that if Charlotte calls Pat Riley and said, we'll flip [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2915.46s)]
*  everything, every player we have and all of the draft picks we have for your [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2918.98s)]
*  entire situation, I think Miami says yes. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2923.18s)]
*  You do. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2927.54s)]
*  I do. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2928.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it's a better situation. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2929.3s)]
*  I get Lamello, I get Brandon Miller, I get Canipal. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2931.3s)]
*  I get Bridges on a decent deal. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2934.34s)]
*  Maybe that's the greatest guy. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2936.3s)]
*  Sexton, I get all these picks. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2938.46s)]
*  I get a Dallas first. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2940.3s)]
*  I have some calf space. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2941.58s)]
*  I think I'd rather have that situation. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2944.06s)]
*  I think I talked about this on the pod with you already, but I really like all [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2945.94s)]
*  the stuff Charlotte did where they're basically like the, just these little [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2949.9s)]
*  slight upgrade deals, you know, like, all right, we'll take, we'll help you out [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2953.42s)]
*  with Conaton and you can take Michich and buy them out and, um, and we'll take [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2957.74s)]
*  some stuff with that, but you know, nothing, nothing major, but just kind of smart. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2962.1s)]
*  Just seems like the boat's rowing in the right direction finally for them. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2967.02s)]
*  Took a while, but it only took the entire decade. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2970.3799999999997s)]
*  Uh, all right. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2973.54s)]
*  Teams. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2974.1s)]
*  I think it's smarter, much smarter group and everybody would tell you the front [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2976.4599999999996s)]
*  office owners and Charles Lee. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2979.4599999999996s)]
*  So it was going to take a little while for you to feel it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2981.54s)]
*  And, you know, I think the Lamelo decision is a big one. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2984.66s)]
*  Uh, we'll see, maybe he's just healthy and plays well and there's more talent [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2989.82s)]
*  around him and it all kind of works out. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2993.34s)]
*  Cause that'd be cool too. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2994.78s)]
*  Cause there's a lot of people that love them down there, but [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2995.58s)]
*  two honorable mentions for me. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2998.42s)]
*  We're we're Milwaukee and Indiana and I, I'm not willing to panic about Indiana. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2999.94s)]
*  Um, I just think it's going to be one bad year for them, but they do [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3004.9s)]
*  have their first round pick. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3008.5s)]
*  They do have a bunch of guys on good contracts. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3010.06s)]
*  They have a great coach winning pedigree. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3012.26s)]
*  Halburn should be back in a year and whatever. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3014.5800000000004s)]
*  Um, so Milwaukee just quickly, cause I think that didn't make the top five for [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  me and, uh, I'm already on the record is just how stupefied I was by the [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3022.6600000000003s)]
*  damn thing and everything they did. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3028.2200000000003s)]
*  And, uh, it's interesting that the bucks fans for the most part seem like. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3030.26s)]
*  They're fully supportive of what they did with the honest. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3036.1400000000003s)]
*  And I was trying, I was really trying to look at it from the other side. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3039.54s)]
*  Cause my, my instincts on it were so against it. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3042.18s)]
*  And I thought it was just so crazy because if you're going to do everything [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3046.98s)]
*  they did, but not locked down, oh, they did all this stuff. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3050.34s)]
*  They now have no outs whatsoever. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3055.9s)]
*  But now they're the second best team in the East. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3058.38s)]
*  Like you could get it. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3060.38s)]
*  They still have, I think the eighth best odds on Fandel with the East. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3061.42s)]
*  Eighth in the East, eighth in the East. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3065.34s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3067.7799999999997s)]
*  They're 20 to one in the East. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3068.98s)]
*  So if you, so if you're going to do counters, I guess it looks like this. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3070.46s)]
*  Yannis doesn't want to go and they don't want to lose Yannis. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3078.42s)]
*  So they have a two year window with him and then he's got the player option. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3081.26s)]
*  So they're basically looking at it like these next two years, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3084.54s)]
*  like this name thing fucked us. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3087.5s)]
*  We have to figure this out. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3090.7400000000002s)]
*  We don't want to trade Yannis. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3092.1800000000003s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3093.7000000000003s)]
*  So they save 14 million and 13 million for those first two years [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3095.46s)]
*  with the Dame Turner thing. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3098.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3100.26s)]
*  So you can be like, okay, that's good. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3101.3s)]
*  That's positive. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3102.6200000000003s)]
*  We save money, even though we're paying out of our ass in the back way. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3103.34s)]
*  Turnaround paper is a good center for Yannis, right? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3107.9s)]
*  Can shoot threes, shot, their defense is going to be good. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3110.6600000000003s)]
*  They really hurt the Pacers, which I think they hate the Pacers. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3115.38s)]
*  So I'm sure that was like a fun thing for them. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3118.94s)]
*  One thing I was thinking, and maybe I should have thought about this a few [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3121.86s)]
*  days ago, but I think we both think Turner would have been a, maybe a third. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3125.54s)]
*  If you're talking about overpaying Turner, maybe it's 130 for four years. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3129.2200000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't have blinked if that was the number, right? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3134.02s)]
*  I would have been like, Whoa, that's high. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3136.06s)]
*  But I kind of thought it was going to be around there. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3137.26s)]
*  So they get him like 5 million a year cheaper. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3140.3s)]
*  Um, the East is wide open. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3144.2200000000003s)]
*  And you mentioned this on the pod with Bobby that with the cap jumping [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3145.82s)]
*  7 to 10% every year, maybe there is a little bit more of an NFL mentality [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3150.02s)]
*  where it's like, all right, we're going to lose 22 million a year, but the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3154.6600000000003s)]
*  cap's going to go up like by the time we get to year five, maybe that's not [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3157.86s)]
*  that dangerous anyway, but the big thing is he did nothing. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3161.1s)]
*  You throw away Yannis here. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3163.7000000000003s)]
*  So I really tried to see it from their side. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3165.86s)]
*  I never would have done this. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3168.94s)]
*  And I just, I just want to make that clear again, but I understand like [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3170.42s)]
*  they're just, they're so far all in that at this point, it's like, Whoa, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3175.58s)]
*  everyone's getting fired anyway. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3179.54s)]
*  If this doesn't work out, we might as well try this. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3180.98s)]
*  I still wouldn't have done it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3183.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3186.34s)]
*  My first thing on it was like, just knowing the Pacers, cause we had even [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3187.18s)]
*  mentioned this, I think just in passing, we didn't really dig into it, but I [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3191.66s)]
*  was like, I wonder if the Halliburton injury will be an excuse for that Pacers [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3194.86s)]
*  ownership group to then not pay the tax again, even though they had flipped [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3197.74s)]
*  the 25 pick for the 26, you looked at it, but like, Hey, that's a pretty smart [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3201.74s)]
*  kind of heady deal and it maybe means like they're going to go into the tax a [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3205.14s)]
*  little bit, but I don't know how the revenue split breaks down. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3208.7s)]
*  Cause like even going into the tax a little bit, then when you officially [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3212.54s)]
*  become a tax paying team, I know back in the day, it was like, you're sacrificing [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3214.8199999999997s)]
*  millions, but you would have thought, Hey, they can't do this, right? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3217.8199999999997s)]
*  They can't just a week and a half after being eliminated in game seven of the [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3222.2999999999997s)]
*  finals, they can't just let Turner go. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3224.8199999999997s)]
*  And then the more I thought about it, the more I, I actually was like, the [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3227.3399999999997s)]
*  only thing that impressed me about it was that Turner and his reps were able [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3232.1s)]
*  to pull this off, but they were able to find cap space for him that didn't exist [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3235.42s)]
*  through the stretch revision because I, it reminds me a bit of like, I remember [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3241.7000000000003s)]
*  when the vooch trade was done to Chicago and a front office guy who's really good. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3246.9s)]
*  We were talking about the trade and he said, you know, I just have, I think [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3253.26s)]
*  a good rule is if you're giving up those kinds of assets and they're giving up [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3257.62s)]
*  two first, right? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3261.86s)]
*  And they're giving up Wendell and yeah, that was, that was a lot to give up for [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3262.7000000000003s)]
*  vooch. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3266.1400000000003s)]
*  Wendell went two first. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3266.5s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3267.5800000000004s)]
*  So you're like, if you're going to do that kind of deal, you have to be able to say [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3269.1400000000003s)]
*  like, okay, we go from a first round exit to like a second round exit, or maybe, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3275.42s)]
*  you know, we, we have the third best chance of being in the Eastern conference [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3279.98s)]
*  finals, right? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3283.2200000000003s)]
*  We're not one, we're not two, but like, could we sit here and be realistic about [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3284.02s)]
*  it and say, Hey, we'll, we'll be in the top three of the East with this [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3289.34s)]
*  investment. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3294.5s)]
*  And it's like, when you look at the vooch deal, you go, yeah, we're probably the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3295.78s)]
*  same team. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3300.1000000000004s)]
*  We're probably the same team ceiling wise of what we can be in the East in the [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3301.34s)]
*  playoffs, despite, you know, vooch who puts up some numbers in theory, stretches [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3305.34s)]
*  of floor and all that kind of stuff. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3309.54s)]
*  This deal felt like it reminded me of that where it's like, okay, what were we [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3311.02s)]
*  before and now what do we guarantee ourselves? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3314.94s)]
*  Like how much is the ceiling actually improved? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3318.3s)]
*  Even though Turner's better than Brooke Lopez at this stage of their careers. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3320.9s)]
*  There's an argument. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3324.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3326.38s)]
*  There's an argument to be made. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3326.6200000000003s)]
*  It's like, you may not have guaranteed yourself advancing at all in the East. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3327.5800000000004s)]
*  And that's, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3333.1800000000003s)]
*  it's tough. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3336.98s)]
*  Fun. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3337.42s)]
*  I don't, I think the Dame thing combined with the situation in the room with [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3338.6600000000003s)]
*  the honest, they didn't have the luxury of what the Celtics did, but I just, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3343.66s)]
*  when you look at their picks, which is the other piece of that, where they [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3349.46s)]
*  basically don't control any of their picks the next five years, they kind of [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3352.2599999999998s)]
*  don't have a choice at that point. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3355.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3356.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3357.06s)]
*  We're just like, well, what are we going to do? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3357.58s)]
*  So hopefully miles Turner's awesome for us. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3359.06s)]
*  Hopefully we can patch together. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3361.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, if they got your guy's CP for a year, not inconceivable. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3362.9s)]
*  Um, let's see. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3371.1s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3372.86s)]
*  We're gonna take a break and then we're gonna do the West. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3373.7400000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3375.66s)]
*  The West, the number one is a little easier in the West. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3375.86s)]
*  I would assume we have the same number one, a team owned by, uh, the one, the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3380.06s)]
*  only Matt Ishby, Matt was one T. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3384.34s)]
*  I am going to ask you if this is the bleakest situation since the mid 2010s [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3388.58s)]
*  Brooklyn nets after pro crowds, like let's do one 80 and then we don't have any [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3395.1s)]
*  picks, but I don't want to spend money anymore. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3399.42s)]
*  Uh, is this the worst situation since then? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3401.7s)]
*  Uh, I don't think it's that bad. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3406.66s)]
*  Is it still a Booker? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3411.46s)]
*  All of their picks are gone or swapped until 2031 and that picks gone too. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3416.38s)]
*  I think that goes to Utah. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3421.82s)]
*  They have Booker lockdown. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3425.86s)]
*  They're going to buy Beale out apparently in the next 24 hours for some crazy price. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3427.3799999999997s)]
*  Jalen green three for one Oh five. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3434.06s)]
*  I don't think either of us would want to pay that Brooks for two years, Grayson [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3435.74s)]
*  Allen and Rose O'Neill double figures for the next couple of years. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3441.58s)]
*  They have the two Charlotte centers and they're going to be paying Booker [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3445.2999999999997s)]
*  like $75 million a year on a new extension. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3450.1s)]
*  And then probably what nine months from now is good. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3454.66s)]
*  Like, Hey guys, I can use some, you know, winning team now. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3457.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3460.18s)]
*  It seems to be, he seems to be like to totally into the Phoenix thing. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3460.58s)]
*  So I, I don't know. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3464.7s)]
*  I can't predict how he's going to feel other than he's felt like a really good [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3466.34s)]
*  partner as the face of the franchise, as opposed to some other guys, uh, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3470.7s)]
*  they're going to be a lottery team without a pick and I don't see any path [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3475.46s)]
*  forward. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3480.38s)]
*  I don't, I mean, Maliage, Maliage would have to be a, like a revelation for me [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3480.86s)]
*  to feel better about this situation. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3488.2200000000003s)]
*  Like a revelation where we're like, Holy shit, this is like watching Ewing in [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3490.9s)]
*  Georgetown. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3494.34s)]
*  This is QF the 85 viewing highlights. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3496.38s)]
*  He's back. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3499.34s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a little surprising, although you know, I did, I did like him. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3503.98s)]
*  I liked him too. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3509.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3511.1s)]
*  This is just one of those it's back to the no outs things. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3511.54s)]
*  Like Booker's still better. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3514.18s)]
*  Booker's better than anyone on Utah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3515.66s)]
*  Booker's better than anybody on Portland. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3517.5s)]
*  Booker's better than anybody on New Orleans. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3520.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3522.94s)]
*  San Antonio, you know, that's probably not a conversation just because of what [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3523.66s)]
*  we think of Wembe, but it's, uh, the only argument you have here is, is Booker's [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3527.34s)]
*  talent level then surrounded by no options and it's expensive. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3534.22s)]
*  Who do you have number two? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3539.5s)]
*  Sacramento. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3544.98s)]
*  I had them as well. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3546.22s)]
*  I don't know that you realize how bad it is until you go through the exercise. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3548.74s)]
*  I was stunned. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3552.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3553.7s)]
*  So it's Levine and Sabonis are a cool 90 million. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3554.1s)]
*  Um, and then 94 in a year from now. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3560.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3564.34s)]
*  Like Miami fans should be going, well, at least we're not doing that with BAM hero. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3564.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3568.9s)]
*  So you've got Sabonis, Levine, DeRozan who, you know, look, DeRozan at 25 and [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3569.66s)]
*  28 million is fine. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3576.8999999999996s)]
*  Like a guy just seems to age really well. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3578.46s)]
*  Monks at like 40 million in the next two years, but it's 133 and a half million [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3580.18s)]
*  for those four guys this year. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3584.8999999999996s)]
*  It's 142 and a half million next year for those four guys. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3586.1s)]
*  Um, then here's Dennis Schroeder for three for 44. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3589.3399999999997s)]
*  Let's throw him in there. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3593.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3595.18s)]
*  I went at the time though. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3595.46s)]
*  I would have rather done that deal than the Laverte deal. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3596.66s)]
*  Cause I just think Schroeder can find ways to help in multiple ways, but it's [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3599.3399999999997s)]
*  just not a very exciting team. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3603.8999999999996s)]
*  You have, I think the least winning top paid player on a team, a guy that, I mean, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3605.66s)]
*  none of this is again, new on my Levine stuff, but that's, um, that's a team that [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3612.8999999999996s)]
*  is fucked. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3617.74s)]
*  Well, and Keegan Murray, who they're going to have to make a decision on an [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3619.8199999999997s)]
*  extension at some point. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3623.8999999999996s)]
*  And I just feels like he's gotten worse the last two years where they felt like [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3625.2599999999998s)]
*  there was something there. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3629.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm not seeing it. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3630.74s)]
*  They have, they have their own first. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3631.54s)]
*  They have a mini 2031 and they have a top eight San Antonio first. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3633.74s)]
*  So they have stuff to trade. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3637.74s)]
*  I, there was Zach floated this out a couple of times that this seemed like a [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3640.4199999999996s)]
*  possible Jaylen Brown overpay team. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3644.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, I still feel like if you're going to make the, if we're going to do an [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3647.2999999999997s)]
*  overpay who's most likely to just do a complete crazy overpay trade fantasy [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3651.02s)]
*  draft, I think I would have them first. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3655.54s)]
*  Cause they're, they're like Chicago and no man's land, but they don't want to [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3658.58s)]
*  be a no man's land and they're ready to do stuff. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3662.38s)]
*  I just don't think the opportunity has presented itself, but, uh, it's a weird [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3664.7s)]
*  one. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3670.62s)]
*  I just don't like the roster. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3670.78s)]
*  I don't like the guys together and they don't really have a lot of outs with it. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3672.06s)]
*  You know, the DeRozan contract last year made sense when they did it, but now [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3676.14s)]
*  you know, is if you call it Atlanta and said, Hey, you want to take the Rosen [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3681.02s)]
*  in your trade exception? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3684.3s)]
*  I just don't think Atlanta would do it. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3685.34s)]
*  So, uh, yeah, I had them second as well. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3688.06s)]
*  I'm sure they can move to Rosen if they want to, cause I still think the Rosen, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3691.14s)]
*  like I cannot believe how productive he still is. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3695.02s)]
*  But it's, you do it for norm Powell. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3697.82s)]
*  Um, you know, I think norm, I probably, I'd probably rather pay norm cause he's [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3700.62s)]
*  younger and I would give, uh, I would say his injury stuff last year is what the [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3706.34s)]
*  railed, what was like an insane start for him. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3710.78s)]
*  So, uh, and norm's a better shooter from three. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3714.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3718.38s)]
*  I'd rather have norm too. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3718.94s)]
*  Who'd you have for your third team? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3719.9s)]
*  This, I thought number three was tough. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3722.5400000000004s)]
*  It was pretty clear that Phoenix was one and Sacramento was two. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3724.5s)]
*  And then third, I thought, uh, I thought it was a hard one. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3728.78s)]
*  See the way you're going with this, I feel like you're going to say pelicans now. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3734.7400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3740.18s)]
*  You know me, you know me so well. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3740.5s)]
*  That's who I had. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3743.3399999999997s)]
*  All right. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3744.3399999999997s)]
*  So give me the Pelicans argument. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3744.62s)]
*  It's a team of assets that I like that make no sense together. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3748.1s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be good next year and they don't have their pick. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3754.4199999999996s)]
*  And I think my favorite asset of everybody they have is Troy Murphy at four for one [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3759.2999999999997s)]
*  12, Herb Jones, two for 29. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3765.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, I said Troy Murphy, Trey Murphy. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3769.4199999999996s)]
*  Sorry, Trey, Trey Murphy. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3774.74s)]
*  Remember Troy Murphy? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3777.14s)]
*  My dad always liked him. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3778.3399999999997s)]
*  My dad always enjoyed Troy Murphy. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3780.8599999999997s)]
*  Trey Murphy, four for one 12 Jones, two for 29. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3782.5s)]
*  They've queen and fears and Hawkins and Missy, you know, some good young talent. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3786.1s)]
*  Murray coming back up in Achilles. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3791.5s)]
*  They have Jordan pool for two years for reasons that remain unclear. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3793.18s)]
*  And then this weird Zion situation. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3796.98s)]
*  And it's like they're zigging and zagging at the same time by trading your pick. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3799.58s)]
*  You're telling us you think you can compete for a top six playoff spot. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3804.8999999999996s)]
*  And yet looking at the raw at the West, I don't see any chance that happens. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3808.8199999999997s)]
*  I like a bunch of the guys. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3815.46s)]
*  So. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3816.98s)]
*  Me too. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3818.5s)]
*  Saying this is third worst. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3818.8999999999996s)]
*  It's more a reflection of the West than, than them. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3821.58s)]
*  Cause I don't think they would be top five worse than the East. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3824.8599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3828.2999999999997s)]
*  But like, let's just play it out. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3828.5s)]
*  Why is this worse than Utah? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3829.62s)]
*  Um, cause all those picks Utah has combined with, uh, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3833.34s)]
*  they have two first out of their own Minnesota and Cleveland and 27, 29. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3844.14s)]
*  They've got a Lakers top four protected 27. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3848.22s)]
*  They've got the unprotected Phoenix 31. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3851.26s)]
*  They've got a swap with Minnesota or Cleveland and 28. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3853.74s)]
*  Another swap or excuse me, in 26 and then another Cleveland swap in 28. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3857.58s)]
*  But it's weird. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3863.58s)]
*  I guess I'm factoring in like Utah knows what they're doing more. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3864.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe that shouldn't factor into this. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3867.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3869.7799999999997s)]
*  But if we're going like through the Utah players. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3870.02s)]
*  So you'd rather have the new Orleans players in the Utah picks. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3873.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3878.7s)]
*  Who's the best asset? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3882.7799999999997s)]
*  Give me the, give me the three best assets on Utah. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3883.8999999999996s)]
*  Marking. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3887.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3888.5s)]
*  Probably ace Bailey just cause of where they picked them. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3891.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3894.8999999999996s)]
*  Go back to the Washington thing. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3895.2999999999997s)]
*  Kessler. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3896.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3899.02s)]
*  It gets bleak fast. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3899.3399999999997s)]
*  Hendricks Clayton Jr. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3900.74s)]
*  Well, New Orleans has two cap killer assets in, in Murray coming off of his [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3903.18s)]
*  injury and then Jordan poll who they willingly traded for, for 66 million [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3910.1s)]
*  for two years, they were like, sure. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3915.98s)]
*  Um, I, uh, and they have a bunch of young players. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3918.58s)]
*  I actually think the way they built their roster is going to be [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3923.62s)]
*  counterproductive cause it's too many guys and none of them have really proven [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3926.66s)]
*  anything. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3929.94s)]
*  So you have all these different assets. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3931.54s)]
*  Like Trey Murphy is going to be like, I'm ready to have an awesome year [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3933.26s)]
*  and be discussed in a real way. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3936.58s)]
*  Herb Jones is like, I'm ready to do all her Jones things on a good team. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3938.78s)]
*  Zion has been in the league now six years. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3943.26s)]
*  What's when is the Zion? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3946.86s)]
*  Hey guys, I'm laying the smack down. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3948.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know what to make of this team. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3950.78s)]
*  Um, Zion is in this, in his career, it's just always worth reminding everybody [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3952.86s)]
*  this 24 games, 61 games, zero games, 29 games, 70 games where you got hurt in [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3957.78s)]
*  the plan against the Lakers when he had 40 and then 30 games last year. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3964.54s)]
*  So it's, it's a lot like the Lamello thing where you have this thing and [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3969.1s)]
*  you're like, okay, but you're just waiting around for him. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3975.22s)]
*  I mean, if he's healthy somewhere, honestly, if he's healthy somewhere else [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3979.1s)]
*  and puts up some big numbers, then so be it. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3981.66s)]
*  You got to move on from this. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3985.06s)]
*  There is a New Orleans stink that is it's hard to separate it from the [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3985.66s)]
*  situation because being in New Orleans with how dysfunctional that organization [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3988.8999999999996s)]
*  and city and ownership has been year after year after year, if you just [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3993.66s)]
*  basically took all this stuff and put it with a better infrastructure and [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3997.14s)]
*  everything around it, you might be in better shape, but you know, it's just [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4002.82s)]
*  year after year in that city with the, with the, you know, I don't know. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4008.3s)]
*  I mean, you read that piece this week about, he called Atlanta, kept asking [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4014.98s)]
*  them over and over again. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4021.9s)]
*  So it's an unprotected pick, right? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4024.06s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, yeah, it's I'm protected. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4026.3s)]
*  It's like, just one more time. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4027.6200000000003s)]
*  It's unprotected, right? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4029.26s)]
*  Like you hear stuff like that. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4030.82s)]
*  And like, holy shit. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4032.3s)]
*  How does, how does this team even suit up 82 times? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4034.0600000000004s)]
*  How do they even coordinate the travel correctly? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4036.94s)]
*  And these are the new guys, cities. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4039.86s)]
*  These are the new guys. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4042.0600000000004s)]
*  So it's basically weavers running the team for Dumars and weaver. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4043.26s)]
*  Like, I don't think could have done a worse job for the pistons. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4047.1800000000003s)]
*  Could he have done a worse job? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4051.26s)]
*  I'm not, that was one of those, like, I'm not positive that guy was [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4054.0600000000004s)]
*  going to get another job. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4056.7400000000002s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4059.1400000000003s)]
*  So who'd you have third if it was New Orleans, you had Utah. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4059.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4064.1800000000003s)]
*  Cause I like Trey Herb and the potential of Zion. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4064.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4069.98s)]
*  It's a three, three B. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4070.7400000000002s)]
*  There's, that would be an interesting one. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4072.3s)]
*  I think Utah would probably say we're fine. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4075.1000000000004s)]
*  We have all of these picks. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4078.38s)]
*  We, you know, if Taylor Hendricks turns out to be something Clayton or [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4080.38s)]
*  Keontae turn into something maybe, I mean, you know, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4086.2999999999997s)]
*  it's a good argument. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4090.46s)]
*  It's I think those are the three and four in some order. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4091.4199999999996s)]
*  And then I couldn't believe I had this team in the top five, but I kind of ran [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4094.46s)]
*  out of teams because the West is, but I think it's the Clippers. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4099.7s)]
*  I think they have to be fifth, even though I think that's a, I think there are [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4105.7s)]
*  potential round three playoff team this year, but I just like big [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4112.26s)]
*  picture Kawhi for two more years, 50 and 50. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4115.98s)]
*  They're paying quiet hearted 90 and 92. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4120.58s)]
*  They pound Bogdanovic on expirings. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4124.139999999999s)]
*  That's about it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4126.0599999999995s)]
*  Not a lot of leverage with the roster. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4126.66s)]
*  Um, they have some, some couple of positive pick stuff and a couple lousy [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4129.179999999999s)]
*  pick stuff, including, um, a Philly swap. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4135.9s)]
*  They're 28 goes to Philly and stuff like that. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4139.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, they do have 26 million on the cap in 27, 28. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4141.740000000001s)]
*  I listen in the East, it's, they would, wouldn't even sniff the top five, but I [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4146.3s)]
*  was just trying to think of like, what situation could potentially just go [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4149.700000000001s)]
*  badly and you have to go with them or Golden State because Golden State is [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4153.02s)]
*  basically this two year runway. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4157.66s)]
*  Now they're on the cap in the summer of 27, they'll have $23 million [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4159.38s)]
*  employers in the cap, so they're open for business in all of these ways. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4164.62s)]
*  But that could also go horribly, you know, and maybe short-term at my time. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4168.74s)]
*  So it's one of those two, I think in that spot, cause I can't put Portland. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4173.66s)]
*  I like the Portland five year situation over both of those teams. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4177.94s)]
*  Yeah, I went through and did Portland stuff. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4183.179999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, Grant's done all the books for 32, 34 million in the next two years. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4185.3s)]
*  And you forget he's on the team, but I think between like, if you look at [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4189.5s)]
*  Drew, he didn't like the Drew contract either. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4194.26s)]
*  Drew three for a hundred basically. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4196.34s)]
*  And then the grain, I was honestly, I was shocked that they did that. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4198.3s)]
*  But, uh, if you were right, it's starting to look worse now that we've [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4201.54s)]
*  seen some of the free agent money that Drew's going to make that with some of [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4206.42s)]
*  the other prices that guy's got, maybe that I might've been wrong in that one. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4211.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but you kind of were right because they got an asset out of it where I [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4217.26s)]
*  thought that's clearly a pick in a dump. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4221.18s)]
*  I would've thought they were going to have to attach a pick to it. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4224.74s)]
*  And then the Celtics are just super confident. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4226.78s)]
*  Like they did a really good job of canvassing the market. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4228.54s)]
*  You heard they, they've got a landing spot for this guy, but if they don't [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4230.74s)]
*  need to do it that way, they could do this thing first. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4234.34s)]
*  And then, you know, they, they got out of a ton of money and save [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4236.18s)]
*  themselves a ton of money and they still have the flexibility back. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4239.62s)]
*  Like I think Neang's a rotation guy and a good team. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4242.42s)]
*  Um, I think Simon's allows you to get creative or you could just say, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4245.46s)]
*  why don't you score some points? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4250.46s)]
*  I don't know what they're going to do with them, but you could, you could see [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4251.34s)]
*  them having like an okay season where he's scoring a ton off the bench. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4253.7s)]
*  And they're just like, look, you're a scorer and you can find much a shot. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4257.179999999999s)]
*  So look, I think if you go through Portland stuff, you go, okay. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4259.82s)]
*  The picks are where it gets really good. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4264.26s)]
*  Sharp feels like a nice, like maybe Denny's looked like he's going to be good. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4266.3s)]
*  I think Scoot took a step in the right direction, still needs to be better [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4271.9s)]
*  for him to match kind of our excitement. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4275.58s)]
*  Kamara, I love Klingon. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4277.86s)]
*  You know, I don't, I don't know if Chris Murray's getting the world excited [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4280.54s)]
*  about it, but there's at least like among the five new guys that are in there. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4283.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4287.3s)]
*  There's kind of some hope where even with some of these other teams that are bad, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4287.740000000001s)]
*  you can't, you've probably given up on three of three of the six or seven young [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4291.9800000000005s)]
*  guys already, uh, if that makes any sense. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4297.1s)]
*  They have Milwaukee swaps in 20 and 30. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4301.22s)]
*  They can keep the best version of Boston or Milwaukee in 29. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4304.5s)]
*  They have all their own picks. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4308.38s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4310.740000000001s)]
*  And, and I think they're going to be a really interesting, wouldn't be shocked [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4311.34s)]
*  if they went like 47 and 35 type of team this year, just cause I think their [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4317.18s)]
*  defense is going to be really good. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4321.26s)]
*  And it's going to hinge on our guy. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4324.38s)]
*  We have a ton of Scoot stock. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4328.38s)]
*  Um, it's going to hinge on how good offensively he can be for them. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4329.74s)]
*  But, uh, I kind of like the team. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4333.9800000000005s)]
*  I think they have an identity. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4336.66s)]
*  I think that's a really hard thing to do when you're a lottery team, to build a [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4337.82s)]
*  type of group of players that seem like they actually fit together, which I [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4341.14s)]
*  don't think New Orleans has. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4344.860000000001s)]
*  Um, it'll be interesting though, cause there was one number that showed kind of [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4348.1s)]
*  an outlier opposing three point percentage in the second half and that may [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4354.26s)]
*  every now and then you'll see some weird outlier opposing three point percentage [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4360.860000000001s)]
*  where you go, Oh, that's what happened. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4365.46s)]
*  Like, were they really good defensively or did they just get really lucky [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4368.02s)]
*  in opponent's makes. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4371.02s)]
*  So that'd be something that I'm like looking for the first few months of next season. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4372.18s)]
*  Would you rather be Golden state or the Quippers the next five years? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4377.18s)]
*  Golden state. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4381.820000000001s)]
*  Cause you get short-term Curry, long-term cap space. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4384.06s)]
*  Curry's the best partner in his era in basketball. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4387.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4390.42s)]
*  And I don't have to worry about the bullshit that you have to worry [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4391.22s)]
*  about with everybody else. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4393.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, I agree. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4395.42s)]
*  The only other team I looked at was Memphis just because of, uh, they gave [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4396.42s)]
*  Jared that extension, he immediately got hurt. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4400.820000000001s)]
*  Um, John Moran just shows how much he's built different though. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4403.42s)]
*  He's just out grinding. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4407.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4408.740000000001s)]
*  Is that non-sanctioned hoops? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4408.9400000000005s)]
*  John Moran. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4411.02s)]
*  No idea what to expect with him. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4412.42s)]
*  Contracts are fine. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4415.1s)]
*  I like some of their young guys. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4416.3s)]
*  They have all their first plus two Orlando first, so they didn't, they didn't make it. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4417.660000000001s)]
*  And then I did look at the Lakers situation for a second, just cause. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4421.3s)]
*  Not when you have one of the three best, it's kind of the [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4426.26s)]
*  honest thing in Milwaukee. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4427.900000000001s)]
*  Like it can be a mess and granted the Lakers future met, but there, there has [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4429.02s)]
*  to be some point of these conversations where we look at each other and go, Oh, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4433.5s)]
*  you have one of the three best players in the world. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4436.46s)]
*  Here's why I paused. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4438.54s)]
*  He is, he is, uh, does not have an extension yet. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4440.22s)]
*  It's the only thing that made me plus [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4447.660000000001s)]
*  how happy you're going to be if he decides to sign somewhere else. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4449.02s)]
*  I don't see any scenario where that happens, but I also, if I was a Laker fan, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4452.14s)]
*  I would be sleeping with one eye open until it happens. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4457.06s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4461.5s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of teams with calf space. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4463.3s)]
*  Give me now that now that everyone's figured out the system, I mean, one of the [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4466.02s)]
*  things I just think the way they, and we've been talking about it for two years, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4470.1s)]
*  but they do the, they change these CBAs and they immediately put in the new rules. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4474.1s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it's like, Hey, the rules have changed. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4477.86s)]
*  It's like, okay, cool. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4479.9s)]
*  Well, we didn't know that when we made all the decisions we've made the last two [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4481.62s)]
*  years, like the Celtics and other teams. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4484.5s)]
*  But I think by the time we get to 26, 27, everyone's going to have a feel for. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4486.74s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4491.0599999999995s)]
*  If I create calf space and I do this and I can make, so he, he's, that could be a [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4491.46s)]
*  really good for agent sweepstakes. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4497.299999999999s)]
*  My assumption is he'll sign an extension in August. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4498.66s)]
*  So I think that's a good thing. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4501.7s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4503.099999999999s)]
*  As I said, sweet stakes. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4504.9800000000005s)]
*  My assumption is so signing an extension in August. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4506.26s)]
*  I'd be shocked if he didn't, but who knows? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4509.660000000001s)]
*  Would it be like a wild card round for the paths or Red Sox? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4514.860000000001s)]
*  If Luca. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4520.620000000001s)]
*  Didn't sign that's not in the level of a banner. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4521.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4524.38s)]
*  So would I trade the pets, couldn't make the playoffs for five years? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4525.860000000001s)]
*  If, but Luca leaves the Lakers. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4530.14s)]
*  Would I take that? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4532.660000000001s)]
*  I think I'd go three years. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4533.58s)]
*  Five's a lot. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4535.58s)]
*  Five's like a half decade. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4536.58s)]
*  I'm old. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4539.58s)]
*  Because you're still so mad that they got him, which is totally understandable. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4540.58s)]
*  There's been some benefits though. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4544.58s)]
*  It definitely created one of the most bizarre LeBron situations. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4548.58s)]
*  I think that's been pretty fun. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4552.58s)]
*  I still don't really get the LeBron thing, you know, because I think it's actually as simple as it needs to be on its surface. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4554.58s)]
*  It's like, so you were mad you didn't get the extension, so you opted in. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4561.58s)]
*  So there was nothing else for you to do. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4566.58s)]
*  There was nowhere for you to make that money. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4568.58s)]
*  And now what? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4570.58s)]
*  Like somebody's going to hear from you about it? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4571.58s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4573.58s)]
*  That one's still a weird deal a week later. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4574.58s)]
*  I think it's as simple as this. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4578.58s)]
*  He is the best NBA player ever to be in a situation like this, where he's on somebody else's team. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4581.58s)]
*  I think it's really that simple. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4589.58s)]
*  Like if I go through the best guys of all time that I have, you know, going down from like Jordan was never in the situation. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4591.58s)]
*  Bill Russell never. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4606.58s)]
*  Kareem never. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4607.58s)]
*  Magic never. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4608.58s)]
*  Bird never. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4609.58s)]
*  Duncan never. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4610.58s)]
*  Will Chamberlain. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4612.58s)]
*  Got traded twice, but even near the end, like they won the title in 72. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4614.58s)]
*  He was on the Lakers. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4619.58s)]
*  He went to the ABA. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4620.58s)]
*  Like he was always controlling his own destiny. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4621.58s)]
*  Curry. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4623.58s)]
*  Kobe. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4624.58s)]
*  Jerry West. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4625.58s)]
*  You finally get to like Hakeem is like the first great guy who was like, oh shit, my team doesn't really seem like they want to build around me and have it be my team anymore. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4627.58s)]
*  So I think that's a really hard thing to deal with. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4639.58s)]
*  It's been like 23 years from the moment Luca showed up. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4642.58s)]
*  And then it was like, Luca, Luca, Luca, and there's jerseys in the thing. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4646.58s)]
*  And they're changing their style on the fly to kind of fit what Luca does. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4649.58s)]
*  I don't know if he's a huge fan. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4654.58s)]
*  You can kind of see it. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4658.58s)]
*  You went to a bunch of Laker games. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4659.58s)]
*  There were moments where he was like, all right, I guess I'll stand over here and Luca is going to do the do the dribble the ball out and then shoot thing. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4660.58s)]
*  So I think it's a hard thing to get used to because it's like the Doug Collins quote where Doug Collins is like the hardest thing to coaches. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4669.58s)]
*  A generational superstar. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4676.58s)]
*  So when they're getting old, it's the hardest thing to coach. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4679.58s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4682.58s)]
*  I don't know what the right situation is for him. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4685.58s)]
*  That's the weird thing. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4687.58s)]
*  Like he was playing basketball in the Cleveland gym. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4688.58s)]
*  I know the other day. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4691.58s)]
*  And yeah, I guess he does that every year. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4692.58s)]
*  It was a non story, but it was also like the timing of it was suspicious because he takes this Instagram. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4694.58s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4699.58s)]
*  I don't know how it plays out. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4701.58s)]
*  He's not getting bought out. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4702.58s)]
*  I'll tell you that much. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4704.58s)]
*  But I think the part it's like, can you not understand why somebody wouldn't want to do like another $54 million option that you control for next year at 42 years old? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4705.58s)]
*  Like, no, hey, we can't keep maxing you off of that number and then have you be in control of it. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4719.58s)]
*  So could you understand that at all? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4728.58s)]
*  And I don't think guys that are this special at stuff. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4731.58s)]
*  They don't they wouldn't. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4734.58s)]
*  Well, you made the key point with Bobby when you were saying. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4736.58s)]
*  This is just something that LeBron chose to do it this way as an employee of a team to keep people in constant suspense whether he's going to stay or go because he felt like. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4741.58s)]
*  By never really fully committing long term, it constantly put pressure on the front office to we got to do this or he might leave. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4752.58s)]
*  This is this goes all the way back to the first Cleveland run when you first started like really like really paying attention. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4763.58s)]
*  And it felt like he and Rich Paul enjoyed. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4770.58s)]
*  Well, it was initially it was I mean, you're going to this is like, yeah, good one. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4775.58s)]
*  But it it played out after that, even with Miami, but it was it was like they wanted you as ownership in the front office to always feel anxiety. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4780.58s)]
*  And I would argue that I think at some point that gets in the way of the partnership. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4794.58s)]
*  Yeah, because it would just lead to some resentment or maybe it didn't. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4800.58s)]
*  You know, I mean, you know, the guy made a million NBA finals. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4804.58s)]
*  So maybe the art, but I just I was a little surprised it was like 2526. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4807.58s)]
*  It was like we're we're going to do this one more time. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4813.58s)]
*  Well, it was weird on the Lakers because they basically did everything he wanted for years. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4816.58s)]
*  Right. They did the Davis trade. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4820.58s)]
*  They got rid of every young guy they had. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4822.58s)]
*  They mortgaged all these picks and and then you're after your deal. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4824.58s)]
*  Yeah, they try to pretend the Westbrook deal wasn't what they wanted. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4828.58s)]
*  You know, they drafted his son. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4832.58s)]
*  They brought in Reddick. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4834.58s)]
*  You know, there's there's maybe a move here or there that they didn't do. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4835.58s)]
*  But for the most part, the coaches have changed a lot. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4839.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like they've been fighting him in every turn. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4842.58s)]
*  Like those guys wanted Vogel out of there. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4846.58s)]
*  And they got, you know, but the reason the Vogel thing didn't work is because he was trying to figure out to make the Westbrook thing work. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4848.58s)]
*  And the Westbrook thing wasn't going to work a million different ways. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4854.58s)]
*  And then LeBron and that camp tried to distance themselves from Westbrook thing being like, yeah, we didn't want to be there. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4857.58s)]
*  You're like, that's not true. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4863.58s)]
*  And then, you know, Darwin Ham comes in and they can't get rid of him quick enough. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4866.58s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4871.58s)]
*  I just I wonder if you could ever have like an honest moment with him. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4874.58s)]
*  You're like, you know, like people have kind of done what you've wanted to all the time. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4877.58s)]
*  Do you find things that you think they're doing wrong? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4881.58s)]
*  I can remember is that summer 2017 when he wanted the Cavs to trade everything, even though everybody knew he was going to go to L.A. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4884.58s)]
*  in a year and the Cavs are the one team like, fuck this, we're not we're not going to do that. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4891.58s)]
*  Commit to an extension and we'll we'll go for this. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4895.58s)]
*  We'll go for Paul George. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4898.58s)]
*  But it was like a lottery pick for like Deandre Jordan shot at that point. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4899.58s)]
*  And you were going like what? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4905.58s)]
*  And then I mean, even the Shabazz Napier thing, Miami is taking them. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4907.58s)]
*  I was thinking about the alternate universe. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4912.58s)]
*  So let's say he opts out. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4915.58s)]
*  I can't believe we're talking about LeBron. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4917.58s)]
*  The ESPN producers are making us do this. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4919.58s)]
*  He he opts out. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4922.58s)]
*  We can't make fun of them next time because we can't. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4924.58s)]
*  We can't. Well, at least we're doing at the end of the podcast. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4926.58s)]
*  He opts out. Right. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4929.58s)]
*  June 30th. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4930.58s)]
*  He's like, I'm out. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4931.58s)]
*  I'm done with the Los Angeles Lakers. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4932.58s)]
*  So it's 53 million. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4935.58s)]
*  But you think like California taxes, agent fee. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4937.58s)]
*  So maybe he's pocketing. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4941.58s)]
*  Twenty four million. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4944.58s)]
*  Right. So he got let's say he goes to Dallas. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4946.58s)]
*  What would Dallas be able to pay him like eight point eight for one year? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4950.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4954.58s)]
*  It was the Angelo Russell deal. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4955.58s)]
*  So he goes to the. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4957.58s)]
*  Yeah. So he gets eight point eight. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4958.58s)]
*  No state taxes in Dallas. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4960.58s)]
*  Maybe he pockets five. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4961.58s)]
*  So he's cost himself 20 million. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4963.58s)]
*  But now he's on Dallas on this awesome team potentially going for the fifth ring. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4967.58s)]
*  Could he have made the money back? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4975.58s)]
*  Would that have been worth it? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4977.58s)]
*  Like he's supposedly a billionaire. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4978.58s)]
*  Like I don't know. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4980.58s)]
*  Would that have been, I wonder if he regrets like the way this played out going, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4981.58s)]
*  Oh man, I actually should have opted out. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4985.58s)]
*  That would have been the baller move to be like, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4987.58s)]
*  fuck it. I'm going to bet on myself. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4989.58s)]
*  I'm going to go in. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4991.58s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to pick my team. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4992.58s)]
*  I'm going to make this a, or he goes to Golden State, right? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4993.58s)]
*  Golden State has some cap space to send some free agents or there's some sign [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4996.58s)]
*  and trade, whatever it is. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4999.58s)]
*  I wonder if he regrets not opting out. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5002.58s)]
*  Cause I think that would have been a smarter move, even though it was, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5005.58s)]
*  you know, you can't tell somebody well. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5007.58s)]
*  Passing up X amount of money, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5009.58s)]
*  but I wonder if he would have been able to make it back. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5011.58s)]
*  But what's making it back for him? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5015.58s)]
*  You know, this is one of those things or the mistake is like, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5017.58s)]
*  why wouldn't you just opt out of it? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5019.58s)]
*  I mean, after this past year and then the next year, 52 million, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5021.58s)]
*  like I'm just looking at it real quick here again, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5025.58s)]
*  that's going to put them at 580 million in career earnings. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5027.58s)]
*  So just for NBA, not even that doesn't talk about all the off the court stuff. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5030.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5035.58s)]
*  So if you were pissed enough about what just went down because it was sort of [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5036.58s)]
*  a weird press release. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5043.58s)]
*  Is what we're doing. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5046.58s)]
*  It wasn't sort of a weird press release. It was weird. It was weird. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5047.58s)]
*  It was weird. Yeah. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5050.58s)]
*  You didn't even really know how to talk about it a week ago because I was like, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5051.58s)]
*  we got to do something about this. And we were kind of like, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5054.58s)]
*  we didn't really know what it was, but we knew it was something. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5056.58s)]
*  Yeah. So if, you know, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5060.58s)]
*  that's the part where you're just not going to have any sympathy for him. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5062.58s)]
*  Cause I'm not, I wouldn't tell anybody, but like, yeah, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5065.58s)]
*  you should have cost yourself 40 million and then you factor in the taxes. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5067.58s)]
*  Maybe it's 35 million, whatever. You should have done that. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5070.58s)]
*  If that was your main priority, but now it's like, okay, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5073.58s)]
*  well you can't say anything. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5075.58s)]
*  Like you can't be upset about anything because you could have had all the [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5077.58s)]
*  freedom you wanted. You could, you could have gone anywhere you wanted. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5080.58s)]
*  And you weren't going to do that because you didn't want to sacrifice the [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5084.58s)]
*  massive contract number. And so, you know, there you go. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5088.58s)]
*  Like it wasn't like they had the team option and they picked it up. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5091.58s)]
*  You decided to do this. So Tom, Tom Brady went to Tampa. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5094.58s)]
*  And I don't, he wasn't full price, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5099.58s)]
*  but it wasn't like what the situation LeBron would have been in where the [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5101.58s)]
*  Brown would have like taken a major discount to go to a contender. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5104.58s)]
*  But you could argue like, if you get that fifth ring, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5108.58s)]
*  you were a big part of a team or if you went to Cleveland or wherever, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5114.58s)]
*  maybe that would have been worth it. I don't know. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5119.58s)]
*  Like at some point he's made so much money. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5121.58s)]
*  What is the difference to me? I have $1.7 billion versus $1.6 million, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5124.58s)]
*  $780,000. Like, I don't know. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5130.58s)]
*  Cause whatever the situation is now, like, let's play it out. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5136.58s)]
*  There's going to be the Lakers haven't said anything for a week. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5141.58s)]
*  We haven't heard anything from anybody. We haven't heard the new owner, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5144.58s)]
*  the old owner. We haven't heard anything from JJ. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5147.58s)]
*  Nobody's even done like a passive aggressive fight back of like, dude, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5149.58s)]
*  he opted in. We expect him to be here in training camp. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5154.58s)]
*  We, he says he wants to be on the Lakers. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5156.58s)]
*  Well, he's on the Lakers and he's the one who asked for the no trade clause. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5159.58s)]
*  And he's the one like we expect to see him on October 1st. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5163.58s)]
*  I don't know what the problem is. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5166.58s)]
*  He's Luca Donchich on his team. We got Deandre Aiden. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5168.58s)]
*  Like we were the third three seed in the West last year. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5172.58s)]
*  What's the problem? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5175.58s)]
*  But nobody said that. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5176.58s)]
*  I just hope he understands. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5183.58s)]
*  He can't send the eyes looking at something emoji before the trade deadline. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5186.58s)]
*  And my guess is that he's probably still going to do something cryptic later on. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5195.58s)]
*  And you're just like, Hey man, the rules are different now. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5201.58s)]
*  Like it's your, if you want a multi-year deal, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5203.58s)]
*  I'm sure plenty of teams that do it, but it's not going to be at 50 million. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5207.58s)]
*  What would be the most amazing? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5211.58s)]
*  I I'm trying to think how this would be more fun from a content standpoint. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5214.58s)]
*  And wouldn't it be Luca being like, it's my team. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5217.58s)]
*  Now he's got to learn how to fit in or like, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5221.58s)]
*  He's 17 years older than I am. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5223.58s)]
*  At some point you've got to recognize that it's a different generation of [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5225.58s)]
*  players moving in or just some sort of thing. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5229.58s)]
*  Now be like, Oh, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5231.58s)]
*  selfishly maybe Lebron for Jaylen Brown. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5233.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5237.58s)]
*  I would, I would, I would ask to come on. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5239.58s)]
*  I would ask to come on. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5242.58s)]
*  We, we would have to come on. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5244.58s)]
*  We would have to come on and work with everyone. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5245.58s)]
*  We would have to be like, Oh, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5248.58s)]
*  you know, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5249.58s)]
*  God, I would, I would, I would ask to come on twice that week with you. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5250.58s)]
*  You just make me do a 24 hour pod. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5255.9s)]
*  Well, that's the other thing. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5259.0199999999995s)]
*  Bobby made the point on your pod that I don't even know what is legal with [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5259.74s)]
*  the trade anymore. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5264.7s)]
*  These rules are so confusing. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5265.5s)]
*  You know, I was wondering like, is could you just trade Jimmy Butler for LeBron? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5268.12s)]
*  Their salaries are almost exactly the same. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5272.1s)]
*  Apparently you can't. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5274.3s)]
*  No, Jimmy. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5276.38s)]
*  Um, well, Bobby, Bobby was just so good this week, man. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5277.740000000001s)]
*  So I really appreciate you liking that pod. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5281.58s)]
*  Cause we got done and I went, God, he fucking killed it today. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5283.58s)]
*  And Bobby was joking that he wanted to have like pre-recorded sounders for us. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5287.18s)]
*  Because we just pressed a button. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5291.780000000001s)]
*  You and Zach. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5294.3s)]
*  Oh, that triggers the second apron. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5295.26s)]
*  Zach might not need it. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5296.820000000001s)]
*  Do we need, is there an AI Bobby? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5298.46s)]
*  Could we do AI? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5299.9800000000005s)]
*  That should be an app that he invents and you can just download all the soundbites [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5301.62s)]
*  where he's just like, that would put you in the first apron. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5305.98s)]
*  But since it's aggregated, you know, he just, but then again, we'd have to know [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5308.42s)]
*  that that was happening live as you were bullshitting about all these different [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5311.9s)]
*  things. But the best point, the one that you were going to make there is that [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5314.26s)]
*  poor Bobby gets aggregated by ESPN by saying there's no market for LeBron. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5317.54s)]
*  Then it goes on to explain why there's no market for LeBron. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5321.82s)]
*  Nobody can trade for him. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5325.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5326.5s)]
*  It looks really bad when you've got one of your most plugged in guys saying, but [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5326.86s)]
*  it's kind of back to the Cleveland thing that we were talking about last week. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5331.62s)]
*  And we should probably finish this topic at this point, because I don't know how [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5334.66s)]
*  much more I have left on it. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5337.3s)]
*  Is it as great as he continues to be this latest career? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5338.38s)]
*  I can't give up multi-year assets for a guy that I get. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5341.98s)]
*  I get when you're in your prime and you're not an awesome partner for a team. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5347.099999999999s)]
*  But I can't have you north of 40 fucking with me like you're 28. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5352.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5357.099999999999s)]
*  Hey, what do you want to do next year? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5357.66s)]
*  What would you like to do? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5359.94s)]
*  Do you want it? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5361.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5361.98s)]
*  All right. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5362.3s)]
*  You want to keep, you want to keep everything? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5362.58s)]
*  All right. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5364.42s)]
*  So that means if we're paying you this, we're paying Luca this, and we got to [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5364.74s)]
*  worry about the extension of Luca and then Austin, the whole thing, chances are [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5367.9800000000005s)]
*  we're not like they were lucky to be able to even get eight. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5371.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5375.02s)]
*  I don't even think that's necessarily like a bad team next year. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5376.02s)]
*  Um, well, you know, it is. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5379.14s)]
*  It's a bill Duffy team. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5381.9800000000005s)]
*  Solo agent changing the guard to the Duffy guys are coming into the Lakers. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5384.02s)]
*  Clutch had their seven year run. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5390.38s)]
*  Now, now it's bill Duffy's time. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5392.3s)]
*  KCP and a one year 20 something. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5394.219999999999s)]
*  Uh, the eighth thing happened after I did my pot on Wednesday. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5398.82s)]
*  You got to talk about on Thursday. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5401.86s)]
*  I just like, there's no more fascinating center you could throw on the Lakers [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5403.379999999999s)]
*  with LeBron and with Luca that where there's more scenarios at play. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5408.98s)]
*  I just, I thought he was, uh, really tough to take in Portland and the [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5412.78s)]
*  Phoenix people clearly had enough of them. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5417.98s)]
*  And we've, I've, I've followed the NBA enough with my life that usually. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5420.0199999999995s)]
*  Guys who show a certain set of behavior for season after season, it doesn't [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5425.259999999999s)]
*  just miraculously change when they're 27. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5430.099999999999s)]
*  With all that said, the guy puts up points and rebounds and they kind of, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5433.299999999999s)]
*  they needed somebody who can just go 15 and 10 every game. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5436.5s)]
*  You know, it's he, even having him not giving a shit in the Minnesota [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5440.379999999999s)]
*  series last year still would have been better than what they had. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5444.219999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5447.379999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5448.219999999999s)]
*  If he could actually give a shit for three of the seven games of a series, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5449.54s)]
*  it's still three more than whatever they had before. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5454.099999999999s)]
*  So I didn't mind it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5456.46s)]
*  Uh, we'll see if LeBron can resurrect him. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5458.38s)]
*  He was able to resurrect. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5460.7s)]
*  JR Smith. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5462.5s)]
*  There was, there was some, you know, distressed assets that he [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5464.3s)]
*  was able to pull stuff out of. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5468.42s)]
*  I don't know if it'll happen with eight, but it was certainly a better outcome [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5471.5s)]
*  than I think what we're looking at. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5475.58s)]
*  When you're looking at the free agent centers and like, uh, it's a total win. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5478.98s)]
*  And I'm going to give Lakers, uh, media. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5484.5s)]
*  I went looking for the pieces. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5487.62s)]
*  I went looking for the pro eight and new stop there. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5489.86s)]
*  He's going to feed off of Luca. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5494.26s)]
*  He's going to feed off LeBron. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5495.78s)]
*  JJ's always loved his, his skillset, the foundation of his skills. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5497.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5502.42s)]
*  There's still a chance that it happens, but I went looking for it this week to [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5503.139999999999s)]
*  hate read it. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5507.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was going to be so entertained by being like, you're just talking [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5508.259999999999s)]
*  yourself and his credit to all the light. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5511.7s)]
*  I went through a lot of Laker stuff, locally sourced. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5514.179999999999s)]
*  Blog media, good media group. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5517.9s)]
*  Really great work out of you guys. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5520.339999999999s)]
*  Strain everybody. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5523.0199999999995s)]
*  Congrats. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5524.339999999999s)]
*  Nobody's doing one thing. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5525.259999999999s)]
*  I didn't read one delusional eight and thing, which I was disappointed by. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5526.54s)]
*  I was hoping to be entertained and it wasn't even out there. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5530.299999999999s)]
*  So good job. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5533.179999999999s)]
*  Nobody writing that once upon a time, a guy named Robert parish was [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5534.58s)]
*  traded to the Boston Celtics. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5538.299999999999s)]
*  Much maligned for his work ethic, a lot like Deandre eight and he became a hall [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5541.139999999999s)]
*  of Famer I like, there was some stuff floating around about how Deandre and [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5546.66s)]
*  Luca, cause they were in the same draft and Deandre had some positive Luca [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5551.0599999999995s)]
*  comments and, um, I actually think it's not an awesome offensive basketball fit [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5555.259999999999s)]
*  for how he plays with, I think, um, just hypothetically, whatever, he's [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5561.179999999999s)]
*  less of a lob guy and he's more of a spot guy. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5568.179999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5571.54s)]
*  Now, can you just say, Hey dude, have you looked in the mirror recently? [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5572.179999999999s)]
*  Just, can you go catch some of these lobs from Luca? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5575.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5579.46s)]
*  Can, can we show you a tape of a hundred lobs that you dunked over [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5579.62s)]
*  the course of your career? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5583.099999999999s)]
*  You and I were on, I think we, we had probably more patients for him than most [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5584.0599999999995s)]
*  because we really respected that finals run that he had and some of the [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5590.0199999999995s)]
*  stuff he did defensively it's in there. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5593.98s)]
*  But those are the kinds of guys that break your hearts. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5596.7s)]
*  Cause you know, it's in there because every time I read and look, the, the [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5599.0599999999995s)]
*  signings now are reading like press releases from the agencies and this has [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5605.459999999999s)]
*  been going on for a long time. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5609.139999999999s)]
*  And I understand why we do it or why we have it because the agent wants to get [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5610.379999999999s)]
*  his name in there on the transaction. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5614.0599999999995s)]
*  And then when the agent is the one doing the favor to the insider. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5615.66s)]
*  So I can't even really get mad at the insiders, but like, you'll go through [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5618.22s)]
*  and just want to read a story about a guy signing somewhere like, Hey, what [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5621.42s)]
*  could I not be thinking of something that I missed, you know, like I haven't, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5624.34s)]
*  I've been watching every single eight and game his entire career. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5627.54s)]
*  And then you run through the ones that come out and they're all, you can [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5630.62s)]
*  tell they're like written by the agency. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5634.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5636.3s)]
*  And by the time you're done with the eight and one, you're like, holy [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5636.62s)]
*  shit, this guy's amazing. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5639.34s)]
*  How many is only 19 guys ever average 15 and 10 their first six seasons? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5643.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5648.54s)]
*  There's, there's some number that's like, he's the first guy or he's one of only [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5648.9400000000005s)]
*  like seven guys to start their career or 10 and 10, which, you know, is still a [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5653.18s)]
*  pretty impressive rebounding number. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5658.1s)]
*  It's not impressive scoring number, but there was about three or four lines in [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5659.54s)]
*  one of the stories that I read about him and you get done with like the last [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5663.22s)]
*  portion of it and you're thinking, I can't believe this guy was available. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5666.700000000001s)]
*  He's 26 and you're like, what a date. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5670.38s)]
*  Like think about everything that you just read and that Portland was still [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5673.18s)]
*  like, we're good. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5677.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5678.54s)]
*  Paragraph 12 is Portland paid him $25 million to go away at 26 years old. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5678.74s)]
*  Then they have a defensive identity, but even Chauncey was like, please. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5687.38s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5694.78s)]
*  Um, they got him. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5695.54s)]
*  I really liked the Lora. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5696.78s)]
*  I, as you know, like Lora via, um, I don't know if he would have been my [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5698.54s)]
*  number one target in for agency, but I, I do like them. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5702.5s)]
*  I think he's going to play for them. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5705.34s)]
*  And, um, all the Laker fans who were telling us all summer, they were going [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5707.3s)]
*  to trade Reeves for a center, like as always like, okay, here's a list of [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5710.900000000001s)]
*  the centers who you getting and, uh, unless you're going to try to trade [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5715.14s)]
*  them for Nick Claxton, which I don't, I wouldn't recommend the centers. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5719.14s)]
*  Uh, don't really exist anyway. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5723.38s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5726.1s)]
*  That's it for us. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5726.46s)]
*  Uh, you're so both of us are kind of cutting back this summer, but you will [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5727.42s)]
*  be on the Braveheart rewatchables at some point this summer. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5733.18s)]
*  You promised. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5735.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I promised. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5737.34s)]
*  I just don't know if that's a on location one where I'll be. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5738.34s)]
*  We're already off to a rough start, unfortunately on some of the planning, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5743.5s)]
*  but that's okay. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5748.42s)]
*  All, all good things. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5749.34s)]
*  Nothing to complain about. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5750.780000000001s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5752.5s)]
*  Was that Braveheart? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5753.700000000001s)]
*  I'll be thrilled to do that. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5754.66s)]
*  Cause I just had those three Scots on that are rowing from Peru to Sydney. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5755.900000000001s)]
*  And one of the questions that I had prepped up was, do you guys watch [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5760.540000000001s)]
*  Braveheart regularly during the tough days? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5763.540000000001s)]
*  Cause they're on like day 90 now. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5766.620000000001s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5768.540000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe we do a Twitter poll. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5769.820000000001s)]
*  Would you rather hear Rossello on a Braveheart rewatchables or Casablanca? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5771.38s)]
*  Cause fantasy said, fantasy said he would waive his $53 million, uh, player option [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5778.5s)]
*  and signed for the vet minimum. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5785.820000000001s)]
*  If we did Casablanca, I'm going to be, I'm [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5787.26s)]
*  not doing this as like fake humble. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5789.94s)]
*  I want you three to do Casablanca and I don't want to be on it. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5791.94s)]
*  I think you guys are so fucking good that I, I just don't think, I don't [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5795.379999999999s)]
*  think it makes sense for me to come on and make my jokes and be a dick about [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5800.7s)]
*  some things or, you know, I don't want to get in the way. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5805.139999999999s)]
*  Maybe African queen. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5808.0199999999995s)]
*  You come on. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5809.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I could do African queen. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5810.54s)]
*  I loved that movie when I was a kid. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5812.419999999999s)]
*  I was like, this Bogart guy's got something. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5814.82s)]
*  Bogart and Hepburn. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5816.74s)]
*  What a combo. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5818.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5820.62s)]
*  It's just that boat had its challenges. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5821.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's, I didn't even realize how passionate I would be about nautical stuff. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5823.82s)]
*  How's this boat going to make it? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5829.5s)]
*  Rossello, good to see you. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5831.46s)]
*  Thanks to Gahau and Eduardo as well. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5832.62s)]
*  New rewatchables coming tomorrow. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5834.7s)]
*  We did Jaws 2, so stay tuned for that. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5837.179999999999s)]
*  And you're not going to see me on this podcast until next Sunday. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5839.259999999999s)]
*  So, uh, enjoy the rest of the week. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5841.62s)]
