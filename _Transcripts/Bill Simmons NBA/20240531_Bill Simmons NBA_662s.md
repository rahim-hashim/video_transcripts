# The History of the NBA’s Best Player Belt. Is Luka About to Take It? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JZ-cVdf3LA)
*  All right. Here's the championship belt. I went back to the year after bill russell retired
*  Smart year. It's good year to do it and the belt was vacant for a year after bill russell retired
*  We didn't know there's a couple of vacant years i'm sorry
*  Then kareem gets it in in 71 the box one of the best player in the world best player in the world belt, right?
*  Okay kareem has it unquestionably in 71 71 bucks one of the best teams of all time
*  Wilt takes it back with the 72 lakers. They had the 33 game winning streak
*  They win the finals. He grabs it back kareem then grabs it back and kareem has it for
*  Depending on how you feel about rick barry in 1975 when gold state
*  Uh when they ran the slate they won the title he was 30 points a game, but I kind of feel like kareem had this
*  really until 76 now
*  interesting belt piece here
*  Julius is in the aba
*  Stringing together titles and I think julius even though he's in the aba has it in 76. I gotta give it to him
*  Just watching the tapes. I think he has it 77 bill walton grabs it with the portland trailblazers
*  He's just dominates kicking ass then he gets hurt
*  belts vacant
*  We're now vacant for the 78 playoffs 79 playoffs nobody knows who the best players
*  In the 80s 1980 kareem Abdul-jabbar grabs it back
*  Heroic win against the sixers plays on the sprained echo game five. So he has it
*  Somewhere
*  Somewhere 8182 range moses grabs it. Thank you moses has it
*  Moses has it
*  Maybe when he beats the lakers in 81 and takes this crappy rockets team to the finals by himself
*  I think he has it at that point
*  has it in 82
*  Gets traded the sixers one of the best seasons of all time. So he has it 383
*  Then bird has it 84 to 87
*  Magic steals it from him in the 87 finals magic has it 87 88
*  89 range jordan grabs it jordan has it 90 91 92 93
*  Wait, can we just back up to the bird magic thing magic was never considered the best player in the world prior to 1987
*  No bird was the bird won three straight mvps. I know he did i'm aware
*  And it he was the best and then magic beating him in the finals magic took it
*  And then magic had it magic won three mvps in four years
*  Then jordan has it
*  Jordan goes to play baseball hakeem's like thanks. I'll take the belt and he has it for two years
*  Jordan comes back. I'll take it back. He has it for three
*  1999 lockout year vacant
*  No belt holder i'm not giving it to tim duncan who wins the title that year
*  He wasn't quite tim duncan that i'm not giving it to
*  2000 shack
*  2001 shack
*  Duncan has it from 02 I think 307
*  There's some uh, maybe dwayne wade there and oh six now
*  Duncan was the best part in the league. I think for six years
*  Right, do you disagree with that?
*  you're not going to get any disagreement from this guy when it comes to praising tim duncan status because
*  Like it just felt like hey
*  They go through the playoffs when they didn't win the title
*  And it was always something stupid. Yeah, right. And so
*  I I love it personally. I look there's going to be some kobe stuff
*  but
*  Shack towards the end like it was kind of over by 05 06
*  He wasn't a belt holder. He was on even though kobe so you can make a case for kobe in 06
*  And if you want to make the case i'm fine with it when kobe averaged 35 a game
*  And duncan didn't make the finals and if you want to say kobe grabbed it for a year
*  I'm not going to fight it
*  but that team did lose
*  I think in round one or round two that kobe team but
*  So, you know what? Let's give it to kobe in 06 and then back to duncan 07
*  I like the duncan because it couldn't be just a year. I just don't want to hear like oh he won it
*  He lost it. He wanted he lost the one eight lives. He was he was the most important player in the league for a really long time
*  So i'm glad you did it. All right, so we'll give it duncan 0207
*  kobe grabs it
*  I think he has it in the 08 season even though they don't win the title and then he has it
*  09 10 so he has it for those three years
*  um
*  And I 2011 might be vacant
*  And then dirt shows up at that point. I think lebron's the best player in the league at that point
*  But not in the finals. So I think dirk has it. I think they're
*  Finals, but see this is going to be my point as we close because this is where it gets really interesting
*  It can't just be revolving belt of who had won titles
*  But if dirk beats him in the finals, I don't know how you could say lebron is the belt
*  Because I think he's the best player in the world
*  Nobody thought dirk was the best player in the world when he won that title was an awesome run good for dirk
*  Great underdog story, but lebron did win the mvp in 11
*  2011 so maybe it's kobe. I don't know. I I almost feel like 2011 it's either dirk or vacant for me
*  Is that the rose here? Wait, is that the word your rose won the mvp? Yeah, but he wasn't the I wouldn't have said
*  He was the best player there. So maybe we go vacant then lebron grabs and lebron has it
*  You could say he has it from 2012 to 2018
*  Is there a durant case for you at any point
*  My durant case was going to be right around this time, okay, so 17 18
*  No, it was going to be a little bit later. It was
*  When we started having the yanis argument and I think more people were on the yanis is the best player in the world
*  Mode and I felt like what kd did with the nets even though they lost in milwaukee
*  I lingered I lingered with that and then I finally relented because I just felt like wait a minute
*  Why would I watch somebody play basketball the way durant does offensively and then think yanis is better?
*  Than him considering the level of skill like I think that's why there's always been this odd
*  It's never as bad as rudy with the american players, but I think a lot of the american players would look at yanis and go, okay
*  Yeah, but there's not like all this crazy stuff in there and then finally it was like yeah
*  But his intensity from the moment he steps on the floor to his his overpowering of you and the fact that it worked
*  You know yanis is an entirely different conversation if he doesn't make all of his free throws
*  In that closing game
*  In that closing game, but I mean the guy went for 50 in a closing game to win a title so
*  I think there's I know personally I was arguing durant longer than than I should have been
*  But I still think there were some durant moments in there
*  So you wouldn't have gone his first two warrior seasons you never durant was never the best part of the world to you
*  It was always still lebron at that point because I think you can make a real case for duran in 17
*  Um, you can but it's cheapened by the fact that he's playing with the guy that's number two in the world
*  Right. And so the funny thing about steph winning the mvps. I never once thought that steph was actually the better player than lebron
*  But it's a regular season award, right? Um, curry's never in here for you at any point with the belt
*  As much as we love him
*  I I agree. Yeah, I don't I don't think there was ever a point where I said
*  He is if they had won it in 16 maybe before durant, you know, that would have been back-to-back titles
*  He would have won another mvp
*  There's a chance you could make the case
*  But I still think with lebron being in the league at that point still in his prime like
*  I love curry everybody knows that I never thought he was actually a better single basketball player than lebron was so no
*  He does actually I don't think there's any moment that he has the belt
*  All right. So we'll give lebron 11 18. I think kawaii 100 has in 2018
*  He won the belt. He was the best part in the world, but the end of that season he just was
*  I normally don't like doing that but he he just yeah. Yeah, we're cool. We're cool on that. Um
*  2020 bubble year. I almost want to go vacant too weird
*  This is where i'm in my durant phase, but go ahead but then you know, he's not playing enough. He's hurt
*  No, he didn't even yeah, he was hurt
*  I'm just talking about like the overall like status of who was where and this is I get it. This is
*  Um
*  I do think yanis
*  In the 2021 finals through the 22 playoffs probably had it and then yokich took it
*  And now
*  Luca has a chance to grab it or at least it's a conversation with him versus yokich
*  Because I don't know what else yokich could have done in the uh, in the playoffs
*  He's pretty unbelievable. So I hate dinging him on it
*  Um, but if luca rips through the seltzer's team, which I think is a better team than dallas
*  But if luca will be the reason they win
*  And if he can beat them
*  I think we have to have the conversation
*  Well, the conversation has already started it will be had I just don't like the finality of it because that's not what this is
*  I know we're going to talk tatum a little bit later today
*  but
*  That tatum is kind of hard to pin down
*  When I don't think it's that hard to pin it down
*  But because you can't really just slot him, you know, he's not easy to slot that that means there should be more conversation about it
*  Like even if luca wins
*  It it will be like this is why I always hated like some of the heisman stuff or people saying like oh
*  You should have the mvp vote after the playoffs like well if we did that then the only time anybody would ever win the mvp
*  Is whoever the best player was on the team that won the mba finals
*  And that's not really what the award is supposed to be if you want it to be that
*  Then go ahead and just come up with a different award
*  But it will not matter what you do in the regular season at all
*  And maybe that's the whole point but I just don't think it makes any sense same thing with the heisman
*  Some quarterback has a huge game national title didn't win the heisman and people like oh he should win the heisman. You're like well wait
*  What the fuck are we doing?
*  So if luca gets through boston and wins this
*  I would say more of the basketball media would be willing to anoint him the best player in the world because it's sexy and it's fun
*  To say when I know i'll be waiting i'll be like I gotta I gonna need another year before i'm ready to put somebody over
*  Yokich and maybe it's that third quarter in game five
*  1970 vacant kareem wilt kareem again
*  Julius walton 78 79 vacant kareem moses bird magic jordan hakeem jordan again
*  1999 vacant shak duncan six years koby
*  Lebron eight years
*  Rossella says duran i i veto that one kawaii
*  Bacon yanis yokich
*  We'll see you about luca
