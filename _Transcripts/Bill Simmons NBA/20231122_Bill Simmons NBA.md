# Bill Officially Likes the In-Season Tournament | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MB4twHvO2M)
*  I officially like the in-season tournament.
*  I think I'm in.
*  I don't know whether this is,
*  you know, they just poured Kool-Aid down my throat
*  or I'm just following the herd
*  or they're playing a Jedi mind trick on me.
*  But tonight was the night where
*  I actually was legitimately invested
*  in who won the Indiana-Atlanta game,
*  which also happened to be an incredible game.
*  And I actually looked at the schedule before we popped on
*  and was like, oh, Boston, Orlando,
*  Friday in the in-season, that's a big one.
*  And we've hit this point now where
*  the players care, so I care.
*  That's where I've landed.
*  And the best part isn't even here yet, right?
*  The single elimination actual tournament part
*  of the tournament hasn't even arrived.
*  So, you know, there's a lot of inertia in sports in general,
*  a lot of stodgy old men in dusty rooms
*  complaining about things not changing
*  because of the way they've always been.
*  So I am pro experimentation.
*  Trying new things is cool.
*  LeBron caring about these games is cool.
*  Michael Imperioli is cool.
*  Like, I'm down for every element we've gotten of this so far.
*  And again, the best is yet to come
*  in terms of what these games are gonna actually look like
*  when elimination is on the line.
*  You know what I realized,
*  especially watching the games today,
*  these guys have been competing their whole lives.
*  And even though this is a pretty dubious prize,
*  it's basically like, hey, everybody wins $500,000
*  you're gonna hold this cup that will probably be called
*  like the Amazon cup next year, whatever it is.
*  It's still winning something.
*  These guys are all still competitive.
*  They're on a plane every night.
*  They're playing cards.
*  They're playing video games.
*  They've been competing their whole lives.
*  And this is just another thing.
*  I didn't think it fell into place in my head
*  until I heard Halliburton talking about it.
*  And he was just like, I've never won anything.
*  He had this whole monologue about it.
*  He's like, I care about this.
*  I wanna make the tournament.
*  Totally.
*  I wanna make Vegas.
*  I wanna try to win this thing.
*  I've never won anything before.
*  And I was like, oh, okay.
*  So when you're just talking about a year one of something
*  and there's been a lot of bad year ones of TV shows,
*  technological products, you name it,
*  this is a pretty good start.
*  The courts made it feel different.
*  We all made fun of them, but you are aware of,
*  oh, this is actually an end season.
*  So from that piece, it worked.
*  The way they matched up all the teams
*  seems to have worked for the most part.
*  It's not really totally divisions,
*  but it feels like people are in the same vicinity.
*  And then I actually kind of understand the brackets.
*  Like I was looking at them on ESPN or Lando today.
*  They're trying to win their game and it's like,
*  oh, maybe they should win by more points
*  in case they don't end up winning their bracket.
*  They wanna get one of the two wild card spots.
*  So they've checked a lot of boxes.
*  What's missing for you so far about,
*  like going into year two,
*  what do you wish was in here that we don't have yet?
*  It's a great question.
*  Honestly, it's working for me for the most part.
*  I think some of the courts can be tamed down a smidge.
*  Some of the reds are quite red, quite intense.
*  And if we hear a little closer to what we saw
*  in Atlanta's court tonight, for example,
*  I think that's the best court to sign
*  this beautiful baby blue number that works really well
*  for having actual basketball players
*  on the court playing on it.
*  The more we can get in that range,
*  I think the better off will be,
*  but I like the distinctive look.
*  I like the fact that guys are caring about this.
*  And right now they're caring about it
*  on more of a cerebral level.
*  Like it's LeBron saying,
*  I wanna win $500,000 for my teammates.
*  It's Damian Lillard saying,
*  I wanna win this for the guys
*  who are not making as much as I am.
*  But you're right,
*  like once you get into the third quarter
*  of some of these elimination games
*  and your team is down 12,
*  where normally in the regular season,
*  you might just kind of coast it out and see what happens.
*  Maybe you take your stars out if it gets away from you.
*  Now I think a lot of these teams
*  are gonna be cranking it up
*  and you're getting to that point in those competitive games
*  where it's not just about, as you're saying,
*  these guys wanna win,
*  they really don't wanna lose.
*  They really don't wanna lose.
*  And the fact that I think we have the currency of attention
*  on the tournament right now.
*  There is a lot of push media-wise,
*  advertising-wise to make this a thing.
*  And the more the league succeeds
*  in getting people to care about this on the outside,
*  the more it's gonna feel like a real lost opportunity
*  for the guys in the teams who get eliminated.
*  Yeah, I thought Doc Rivers,
*  that was when I started to get sucked in
*  when he was talking about it in my podcast last week
*  and explaining from a coach's perspective why he liked it
*  and how it's just added stakes
*  that now you can test your team in certain ways
*  and cut your rotation and do things
*  to kind of prepare yourself
*  for what it's gonna look like in April.
*  So that part's fun.
*  I think when we get to Vegas,
*  you think this was a league
*  that just stopped battering in December for the most part,
*  unless somebody scored 60 points
*  or there was a really awesome Friday-esque pen game
*  for the most part.
*  There was talk two years ago,
*  like should we just start the season on Christmas?
*  And should we just, remember, everybody was like,
*  why doesn't the NBA matter more the first eight weeks?
*  Why does it feel like the season starts on Christmas?
*  I think the league was terrified.
*  You look at some of the stuff
*  that they've done the last couple years
*  where even moving the TNT games to Tuesday nights,
*  just to avoid the NFL completely,
*  it was a league that was a little bit on the ropes here
*  this first part of the season.
*  And now the Vegas thing will be something.
*  Everyone's gonna care.
*  I feel like all the NBA people will be there.
*  And I feel like we're like,
*  we sound like we're drinking the Kool-Aid,
*  but I was fully prepared to be shitting on this
*  and like, oh, this didn't work.
*  What should the stakes be?
*  I think if I had to add one thing,
*  I think it would be cool if the team that won
*  was guaranteed a playoff spot.
*  Yeah.
*  So, and whether that's the sixth seed.
*  So let's say Indiana actually wins this whole thing
*  and you're just guaranteed no lower than the sixth seed.
*  That's something.
*  Now you're really playing for something.
*  Maybe that means less to the Celtics
*  because the Celtics know they're gonna be good.
*  But I think for some of the other teams,
*  like in Orlando, like in Indiana, that's a real thing.
*  You're going full tilt now for that.
*  If they guaranteed the eighth seed, that's not bad either.
*  And maybe you say the play-in is for seven seed only
*  in one of the conferences.
*  Like there's ways to rig that.
*  But I do wish that, I wish they added that stake.
*  Are you for or against that?
*  I'm for maybe a modified version of that.
*  I think what I'd like to see is maybe you get a bump up
*  from wherever you end up.
*  So if you're in the bottom four of the standings,
*  you're automatically in the play-in.
*  If you end up in the play-in,
*  you're automatically guaranteed a top eight.
*  Oh, that's good.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You know, if you're, and if you're a top 16,
*  maybe you're guaranteed home court advantage
*  for a certain number of rounds
*  or certain number of opponents.
*  That way we're not getting the Portland Trail Blazers
*  with all due respect in a first round series
*  just getting absolutely wrecked by the Nuggets or something.
*  Right.
*  Everything is still like above board and competitive,
*  but it's a real reward for these teams who are vying for it.
*  Rob, I don't think we have to worry
*  about the Portland Trail Blazers
*  in any sort of scenario this season
*  that doesn't involve deep, deep, deep embedded lottery.
