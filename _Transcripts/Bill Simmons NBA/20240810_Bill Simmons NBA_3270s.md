# Steph Curry Saves the Day (and Team USA) With Doc Rivers  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7PFPeqY03I)
*  Just watched USA beat France in the gold medal game.
*  Doc Rivers was there for a couple of the early round games,
*  but this seemed like we were headed toward the LeBron,
*  this is the whole thing, and Curry had this big game
*  against Serbia down the stretch,
*  and then four threes down the stretch
*  against a frisky France team,
*  and it became one of the greatest moments of his career,
*  including the last three that he hit.
*  I think might have been the best three
*  I've ever seen him hit.
*  He was being double teamed,
*  and the shot clock flings it up,
*  but you can't be surprised by this shit anymore,
*  but this has to be way up there for him, right?
*  Where would you put it?
*  Yeah, yeah, one, the significance,
*  the game in Boston, the closeout game,
*  where that's a world championship or NBA championship,
*  I don't want, what is it, Noah Lott will get mad at me.
*  But when you think about it on this stage, Bill,
*  he makes those shots with what he has on the floor.
*  He has Kevin Durant, he has all these guys around him,
*  and they were watching him play at the very end,
*  and I thought it was really cool watching Devin Booker
*  and all the guys on the sideline,
*  like doing the shot, earshot like as a kid,
*  that's how impressed they were.
*  It was awesome to watch, I mean, he just took the game over,
*  took the last two games over.
*  Well, if you drew up the Olympics beforehand
*  and you're like, here's what we're doing,
*  we're gonna have all the best young guys here,
*  but we're also gonna have LeBron, because he's 39,
*  we're gonna have Curry, who has been in the limelight
*  in two years, and we're gonna have KD,
*  who hasn't really had a big playoff moment
*  in the last five years, but is the best Olympic basketball
*  player we've ever had.
*  We're actually gonna build the team around
*  these three older guys and keep our fingers crossed
*  that all of them have moments down the stretch
*  of the medal rounds, and it happened.
*  LeBron had the car keys for the whole tournament,
*  KD hit some big shots, had the biggest shot
*  of the Serbia game, and Steph was kind of the closer
*  both times, but just as a pure basketball fan,
*  I mean, watching those guys have been in the league
*  for so long, these superstars, but watching the LeBron Curry,
*  that little pick and roll play they ran at the top,
*  where does that rank for you for craziest,
*  most unstoppable, like what do you do?
*  What's the defense supposed to do on that play?
*  You know, it was so funny, I was sitting there,
*  because I watched the game as a fan,
*  but I'm a coach, and you can't get it out of you.
*  You know, the Lakers with Darwin ran a lot of that
*  pick and roll with Reeves, and it was really good,
*  because Reeves was such a great roller,
*  he could slip out and roll, LeBron would roll,
*  but with Curry, that's a whole different ball game.
*  They didn't want to switch it, they kept switching it.
*  The first thing I would have put a guard on LeBron,
*  because they had a bigger guy on LeBron,
*  just because you knew it was coming,
*  at least a guard guard, you have a fighting chance
*  to guard Steph, and if they get it to LeBron,
*  you know, he's inside the two, you live with it,
*  but man, is it a hard play to guard.
*  You know, it's funny, a lot of things stood out
*  in this whole run by the Olympic team,
*  but what stands out to me every time, Bill,
*  and you kind of hit on it, is the old guard.
*  The young guys, if you remember in the early rounds,
*  Anthony Edwards was the leading scorer,
*  and all the young guys were the dominant players,
*  and the old guys kind of sat around and like, you know,
*  enjoy, but when it came to winning time, it all changed.
*  They couldn't get it quick enough into Steph's hands,
*  into Katie's hands, into LeBron's hands.
*  Right.
*  I remember the first Olympics that they won back
*  after we had lost a couple, the same thing happened,
*  but LeBron and Waite were young,
*  and then at the very end of the Olympics,
*  Kobe saved the day, he was the vet,
*  and they gave it to him, save us, please.
*  That's how this felt as well.
*  The other thing, and I've said this
*  probably LeBron's entire career,
*  if LeBron could just be a point guard, how good he would be.
*  And in the Olympics, he basically was just the point guard.
*  You know, that was his position.
*  He played point guard for most of the Olympics,
*  and his passing and his basketball IQ,
*  it just set everything up for everyone.
*  He was amazing.
*  The last thing, and I think the unsung hero
*  in the entire Olympics was Devin Booker.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I don't think he got enough credit
*  because he picked up full court
*  every second he was on the floor.
*  I thought he was the difference-making Serbian
*  with his ball pressure.
*  As a matter of fact, I thought the US,
*  the difference in the game against Serbia
*  and the difference tonight is the guard play
*  and the US ability to pressure the ball
*  and turn the ball and get teams out of their offense.
*  But that was my take just watching them all.
*  KD is a different player, man,
*  when he plays with all these other guys.
*  He doesn't force much.
*  He kind of lets it come to him.
*  And the last thing is a lot of guys will benefit from this.
*  You know, Joel Embiid, who I thought struggled
*  and was on and off, up and down with the Olympics,
*  will be a better player.
*  All of them will be better players.
*  All the young guys, Anthony Edwards will be a better player.
*  Because number one, I don't care where you win.
*  When you win, you learn a lot of stuff.
*  You learn, number one, how hard it is.
*  And I think they will all take that back to their teams.
*  And they will all understand winning is hard
*  and a lot of stuff has to go right.
*  I mean, think about the game against Serbia.
*  Serbia has the ball wide open up to with 54 seconds left
*  and they missed that three.
*  If they make that three, we're in trouble.
*  You know, it just tells you how many things
*  have to go right to win a game.
*  Even when you're that good,
*  things still have to go right for you.
*  Yeah, you called it winning time.
*  I call it nut crunch time.
*  You had a lot of good stuff for there.
*  I'm gonna try to unpack a couple of things.
*  The LeBron point, which I talked about a couple podcasts ago,
*  but I want your take on it.
*  So, you know, when he's coming in the league
*  and then the 2000s and it's like, here's a guy,
*  there's some magic in here, there's some Dr. J
*  and there's some Jordan.
*  And he's kind of a hybrid of all these guys,
*  but there's a lot of magic in here.
*  Where is this gonna go?
*  And then eventually he became a hybrid
*  of a whole bunch of different people
*  and he formed his own style.
*  But there was always that magic piece.
*  They were like, hey, it would have been really interesting
*  just if you just reset his career
*  and watched him just go the magic way.
*  The way he played, or at least tried to play,
*  especially in the middle rounds,
*  was like kind of early mid-80s magic
*  before Kareem got older.
*  Magic had to be the go-to guy, you know what I mean?
*  His facilitators, trying to push the ball,
*  trying to constantly attack,
*  but was okay not having the scoring burden.
*  And it's just an interesting what if,
*  because this is also the guy who leads the league
*  in the history for points.
*  And it's like, hey, here's this other thing
*  he could have done.
*  It actually made me more amazed
*  by the career he's had, you know?
*  Yeah, he's had the greatest career.
*  I say it all the time.
*  Obviously I feel Michael is the greatest player,
*  but that doesn't matter.
*  He's not taking anything away from LeBron.
*  I don't think anyone's gonna have a career,
*  maybe in our lifetime, like LeBron.
*  I don't see it coming.
*  Now, guys are playing longer,
*  but can they stay healthy?
*  That's been LeBron's thing.
*  Not only has he been healthy, he's been healthy,
*  and he has not lost a step.
*  He's not lost energy.
*  Only thing he loses is energy in games.
*  You can see there's times when he gets tired.
*  Yeah, he had like four turnovers in the second half.
*  I thought he kind of shot his way in the first half.
*  Yeah, but that's called being 40 playing NBA basketball.
*  No one else has done it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, so you had that piece,
*  then you had this Curry piece where,
*  you know, they tried to make trades all summer.
*  I know you're coaching the Bucks,
*  so it's hard for you to talk about other teams,
*  but they were pretty aggressively trying
*  to improve the team because I think they know
*  they have a window at this guy, right?
*  And some trades fell through,
*  and now they have a lot of different assets,
*  and it's clear that they're gonna wait
*  until December, January range.
*  LeBron's been in the same situation with the Lakers
*  for the last couple years,
*  where on the one hand you have these future picks
*  and a guy's older.
*  It's like how much do we sacrifice
*  for this little tiny window?
*  But on the other hand,
*  you watch basketball like we watched the last two weeks,
*  and I didn't think LeBron was one of the best
*  tempers in the league anymore.
*  Now I've had to reevaluate that
*  because you're watching all these guys together.
*  You're like, well how is he not?
*  Like these games, the more pressure that comes,
*  you said it earlier.
*  It's like I trust KD, I trust Curry, I trust LeBron.
*  It moves into this different class.
*  So if you're the Lakers now, I have to think,
*  all right, what do we do here?
*  And same thing for the Warriors, right?
*  You still have these guys that are magical.
*  I mean, all of us.
*  Listen, Bill, I've coached for 24 years.
*  I think I've coached for 24 years.
*  You don't have a lot of real opportunities to win.
*  You just don't.
*  When you have one, you have to seize the day.
*  Not only with your staff, coaching staff,
*  and with the players, but with the front office,
*  you have to because, you know, Steph has, you know,
*  I don't know, three more years, two more years, who knows?
*  LeBron, every year, each year he could retire.
*  But right now, he's still one of the best players in NBA.
*  Think about the Lakers right now.
*  It was funny, I was at a party last week in LA
*  and they were talking about the Lakers.
*  And they said, man, the Lakers, I don't know.
*  I said, I know one thing.
*  You give me the two best players,
*  two of the top 10 players in NBA.
*  You have something.
*  You always do.
*  It makes everybody else around you.
*  And kudos to Anthony Davis.
*  Like, something's happened, Bill,
*  and I'm not sure what it is,
*  but over the last year and a half, he plays more games.
*  He's playing big games.
*  He's healthy.
*  He's consistently engaged as a rebounder,
*  defensive player, which is, I think that was the nitpick.
*  It's like, can you do this?
*  Are you falling down again?
*  Like, what?
*  But it's just, it's there.
*  I see it too.
*  I mean, today, he didn't get the ball once.
*  He just got the ball when someone missed.
*  He had four of the six block shots, you know?
*  He's been fantastic.
*  And his whole attitude is-
*  He had six offensive rebounds.
*  Yeah, yeah, and that's what he does.
*  He's become that dominant Anthony Davis again.
*  So, you know, when you're a Lakers, you're looking at,
*  I have those two.
*  Now, when you look at Golden State, you have Steph Curry.
*  Yeah.
*  Draymond is one of the smartest players.
*  That's the other thing we don't give players
*  enough credit for, Bill.
*  And sometimes, I remember Kevin McHale saying it
*  when he was way old, maybe his last career.
*  And he said, the thing about my age now
*  is I see everything that I can do.
*  I just can't do anything about it.
*  But right now, you have a group of older guys
*  who they're light years ahead mentally.
*  And they can still do something about it.
*  That's what makes Steph so dangerous.
*  That's what makes Katie so dangerous.
*  And that's what makes LeBron so dominant.
*  LeBron has beaten people purely with his head.
*  He needs the athleticism,
*  but he's just beating them with his head.
*  But this is what happened with Jordan in the 96, 97, 98 range
*  because athletically, he slipped a little.
*  But mentally, and from a basketball IQ-wise,
*  he was at a whole other level.
*  I gotta say, that's one of my favorite things
*  about watching a basketball career
*  is when people hit that point
*  where you're not like Anthony Edwards right now,
*  where you can just basically physically
*  and athletically do anything you want.
*  Now you have to use a little ingenuity
*  and you have to figure out how to pace yourself
*  and steal some minutes.
*  And all the stuff LeBron's been doing,
*  that's gonna be the final piece for Curry
*  because he's not gonna be able to run around off of picks
*  for two and a half hours for eight months anymore,
*  I don't think.
*  But he can pick his spots like he did in this medal round.
*  Yeah, and that was the other thing
*  that they all were allowed to do.
*  But you're right, listen, I had my days in class,
*  but there were very few times I went into a test
*  and I knew all the answers.
*  That's how LeBron and Steph and Katie
*  are playing basketball games.
*  That's why they have the confidence.
*  They walk on the floor
*  and they literally know all the answers.
*  They know the answers to any test
*  that's gonna be thrown at them
*  and it gives them an unshakable confidence.
*  Well, I would include Durant in that too
*  because I still think the most,
*  other than that last Curry three,
*  which was the moment of the tournament,
*  when they're up two, 93-91 against Serbia,
*  40 seconds left, need a basket.
*  And they just kind of instinctively knew
*  Durant was the matchup and then B came,
*  he kind of rumbled over to come set him a pick
*  and Durant's like, it's the fuck out here,
*  I got my guy.
*  And he just did, he did the same Durant shot
*  he's doing now, but everyone on the court
*  kind of knew that was the moment and the play
*  and the shot and that he was gonna make it.
*  And that's like, you know.
*  He made another big one.
*  Right, well, in this game.
*  He made another big one tonight.
*  Yeah, he did.
*  Why the guy left to go trap Drew Halliday
*  who was inside the paint?
*  I have no idea, but I think Durant was one second
*  on the clock and Durant makes it.
*  Well, this is, I mean, this was the shame of him
*  leaving the Warriors in the first place
*  because the great thing about him is he can,
*  he's basically the most reliable 27 to 30
*  we've ever had in the history of the league,
*  but he also doesn't really need the ball
*  and can play two, three different positions
*  and guard whoever and he's like the Swiss army knife,
*  but doesn't need to be ball dominant.
*  Like can kind of play any style.
*  And that was what I loved about the 2017 Warriors,
*  that first season he had.
*  You're watching, you're like, oh my God,
*  like him and Curry, neither of them need the ball
*  that much, this is unstoppable.
*  Well, I was happy he left.
*  I can tell you that.
*  Yeah, he was like, yeah, you should go.
*  You should get out of there.
*  Yeah, if I had to run into him,
*  I definitely would have whispered that to him.
*  I think it's time.
*  You know that crazy game that was against us
*  with the Clippers when Draymond came down.
*  Oh yeah, I went to that game.
*  Yeah. Yeah, you remember that game?
*  And they started yelling at each other.
*  And they started, you know what's funny?
*  I didn't know anything about, we won that game.
*  In overtime. In overtime.
*  But, and then after the game, the media were asking me
*  about the KD green thing.
*  And I, you know, I'm going my end.
*  I don't see any of that.
*  But I can tell you all of us coaches like,
*  I hope it's real.
*  Well, in the playoffs for KD got hurt,
*  like his last kind of great stretch, you were,
*  one of the things they played was you.
*  And that was when he was like 35, 36 a game
*  and was the best here played.
*  So one of the things I love about the Olympics
*  is the hierarchy, which you remember,
*  which you mentioned earlier.
*  I have a tweet, which people feel free to make fun of
*  in April when Edwards was handing it to the Suns.
*  And I was like, well,
*  Booker's just lost his two guard spot to Edwards.
*  This is a wrap. This is done.
*  But from the get-go, it was clear the staff loved Booker.
*  And Booker was fantastic.
*  I mean, he shot over 60% from three,
*  I think for the whole tournament, pressure ball,
*  the stuff you talked about earlier.
*  The hierarchy as it evolved,
*  and we got to nut crunch time in both games,
*  seemed to be Booker, Curry, LeBron, KD, and AD.
*  But then Drew kind of right there as Swiss Army knife,
*  for what do we need?
*  I guess maybe interchangeable with either KD or Booker.
*  If it like really, if we really need,
*  like if there was an awesome guard on either of those teams,
*  I actually think Drew probably plays
*  and maybe they go three guards.
*  So they did some three guards,
*  but it turned out those were the six guys.
*  Do any of those names surprise you?
*  Booker, Curry, LeBron, KD, AD,
*  and then Drew kind of right there.
*  Were you surprised that became the six?
*  A little bit.
*  I think that was, if you look at the team,
*  they'd make sense that that would be the six.
*  You could have made a case that you thought Joel
*  would be one of the six.
*  And you can make a case that either Anthony Edwards
*  or Tatum possibly would be one of the six.
*  But when you look at how they play,
*  you can understand that yeah, that was the clear six.
*  You can tell exactly, I always loved these like,
*  like all-star game format, all these players,
*  but then when it gets serious,
*  the coach will tell you exactly what he thinks.
*  Right.
*  And who he thinks he can win with.
*  And Steve Kerr, you know,
*  all these other games he would mix and match,
*  but those metal games,
*  you knew exactly who he trusted the most.
*  And he did not waver from it.
*  Yeah, like LeBron played 32,
*  but I think he was over 30 minutes in both games.
*  Usually, and I was talking about this
*  before the tournament started.
*  Like these, cause the real question with this team was,
*  who's gonna lose minutes?
*  This is probably the most talented
*  one through 12 team they've had.
*  Even if you go back to 92,
*  he had Leitner who you knew wasn't gonna play.
*  Bird had the back brace.
*  You know, Stockton was hurt during the tournament
*  so that the decisions were a little easier.
*  This was tougher.
*  So they push out Halliburton early.
*  Derek White's playing so well,
*  Steve Kerr can't even keep him off the floor
*  and Tatum can't make a shot.
*  And then all of a sudden the hierarchy starts coming.
*  There was still a weird three center thing.
*  Like he played three centers in both halves of this game.
*  Started with Embiid, played a lot of Davis,
*  and then brought Bam in for big stretches
*  in the second and fourth quarter.
*  But ultimately it was AD who was the center.
*  And that's how it worked out.
*  Bam played, yeah, I thought it was pretty smart.
*  I mean, he wanted all three to play.
*  It would be interesting if he didn't care about Eagles
*  or didn't have to worry about that,
*  who he would have played.
*  That would have been an interesting exercise.
*  You know, they played Joel tonight and the last game.
*  First, what, six minutes of the first quarter,
*  first six minutes of the third quarter,
*  and then that was it.
*  Bam was good though in his minutes.
*  Like he knows his role.
*  But Bam's always been,
*  like he's always played a star that plays in his role.
*  You know, he kind of got that.
*  That's why it was so easy for Drew as well.
*  Like he's a role player, but he's a star at it.
*  So I thought it was easy.
*  I thought the guys, again, who impressed me,
*  I thought Steph struggled with it for a while
*  because he wasn't getting a lot of arithmetic shots.
*  And then by the medal rounds, he kind of figured it out.
*  I thought KD, it's a perfect role for him.
*  But I thought the bigs overall, like Joel, that was tough.
*  Like he's used to being the focal point,
*  them going to him.
*  And you know, he got loose a little bit in the Serbia game.
*  Other than that, he was out of rhythm a lot
*  because he's not used to just being a rebounder
*  in the pick center.
*  Right.
*  That Durant shot you were talking about.
*  The funniest thing is you can hear someone
*  from their bench yelling,
*  because Joel was trying to set a pick
*  and they were yelling, get out of the way.
*  Right, go.
*  Yeah, I was sitting there laughing.
*  I said, I don't think Joel and B
*  has ever heard that in his life.
*  Somebody telling him to get out of the way.
*  But they all handled it.
*  I mean, Joel handled it.
*  I think they all handled it very well.
*  He really struggled in the first quarter
*  when they played him.
*  And he had some really valuable minutes in the Serbia game,
*  especially in the fourth quarter.
*  He scored three straight hoops.
*  I went back and watched it after we did the podcast
*  right after the game.
*  And the problem with him is the defensive rebounds
*  that he's just, you give up offensive rebounds
*  when he's out there.
*  Like he's late to come out on shooters.
*  And I think there's some stuff that,
*  you know, you kind of throw him out there
*  and see what he has.
*  And if he doesn't totally have it,
*  now you're moving to Davis and Bam.
*  It's nice to have options.
*  In the NBA, it doesn't work like that.
*  You're not like, oh, I'll bring in Anthony Davis now.
*  Oh, now I'm bringing Bam out of bio.
*  Oh, that'll be fun.
*  I remember I was coaching a USA team.
*  It was Flip Saunders was the head coach
*  and me and Tom Izzo were the assistant coaches.
*  And we're gonna win the goal,
*  but Brazil was, they were playing unbelievable.
*  This was Ney-Ney Barbolso.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Viraj, but we had never heard of them.
*  They were that young and they were killing us.
*  I mean, they were having the game of their lives
*  and they're having the fourth quarter Izzo guy.
*  He's like, he grabs my shirt.
*  We have to do something, we're gonna lose.
*  I remember telling Flip, I said,
*  Flip, we don't need any trick plays.
*  We're better.
*  Let's just run a normal play,
*  move the ball and get the right shot.
*  And Baron Davis, if you ever go back,
*  Baron Davis just took the game over
*  when we started doing that because he was better.
*  We didn't need to throw a lot.
*  We just needed him to play.
*  But boy, I tell you, all those guys,
*  the way they played, it was just,
*  Curt didn't get enough credit
*  because he had a lot of talent
*  and that's part of it with coaching.
*  But I thought for the most part,
*  everyone bought into their roles.
*  So the pressure of when you're in that FIBA situation,
*  you have a better team,
*  but now you're in a sports movie
*  and the other team is the underdog in the sports movie
*  and they're hitting shots.
*  Like Serbia two days ago was the best example of this.
*  They come out, they're hitting everything.
*  And it was like, they have yolkage.
*  They're like a high school team built around one guy
*  and some shooters trying to beat the best team in the state.
*  The pressure of that, especially with the no,
*  you have no momentum at all in FIBA.
*  It's just chaotic.
*  There's like no way to stop timeouts.
*  And it's just like, you just feel like you're on a skateboard
*  going down a hill versus like, I don't know,
*  games you've coached, like let's go 2008,
*  game seven against Cleveland.
*  Like one of those type of games
*  where you're in a little more control on it.
*  Like what's different about the pressure
*  between those two situations?
*  It's a different pressure.
*  There's a different pressure when you're supposed to win.
*  So when you're the USA team,
*  everyone knows you have the most talent.
*  There's no doubt about that.
*  When you're trying to win an NBA title,
*  there's a different pressure
*  because you want to win the title.
*  But you're not necessarily the best team.
*  I would say when we beat the Lakers in 2008,
*  most people picked the Lakers.
*  They were minus 190 favorites.
*  You guys were underdogs.
*  Yeah, they were the favorites.
*  Yeah, we were the underdogs,
*  which still myths us when we, you know,
*  we always talk about we were not ever
*  the underdogs in our mind,
*  but it is a different type of pressure.
*  You know, it's funny, Paul Pierce, I remember this,
*  and this was not in 2008, 2009, the year after we won.
*  And we got out to that amazing start.
*  I remember, I bet there were seven games, Bill,
*  that we absolutely should have lost.
*  But at the very end of the game, we just won the game.
*  That's what Serbia was the other night.
*  Like I saw it, you see it coming.
*  They look up and they're winning,
*  and they see that score,
*  and they're looking at that clock.
*  They're not playing the same anymore.
*  I saw that over and over.
*  Teams wanted to beat you so bad
*  that they actually got in their own way half the time.
*  And I thought that happened the other night.
*  Yeah, they were 0 for 10 in the fourth quarter.
*  I mean, this game today was great,
*  and we're gonna remember it for the Curry Threes,
*  I think will be the legacy of it.
*  That Serbia game,
*  Kerr said it was the best basketball game
*  he's probably ever been involved with.
*  It sounded like he needed to think about it more.
*  It really did seem like one of the great basketball games.
*  And we've had some fun ones in the Olympics.
*  08, you mentioned, with Kobe against Spain in 2012.
*  But I think that Serbia game might have been the peak.
*  When you think about having the top.
*  That's the best Olympic game I've ever seen.
*  Oh yeah, three of the 15 best players ever,
*  and then you have Schubert,
*  Schubert's got a little bit of a scourge on the other side,
*  and just the right guys getting hot for his team
*  to keep them around.
*  And the drama was nuts.
*  I think it's the best Olympic game ever played,
*  as far as talent, skill, and well played.
*  It's hard for me to think of another game.
*  And I've been watching the Olympics,
*  my uncle Jim Brewer played on that Travis C72
*  with the Munich, that was my uncle in that game.
*  Oh God.
*  Jim Brewer?
*  Yeah, Jim Brewer.
*  Oh, I didn't realize he was your uncle, wow.
*  Yeah, yeah, that was a wrong game to watch.
*  Well they won, they got stolen.
*  They won the gold medal and then it got stolen away.
*  They won twice.
*  They won twice.
*  I still think it's awesome that all those silver medals
*  are still sitting in the vault and that one player,
*  you know they called them every year.
*  Every year they called, and you would assume
*  like at some point someone would say yeah for their kids,
*  all knows, it's pretty cool.
*  Yeah, because it was an absolute thievery.
*  One other thing that stood out, 10 years ago,
*  the USA won because we were the better athletes.
*  Now we're winning because of shooting.
*  Our shooting was the difference in this game.
*  It's amazing how it's flipped.
*  We're the skill players now.
*  You know, we're the team.
*  Our three point shooting won against Serbia
*  and the difference of the game that they was just shooting.
*  Nine for 30 from France and 18 for 36 from USA.
*  But that goes to why they built.
*  And that's like all my Boston friends who,
*  it's gonna be, I'll just say this,
*  it's gonna be tough for Kerr when he comes
*  for the Warriors Celtics game in Boston.
*  Oh no, no doubt.
*  You know what's gonna happen.
*  He's gonna get the A-Rod treatment.
*  But Tatum just wasn't hitting outside shots.
*  He missed another one today.
*  I think they were really adamant about if you're out there,
*  you gotta be able to shoot and make open shots.
*  Or make plays.
*  And it was so funny, Bill, today I'm golfing
*  and one of the guys is from Boston, Robbie.
*  And the first thing he said, what's up with Kerr, man?
*  I said, Robbie, what do you mean?
*  He said, what's up with him?
*  Is he jealous?
*  I mean, he was just, he had all these reasons
*  why Tatum wasn't playing.
*  And he really believed that they kept Jalen Brown off.
*  They're trying to mess the team up.
*  And I said, I don't think any of that is true,
*  but we'll see.
*  Well, welcome to about 12 of my text threads.
*  It's like Steve Kerr, he's trying to end
*  the Celtics dynasty before it begins.
*  What does he have against Tatum?
*  Even my dad, who's a pretty bellow dude,
*  even my dad is completely outraged.
*  He was like, Tatum, we just won the title.
*  Tatum did everything.
*  I mean, you think like with the rebounding and the defense,
*  and he got out there today, got some minutes,
*  and I think all the Celtics fans were like,
*  please, please have this go well, please, please, please.
*  But the bottom line is LeBron and KD are on the team,
*  and those guys are gonna play big minutes, and that's it.
*  And every player on the Olympic team
*  is used to being the best player on their team.
*  And now you go to an Olympic team,
*  and you're the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh best player,
*  that's different touches, that's playing differently.
*  That's hard.
*  It is hard.
*  You see it, you see it all the time.
*  Like, Coach K used to tell me the first couple of practices
*  of the college season, all the freshmen come in,
*  and they've been the best player on their team.
*  And now they're on the college team.
*  And then those college guys, you think about it,
*  there's gonna be tons of college guys
*  that make it into the NBA this year,
*  and there's gonna be a coach on every side,
*  hey, your job is to rebound and pass.
*  That guy was scoring 35 last year.
*  And so all that is, it's hard.
*  It is really hard.
*  Yeah, go stand in the corner.
*  Go stand in the corner.
*  It's like, my usage rate was 30 on my own team.
*  Yeah, what's the deal?
*  And so it is different.
*  Let's talk your personal experience with Steph and LeBron.
*  Because you, we'll start with Steph.
*  I mean, Steph's basically in your family.
*  Yeah, he is.
*  He is in my family, yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't know what the, he's in law law,
*  I don't know what it is.
*  But your daughter married Seth, who's Steph's brother.
*  So somehow you're in the extended family,
*  but you've coached against him forever,
*  and then I'm sure you've gotten to know him.
*  But what do we not know about Steph
*  that you get to see behind closed doors?
*  I think you know it, you just don't see it.
*  Is, first of all, he's so high character.
*  And Bill, I can't undersell how high his character is.
*  I've seen him do things with his brothers and sisters
*  that just no one does.
*  The second part of him is he is competitive,
*  and deadly competitive.
*  I always joke with him.
*  You get this schoolboy choir routine, everybody loves you,
*  you're this nice guy, and at the same time,
*  you're trying to cut a heart out every time.
*  He's a killer.
*  Very, very competitive towards teams, towards individuals.
*  Are we talking family monopoly?
*  He's the banker and he's stealing money from the bank?
*  Yes, go off.
*  It's just, that's who he is.
*  It comes out, and it comes out in a great way.
*  I love seeing it because you assume it
*  because he's so good and he wins, but it's there.
*  And the challenges, even today,
*  he's making shots, he's pointing to the crowd,
*  that's not an act, that's real.
*  That's pretty cool to watch.
*  Well, you can't be, there's a certain level
*  you can't get to unless you're just wired
*  like that all the time.
*  There's that famous, the famous Jordan stories
*  about him betting people whose bags were gonna come out first
*  but he had already paid the baggage handler
*  to get his bag out first.
*  That's just, I don't know how you shut that up.
*  So you must've played golf with Steph a couple times,
*  I'm guessing.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He's a little better than me to say the least.
*  Yeah, I was gonna say, he's like a prodigy.
*  He's pretty good.
*  Proc-a-chip.
*  He's really good, but his father is right with him.
*  As Steph said, the difference is his father plays
*  for 12 months a year.
*  Steph says, I can't do that yet.
*  So when he retires, he'll be really good.
*  All right, and then LeBron, who you're going against
*  with your team and you guys are trying to break him.
*  Yeah, he actually leaves Cleveland.
*  It was a semi-break and goes to Miami.
*  And then he had that chance in 2012 to really like,
*  I think break that Miami team up if he win one more game.
*  Instead, he puts a bunch of chest hair on,
*  his whole career changes.
*  And then you see from that moment to now,
*  what's different?
*  I thought that was the biggest game of his career.
*  Game six.
*  I thought it was the biggest game.
*  I'm sure he'll say other games,
*  but we had them on our ropes with an aging team.
*  We were not that talented.
*  Other than, we still had our big three
*  and Rondo was still pretty good.
*  I think Rondo was injured in that series.
*  And that game in Boston is really, if you remember,
*  he made threes.
*  He was shooting the ball.
*  Yeah, it was all jump shots and just surgical 24 hours.
*  Something he had never done.
*  But to me, what the biggest part,
*  there's a lot of things with LeBron that I love saying.
*  How he could overachieve with the fanfare
*  that he had coming in is absolutely amazing.
*  I mean, he was only set up to fail.
*  When you think about it,
*  he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated,
*  the second coming of God,
*  and he overachieved.
*  It's a pretty amazing thing.
*  The other two things is watching his growth.
*  In Cleveland, he was a special player,
*  but I didn't think he was a special student yet.
*  As far as, he had this high IQ,
*  but he hadn't added in the film work
*  that you need to know the other team's stuff
*  and their cause.
*  And then I remember the first game against Miami.
*  He was yelling all our sets out to the other guys.
*  And I don't think it was Timono, it might have been.
*  Whoever my assistant was, and I said it,
*  I turned around and said, oh boy.
*  You were like, oh no, oh God.
*  Yeah, because that's what KG did.
*  Every game, Kevin, Rhonda, they both, they knew whatever.
*  They knew that if one of the guys
*  on the other team went the wrong way,
*  they was, no, you need to go this way.
*  You're messing the play up.
*  And that was LeBron.
*  And to now, and you can ask coaches around the league,
*  end of a game, you don't want LeBron near the play
*  because he knows your play.
*  Yeah, he's got a guess, right?
*  He does the film work, he does the studying.
*  And that was the last step for him in watching that growth.
*  Then the last thing,
*  and I don't think this is talked about a lot,
*  how many people do we know
*  that brought his best friends with him
*  and made careers for them?
*  Maverick and Rich Paul, what he's done,
*  and now they're doing it on their own,
*  but that has never been done in sports, ever.
*  And to me, the off the court stuff like that,
*  he didn't just give his friends money.
*  He made his friends become businessmen.
*  And they took a lot of shit for that initially, remember?
*  They was like, why doesn't he have his typical,
*  I remember in the late 2000s,
*  people were like, what's going on with this?
*  Rich Paul worked in the mailroom with CAA,
*  because LeBron made him start from the scratch.
*  And now he's worth whatever
*  and is about to marry Adele.
*  Life is good.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  When you've got to spend what,
*  nine, 10 months with Giannis at this point,
*  what reminds you about him of what you saw with LeBron?
*  Because Giannis is at this point now,
*  he's at the apex of where his career is gonna be, right?
*  He's 31 and 11 every night,
*  but physically he's the best and the most athletic
*  he's probably ever gonna be,
*  but now the mental piece has to be the next step, right?
*  Yeah, the mental piece is growing,
*  and then the skill piece still.
*  When you think about where he can still go,
*  improve his shot from the elbow, improve his free throws,
*  improve seeing everything,
*  that's what to me this year, watching him play,
*  where I thought his growth was just how he can process
*  where everybody's coming from.
*  Early in his career, you thought you could trap him more,
*  force turnovers, he would still put his head down
*  and just try to will himself.
*  And this year you can see the game really slowing down
*  for him and doing some really good stuff.
*  So that's where his growth still,
*  I mean, the other thing you love about him,
*  no one's gonna outwork him.
*  His conditioning level, Bill, is scary good,
*  to slow him down good, especially in the summer times.
*  I was happy they made it to the Olympics,
*  but then I was like, okay, now let's go home
*  so we can get back to work.
*  Well, I texted you, because you went,
*  I thought, what did you go,
*  so you could have a heart attack
*  every time he drove into Three Guys?
*  You must have been watching your kids
*  play in the playground or something.
*  Oh my gosh, there was one fall in the first game
*  and he went down hard and me and John Horace,
*  we were sitting there like, this cannot happen.
*  He pops up, but after that fall, Bill,
*  I swear I was thinking, come on, two more losses.
*  Right, you're brooding against Greece.
*  Yeah, we can get out of here,
*  because you wanted him to do well,
*  but you just wanted him to stay healthy.
*  Think about the last two years,
*  he has not played in the playoffs.
*  And that's really important for him.
*  Well, and that's what you talked about earlier with LeBron.
*  The durability, it's him and Kareem.
*  I mean, Kareem's worst injury
*  was when he punched Kent Benson, right?
*  He broke his hand.
*  That was the self-inflicted worst injury ever,
*  but LeBron, same thing,
*  some guys are just built to do this
*  and they put the time in off the court and that's it.
*  That was the other thing.
*  He's like Tiger Woodish.
*  How Tiger changed golf with working out.
*  LeBron has changed basketball.
*  People are doing the work more
*  because of his conditioning level.
*  But there was a game, I want to say it was us against him,
*  and he sprained his ankle.
*  His ankle hit the floor, it turned over,
*  and it was right in front of me.
*  And I'm thinking, he's hurt.
*  He walks over, ties his shoes,
*  and I think two plays later, he gets an alley-oop dunk.
*  And I'm like, this guy is different
*  because that should have hurt.
*  So he might be the true Iliad.
*  It might not be Wemba Nyama.
*  It might actually be LeBron.
*  Exactly.
*  We didn't talk about Wemba Nyama.
*  Yeah, it's boring.
*  We didn't really talk about France at all
*  who didn't have a point guard.
*  Yabba Selle.
*  Wasn't he a Celtic?
*  Danny Ainsdraff pick number 16, 2016.
*  Danny gets another win.
*  But he was good.
*  I thought Wemba, you know, that was unbelievable.
*  At least he missed a couple threes, whatever,
*  but he also made a couple,
*  but there was a fearlessness to him.
*  And when you're going against a team like that,
*  and he just kept coming and coming and coming.
*  I was so impressed.
*  I loved it.
*  You know what I was impressed with after the game?
*  He was crying.
*  What that told me, Bill, in his mind,
*  he thought they were gonna win.
*  No one watching that game thought France was gonna win.
*  But their player did.
*  And it just shows to me, like, he's competitive.
*  And you can feel that.
*  He wanted to win that game,
*  and he believed they could win that game.
*  I tell you, for that, for him to have that this young,
*  this league better watch out.
*  He is coming, Bill, and he's coming fast.
*  But how fast?
*  How fast do we think?
*  Is he a second-team All-I-MBA guy?
*  Like, what is his ceiling just for next season?
*  I think he probably is, right?
*  Numbers-wise, you could have made a strong case
*  for him to be on the All-I-MBA team this year.
*  Yeah, the team was so bad, it's hard.
*  I have a vote.
*  I never, if somebody's on a really bad team,
*  I just, they're a cross-off for me.
*  Yeah, for me, the All-Star voting is like that.
*  Very difficult to, if your team is 10 games under 500,
*  how can you be an All-Star?
*  But then you think sometimes, his team is terrible.
*  It's not his fault.
*  So you gotta do a little bit of both.
*  But there's other times somebody's put up numbers
*  because they're on a terrible team
*  and somebody's gotta put up numbers.
*  We've seen, I don't wanna name guys,
*  but we know there's been some dudes over the years
*  that's like, that guy's averaging 30?
*  But yeah, his team's 25 and 57.
*  Exactly, and sometimes they're averaging 30,
*  and that's why his team is 25 and 37.
*  So when you're looking, you look at all that stuff.
*  How do you, when you're watching these FIBA games
*  and there's guys doing well, like the guys on France,
*  like LeSore and Courtenay, and especially Yabba Selle,
*  but it's a different kind of style,
*  and some guys just make more sense in FIBA.
*  But I said this two days ago on the pod,
*  so I'm not, this is recency bias
*  because Yabba Selle was great today.
*  I genuinely feel like he's an NBA rotation guy.
*  And he's in shape now, he can hit threes.
*  He was guarding LeBron, did you see that part?
*  I was so impressed with him.
*  I thought defensively he could switch on anyone,
*  guard him, kept him in front.
*  He's a big body, where he's really changed his game.
*  He was never a shooter,
*  and now he's shooting the heck out of the ball.
*  And he's a boost down low.
*  Well, he's in way better shape, but kept his strength.
*  Because when he was at Celtics, he was just overweight.
*  But now he had enough strength,
*  like LeBron really tried to put his shoulder on him
*  a couple times, and he didn't move.
*  And he's also grown up, he has a toughness level about him.
*  So yeah, he could be a rotation player for sure in NBA now.
*  He was the one guy that jumped out.
*  It's hard to tell with some of these dudes.
*  You watch somebody like LeSore, and it's like,
*  all right, when we get,
*  we've seen the Kenneth Fareed types,
*  and yeah, they can get minutes,
*  but you had Harrow, who was probably
*  one of the best versions of that.
*  How many rounds am I going in the playoffs
*  if I'm playing 25 minutes with somebody?
*  That's where it gets tough.
*  But Yav Selle, I think, is a rotation guy.
*  There's no question.
*  No, the way he shoots, and what I was impressed with also
*  is his ability to just kind of fit in.
*  He didn't force many shots, he let it come to him.
*  Really impressed with him.
*  Jokic, we just gotta mention quickly.
*  Because I was arguing with your friend Eddie Johnson
*  about Jokic, because he was like, oh, Embiid,
*  Eddie's an Embiid guy.
*  He was like, your guy Jokic, he couldn't come through.
*  And I'm like, Eddie, nobody's ever gone through a gauntlet
*  like that and kept their team in the game.
*  He had one of the best 13 players in the game.
*  He's going against Embiid and Bam and AD.
*  LeBron's guarding him in the fourth quarter
*  so the center can roam.
*  I thought that was insane.
*  What'd you think of Jokic in that game?
*  I thought he was amazing.
*  The first half, he controlled the whole game.
*  Yeah, and they're double teaming him.
*  Yeah, double teaming him.
*  LeBron double once, which was not a very smart double team
*  from the baseline late in the game.
*  Yeah, found the game.
*  He makes you pay.
*  He's like Barrett Bodds.
*  If you throw the wrong ball,
*  he's hitting it out of the ballpark.
*  That's before and after steroids with Barrett Bodds.
*  That's how he's always been.
*  LeBron, if you ever watch it again,
*  he tried to sneak behind him to trap,
*  but he left the guy under the basket.
*  He got half bam.
*  It was just his brain and his way of play is so dominant.
*  He literally put that team on his back,
*  got them shots, and they almost beat an amazing USA team.
*  Yeah, that game by itself.
*  He's so good.
*  That was by itself a documentary.
*  I do my curiosity.
*  Listen, I pushed Joel to play for USA.
*  I was part of that when I was there.
*  But man, I was watching the game tonight
*  just for fan's sake.
*  And I was thinking, oh man, this would have been
*  an interesting game if Joel, Wimby were on the same team.
*  Right.
*  Like how would the US,
*  because they would have bam and Davis,
*  but really those would have been the biggest guys
*  other than Durant.
*  Yeah, I was thinking who else would they have,
*  what would be the other big
*  that they would have gotten the USA team.
*  Honestly, it might have been Chet.
*  It could have been.
*  It could have been.
*  But it's funny, I'm looking at it and like, wow,
*  that would have been, this game would have been interesting.
*  If it was an in shape and bead with Wimby
*  and then Go Bear as the backup big.
*  As the backup?
*  Not nothing.
*  My gosh, it would have been interesting.
*  France to me felt like they were one,
*  we said earlier, it's just that one kind of crafty
*  guard short, even though they got a pretty good game
*  from Ticolo.
*  I gotta ask about your bucks really fast.
*  You weren't on the Christmas schedule.
*  You mean us, and thank God, I'm so happy about that.
*  Well, I know you were happy
*  because now you get Christmas with your family.
*  Yeah, no, it's just.
*  So, Giannis, multiple MVP, one of the faces of the league
*  and usually that Christmas schedule is all the faces.
*  Now, granted, they have the most talent they've had
*  in 30 years and you wanna get Wimby in there
*  and all this stuff, but I kinda did a double take
*  when I saw Giannis in one of the five games.
*  This is one of the guys.
*  Is there a case building here for the everyone
*  is sleeping on the bucks or am I nuts?
*  Or are you not allowed to talk about this
*  because you're just gonna put it on the whiteboard?
*  I'm gonna put it on the whiteboard for sure, Bill.
*  No Christmas.
*  We weren't good enough for Christmas.
*  Put that on the whiteboard.
*  Yeah, I'm gonna tease him about it for sure.
*  Listen, when I first saw it, I was shocked.
*  I was surprised.
*  Was it angry?
*  No.
*  We've lost two years in a row in the first round.
*  Some of this, you have to earn it.
*  We've lost that.
*  So now we have to get it back.
*  I think it'll be a wake up call for everybody.
*  At the end of the day, we wanna be playing
*  at the end of the year anyway, not on Christmas Day.
*  This is the most coach-like you've sounded.
*  Yeah, this is the most.
*  You're in coach mode, I like it.
*  Well, I'll say, I'll build the case for Giannis
*  for this season.
*  Jokic, it's been a love fest.
*  He's won three MVPs.
*  LeBron, Curry, KD, that generation
*  getting all the flowers right now.
*  Tatum just won a title and Bied won the MVP two years ago.
*  You got Shade, Gilded, Alexander,
*  they're the favorites in the West, OKC.
*  All these teams, you go down the line,
*  and we saw a lot of them in the Olympics.
*  Lucas sitting there, he just carried his team to the finals.
*  And Giannis, it's like, this is funny how the league works
*  where you have all these stars and sometimes guys get,
*  and then they notice and all of a sudden
*  you put the big chip.
*  So I think this is good for you.
*  Big chip on the shoulders season for Giannis coming.
*  For our whole team, Bill,
*  I know we were injured and all that, but we still lost.
*  And teams don't like, good teams don't like to lose.
*  They don't like to lose in the first round.
*  We've had an impressive summer.
*  When you think about the money we had, we had none.
*  We had minimal contracts, you know,
*  and to get the three right and Prince and Trent.
*  The Trent thing as a Celtic fan made me mad.
*  I was like, come on.
*  Yeah.
*  Because all three of those guys you got
*  can play in the game we just watched.
*  They could play minutes and that,
*  cause they wouldn't be scared.
*  You got three of them.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. So it was a great summer that way.
*  The work has been good.
*  So yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
*  I can't wait.
*  It's rare, Bill, there's a lot of years, 2008, 10,
*  you have teams you can't wait to get to work with.
*  And I think this is one of them for me, for sure.
*  Is this the most talented the league's ever been
*  since you've been involved in the league?
*  It's gotta be right up there.
*  It's getting deep again.
*  I would say in the mid to late eighties.
*  I was gonna say, yeah, that 90 to 93 range.
*  Yeah. Everybody was deep.
*  And Bill, you forget, like when I started,
*  there was 23 teams, right?
*  Right.
*  So if you take seven teams away from the NBA right now
*  and spread all the, the one thing I would say
*  in my first six years, I always thought the benches
*  on the other teams were amazing.
*  Like the benches would come in and run you out of the gym
*  and you don't see that anymore.
*  Especially with the salary structures and all that.
*  But the teams with the great benches now,
*  it will do them favors later.
*  So that'll be interesting thing to watch
*  through the season, through everybody.
*  Yeah, that was a big advantage for the Celtics last year
*  because their bench could actually extend leads.
*  I think that's gonna be OKC, one of the best cases for them.
*  Yes.
*  As you look at just the youth and the durability
*  and the ability to move people around and.
*  And the stockpile of picks, the Clippers game.
*  That too.
*  Yeah.
*  How are we feeling about the Clippers
*  opening the new arena?
*  It's gonna be interesting.
*  Have you been to the arena?
*  I have not been, but.
*  You have to go.
*  It's James Harden and Kawhi Leonard
*  who just was told to leave the Olympic team.
*  So I don't know how I'm feeling.
*  Yeah, I think they're gonna be pretty good still.
*  I love like the, you know, the platoon pickups and all that.
*  And, you know, the big three era may be kind of lost now.
*  It's really the best two and then everybody that fits around them.
*  And so, you know, they had turmoil with those three guys.
*  You know, Paul wanted the ball more.
*  James, James is running the show.
*  And to me, James should run the show.
*  That's what he does.
*  And that affected.
*  And, you know, Paul goes through to Philadelphia.
*  So but the league right now, you think about the East,
*  I mean, Philly had a great, a lot of great pickups.
*  You know, we're going to be healthy.
*  We've had some pickups.
*  Well, the Nicks, the Celtics, the Celtics, and it's
*  the best next team we've had in 30 years.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So, yeah, it's going to be pretty interesting.
*  Pretty interesting.
*  Orlando kind of hanging around waiting for.
*  And listen, they had some great pickups.
*  Picking up Pope was huge for them.
*  Right.
*  You know, a veteran guard.
*  That's what they needed.
*  Miami is Miami.
*  You know, all the guys are back.
*  Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland kept all their dudes.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's going to be a hard East this year.
*  It's going to be deep.
*  And you're going to have to earn wins.
*  We talk about Indiana, who made it to the East.
*  We should have mentioned them.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's just going to be a tough one.
*  And that's good.
*  All right.
*  Before we wrap your three favorite things about the Olympics
*  2024 basketball edition, what's number one?
*  Curry today.
*  Three favorite are Curry.
*  Curry today or just Curry in general?
*  Curry the last two games.
*  But Curry today was special.
*  I don't know if he was more special in the qualifier
*  the game before that.
*  But either way, those two games to me
*  were my favorite moments of the Olympics
*  as far as the basketball part to watch.
*  My second one would be Wimby, like the way he can play.
*  He played today.
*  How emotional he was for a guy that loved basketball
*  and coaches that's that just says a lot about you.
*  And that was pretty cool for us.
*  Then non basketball, the track and field, man, the women.
*  It was it was it was amazing watching, you know,
*  you think about track and field.
*  They have they play once every four years.
*  You know, they have the World Championships and all that.
*  But it's the Olympics.
*  Yeah. And just watching them all.
*  I just watching them all was so amazing to me.
*  So I think Paris is the best Olympics that I've seen maybe ever.
*  It just everything stands out.
*  It's been beautiful.
*  I was there, unfortunately, the first night.
*  Oh, God. Opening ceremonies.
*  And whoever thought of that, it was a great idea.
*  But being there, it actually was not.
*  You didn't see anything. You saw the boats go by on TV.
*  I'm sure it looked great. Yeah.
*  But thank God, you know, the best break I've ever had was Greece
*  was the first country because they're always the first country.
*  And we got to see Yannis with the flag.
*  He went by. We were in the big USA box with Grant Hill and everybody.
*  And when Yannis went by and looked at Grant and everybody said, guys,
*  the USA is not going to be here for another two hours and 45 minutes.
*  I'm out. It's pouring rain. I'm out.
*  So I thought that part on TV.
*  I thought the Olympics was incredible.
*  I wasn't prepared for how much I was going to watch, how into it I was.
*  And the hoops was like the cherry on the sundae,
*  because that's by far the best hoops tournament they've had.
*  You think back to the Oscar Schmidt era and how, you know, every every team
*  had like one dis. Now it's like these teams are actually good.
*  But I thought the ability to go back if you miss something
*  and to go on Peacock and just be like, oh, I'm going to watch that 100 yard dash.
*  I missed it. You just queued up. That was amazing.
*  I've been a number one hater of Peacock until the Olympics.
*  Right. Everyone's back.
*  Or any of these auxiliary channels.
*  I hate them. But Peacock was amazing.
*  Like they did their job. It was so great.
*  Even you can watch you have the list like you can watch this, this or this.
*  Or you can go back and watch games, which most of the games I watch
*  was me going back to watch. Right.
*  So well, that's what we had in the West Coast.
*  Some of the games were coming on at five in the morning.
*  So you could just set it up and on cue.
*  It's fine. It felt like the Olympics 12 years ago, eight years ago,
*  was heading toward this place where it was going to become a relic.
*  It was like, oh, man, because I remember watching everything in 1976 and 84.
*  And I was like, oh, I remember that.
*  And it was just that era was going to end.
*  And instead, it came back, which I love.
*  Japan should get another Olympics because they
*  I think that would have been amazing, but no one was there.
*  And so they should get another shot at it.
*  But well, LA is going to be LA is going to be out of control in the hoops.
*  That'll be the hardest ticket of all of them.
*  All right. Doc Rivers, enjoy the summer.
*  You beating Larry and golf or no?
*  What's what's this? What are the standings?
*  Yeah, that's always that. That's always.
*  Yeah, yeah. Larry is.
*  He is my bank for the summer, for sure.
*  You say it. I thought if he was retired,
*  I thought that was going to help his golf game, but apparently not.
*  No, no. More golf does not help, Larry.
*  All right. Thanks for jumping out. Good to see you.
*  All right. Take care.
