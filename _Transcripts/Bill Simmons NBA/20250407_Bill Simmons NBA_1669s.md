# Duke’s Unfathomable Collapse in the Final Four | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4)
*  An unbelievable unfathomable Duke collapse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=0.0s)]
*  Rossello one of the all timers, something that brought me back to where we were [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=2.94s)]
*  in college sports and like the eighties when shit like that seemed to happen way [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=8.42s)]
*  more often, um, just watching. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=11.64s)]
*  When did you start wondering, Oh my God, are they going to blow this? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=14.4s)]
*  Cause for me, it was when, uh, when they got the steel, it was the 77 76 was the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=18.6s)]
*  first time I was like, Oh my God, they might actually lose this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=22.76s)]
*  I still can't believe they lost it the next day that I'm sitting here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=26.36s)]
*  Uh, I know you and I both bet it and I don't bet a ton of games, but when I saw [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=29.96s)]
*  the line come out and I had watched, you know, look, I'm certainly far from an [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=33.36s)]
*  expert on college basketball, but I just thought based on the size advantage that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=37.1s)]
*  Duke had and three lottery picks, you know, like, okay, four isn't, isn't that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=42.8s)]
*  bad of a number in the whole game. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=46.68s)]
*  I'm like, you should have bet more. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  You should have been more like you were so right about this, you know, and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=49.56s)]
*  it anybody that, you know, gambles enough, you just have games where you go, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=52.04s)]
*  wow, I saw this the worst possible way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=55.32s)]
*  And immediately, you know, you're fucked. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=58.36s)]
*  And on this one, I sat there the whole time being like, I'm so smart. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=60.12s)]
*  I'm so smart. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=63.04s)]
*  I would say there was two moments that hinted at what was going to happen. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=63.72s)]
*  That barrage of threes at the end of the first half kept Houston in it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  So they feel good despite being outplayed the first 20 minutes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=71.2s)]
*  They went to halftime feeling good about themselves. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=74.6s)]
*  Not that this team necessarily needed the confidence boost, but being the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=76.68s)]
*  dogs, but they're a super aggressive team with, with a lot of confidence. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=79.12s)]
*  And then really, I think crier and those guys, like the two guards just hitting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=83.0s)]
*  threes, they get like, how is this game? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  Not 20. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  How is it not 25 points? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=92.0s)]
*  And then I think once you saw that sign, James just could not, he was not [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  comfortable inbounding the ball. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  And they kept going to this, the same flashing thing to the corner where they [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  were running the inbounds catch to the corner. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=103.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=105.96s)]
*  Which you're taught in like seventh grade not to do that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=109.72s)]
*  Don't get trapped in the corner is the number one thing for the inbounds pass. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=109.92s)]
*  The number two is just don't throw it up for grabs under your own basket. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=113.2s)]
*  And they somehow did both. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=116.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  I guess I was shocked and some people even said like after James hit his head, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=118.48s)]
*  that's, but it was very clear. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=122.84s)]
*  He was freaking out trying to inbounds it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=125.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=128.6s)]
*  And Shire was just fine with it, I guess. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=129.04s)]
*  And then, you know, then it actually happens and then you have the foul on Cooper. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=133.4s)]
*  But look, this team was up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=138.32s)]
*  They gave up on nine Oh run with 35 seconds. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=140.28s)]
*  They didn't hit a field goal for like the last. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=142.64s)]
*  What? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=145.04s)]
*  10, you know, so they had a drought that felt like a half hour with all the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=145.6s)]
*  challenges and all the reviews and all the other things. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=149.96s)]
*  And they, first of all, there was a play in this game. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=152.68s)]
*  I'll be interested to see if you've seen it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=155.96s)]
*  Cause I can't remember ever seeing somebody try to strip the inbounds [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=157.36s)]
*  passer before and getting a technical. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=160.16s)]
*  I feel like that might've made history for me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=162.48s)]
*  It probably happened at some point in my life, but I don't remember, but that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=164.84s)]
*  happens and I thought, Oh, that's gotta be two texts in the ball was only one [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=167.44s)]
*  tech, so they go up six, but they have the ball. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=170.68s)]
*  And then from that moment on the game just completely fell apart for them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=173.68s)]
*  And they had, there was bad defensive stuff like flag got beat for a layup. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=177.28s)]
*  They gave up that three when they were up six, when the, all they did was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=181.76s)]
*  basically just, you know, a little, a lazy high screen and both guys jumped [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=185.2s)]
*  on the one guy and all of a sudden somebody else was wide open. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=189.72s)]
*  They gave up the inbounds pass steal, a wide open three guy comes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=192.48s)]
*  flying in from the weak side and dunks it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=197.36s)]
*  And then, you know, the guards on Duke were terrible. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=199.84s)]
*  And I really think like, if you go on big picture, um, the fact that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=202.84s)]
*  you're trying to win a title, but you don't really have that one, I got a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  guy's guard, it really seems like that blows up in games like that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=210.28s)]
*  You're playing a big football stadium. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  There's a crazy pressure. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  Um, and then your sphincter start to get a little tight and you kind of need that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=218.68s)]
*  one guy who's like, I got it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  I got it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=223.28000000000003s)]
*  I got this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  And they didn't have anybody. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=224.24s)]
*  No, the guards killed them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=225.64s)]
*  Um, and it was, yeah, it's one field goal that Cooper three with the last 10 and a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=227.16s)]
*  half minutes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  So like, that's really the headline. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Like we can talk about a call or inbounding. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  It's like, how does Duke go 10 and a half minutes with only one made [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=235.2s)]
*  field goal throughout of it? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=238.56s)]
*  I think there's also like different discussions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=239.72s)]
*  They don't double Cooper on the last play. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=242.12s)]
*  If he hits that shot, does everybody go, Hey Houston, how do you play that straight [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=244.44s)]
*  up when you know that the ball's going to him that didn't hurt him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=247.64s)]
*  There was also the debate of after the technical free throw by Cooper, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=250.48s)]
*  Houston played it straight up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=254.36s)]
*  And my thing is always at home. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  It's it's kids, although, you know, some of the guys a little bit older now, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=257.48s)]
*  but I would foul. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  I would delay the game out as much as possible because I would expect the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=262.8s)]
*  younger guys just miss free throws and Houston plays it straight up, which I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  think, you know, we could debate it and granted people just play the result and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=268.76s)]
*  say, Hey, it's smart now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=272.68s)]
*  But in that moment, maybe Samson's going, Hey, these guys have been [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=273.72s)]
*  tight for a half an hour. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=276.68s)]
*  So let's not foul them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=278.12s)]
*  Let's let them run. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=280.2s)]
*  They're going to run it down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=281.88s)]
*  They're not going to get a great look. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  And if we play them straight up, you know, at this point, like maybe it's better [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=284.76s)]
*  than because they would have been down six if they, if they foul, who knows, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=289.32s)]
*  he makes it to, then it's probably over. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=293.52s)]
*  But to decide to play them straight up, which goes against everything I'm [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=295.64s)]
*  saying, but maybe even in the moment, it's like why some of these coaching [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=298.4s)]
*  philosophies don't apply to every single game because things are playing out [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  differently, Houston look in the Tennessee game, most teams, I think, are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=303.96s)]
*  have blown that lead to Tennessee because Tennessee was one of these teams. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  When you watch that first half against Kentucky, where you go, Oh my God, like [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=312.36s)]
*  this is overwhelming the energy, the effort, how hard these guys play. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  And Houston's the same thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=320.24s)]
*  And Houston's like, fine, you guys want to do this with us. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  We'll do it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  So I don't want to like, look, my least favorite thing ever is when the topic [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=324.68s)]
*  in the pre-show meeting is did Duke blow it or did Houston win it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=329.76s)]
*  And it's just stupid. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=333.68s)]
*  It's just stupid. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=334.8s)]
*  It's just stupid. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=335.64s)]
*  But it's also ignoring the fact that this is who Houston is. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=336.44s)]
*  This is a team that was down six with 10 seconds to go against Kansas and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  forces double overtime came. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=344.0s)]
*  So they believe it all the time. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  And so I want to credit him for that, but I still cannot believe that a team [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=348.84s)]
*  like Duke, that's this good, that this talented couldn't figure out the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=351.76s)]
*  inbounding thing because James was rattled those last four or five Houston [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=354.4s)]
*  relentless. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=358.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=360.32s)]
*  Because they believed that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  And there was a team that had a lot of 42 in the fifth quarter, making it [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=361.56s)]
*  Houston relentless made a couple of big shots made a couple of big defensive [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=364.84s)]
*  plays like blocking canipal when they were down six on that layup was, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=369.32s)]
*  you know, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=373.96s)]
*  Duke had the opposite plan the other end and they found the guy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=374.28s)]
*  Um, I was thinking about the big picture thing for me, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=377.23999999999995s)]
*  obviously flag, nobody's going to remember this game in five years. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=381.2s)]
*  Nobody's going to hold it against him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=384.76s)]
*  No, I mean for like, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=386.32s)]
*  for the flag NBA arc when he's like playing on Charlotte or whatever age 24, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  he's in the playoffs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=392.28s)]
*  Nobody's going to be like, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=393.12s)]
*  Hey, remember that time in the semifinals? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=393.84s)]
*  Honestly, I think it's going to hang on him. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the people are going to ask him about this game for the rest of his [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  life. Like, I don't know. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is awful, man. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=399.84s)]
*  This is all time. Like I know what you're saying. Like, oh, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=404.56s)]
*  I remember in the tournament, whatever. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  I think this was so big on this stage for a Duke team that so many people [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=408.64s)]
*  dislike, but yet here he is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=413.79999999999995s)]
*  And I'm watching him in this game going, I don't know where the flaws, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=416.0s)]
*  where's the flaw. Right. The more you watched him and I know he sucked in the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=418.44s)]
*  last two minutes. Did he suck? Well, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=422.28s)]
*  he gave up a couple of big defensive plays, gave up a big rebound. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=425.08s)]
*  He had the foul that over the back, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=429.24s)]
*  which was I thought one of the worst foul calls in a while. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=431.44s)]
*  But what I was going to say was I pushed back on that. He saw he, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=434.28s)]
*  well he sucked in the last two minutes. He did sucked, sucked in the last two [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=438.8s)]
*  minutes. They gave up, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=442.44s)]
*  they gave up like an absolute slaughter of a run and he was a big part of it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=443.64s)]
*  Defensively he was in multiple plays where his guy either beat him the basket [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=447.8s)]
*  or he gave up a wide open three and that switch. That was his fault. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=451.92s)]
*  When 7771 100% his fault on that gave up the weak side rebound. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm just saying it wasn't like I'm not sending. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=460.8s)]
*  He's not sending that two minutes to the hall of fame committee and be like, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  here's, here's my case. It was bad. So you were bad. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=465.56s)]
*  If you were scouting him, you would, you would be in the room going like, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=469.16s)]
*  I thought he was the best guy in that team by far. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=473.12s)]
*  But what I was going to say is that that last shot, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=476.16s)]
*  it's so funny how that, that fork in the road moment of like, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=479.96s)]
*  he gets the shot he wants. I thought it was going to go in and he front rimmed it, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=483.11999999999995s)]
*  but if it goes in, now it's like this completely different conversation, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  right? They skit, they survived the scare and he has like his Larry bird, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=492.76s)]
*  Carmelo moment and oh my God, and he's finished us with 29 points. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=496.84s)]
*  And he said it for a thing. And instead you're looking back like, oh, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=500.2s)]
*  that was really rough. I thought he got tight. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=504.35999999999996s)]
*  I thought the whole team got super tight proctor. Um, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=506.12s)]
*  looked like he didn't want to dribble anymore by the end of the game. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=509.24s)]
*  But that's the thing. These guys are flags 18. These guys are all kids. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=512.84s)]
*  That's what always makes me nervous. When I watch college sports, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=516.84s)]
*  I feel so bad that these guys are so young at the stage they're at, you know, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=519.2s)]
*  which just the kind of spotlight intention and pressure. Um, I don't think it, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=524.32s)]
*  I think you're wrong though. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=529.28s)]
*  I don't think it's going to hang on flag in the same way. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=530.36s)]
*  I thought he was really good for, for almost the entirety of the game. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=532.4s)]
*  Yeah. Are we saying two different things though? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=536.32s)]
*  Cause I don't, I mean, yeah, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=540.36s)]
*  I don't know that you're going to be having Kevin Harlan on a Thursday night, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=542.76s)]
*  TNT broadcast four nights from now going, well, 30 from Cooper, but you know, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=545.32s)]
*  they do in the scale. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=550.32s)]
*  The C web timeout game was clearly like, we'll be remembering this right. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=551.84s)]
*  When he called the, when he called the timeout that they didn't have dinner, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=556.92s)]
*  that thing that was like, oh shit, this one's going to fall. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=560.32s)]
*  I also think college basketball meant more when that happened. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=563.76s)]
*  But in this case, I don't know. I just thought, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=566.88s)]
*  I thought his team really stunk and I watched Duke a bunch of times this year. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=569.4s)]
*  That was that stretched in the second half. I thought was by far the worst. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=573.96s)]
*  I've seen them. It's kind of inexplicable that they couldn't score for that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=578.24s)]
*  long. I didn't really understand anything they were doing either. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=581.2s)]
*  No, I guess I'm still shocked that you thought he sucked the last two minutes. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=587.24s)]
*  I'm going to have to go back and watch the tape again. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=590.2s)]
*  You have to watch it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=591.96s)]
*  I think giving up a rebound or getting caught in rotation and somebody hitting a [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=593.0400000000001s)]
*  three, like that's basketball. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=596.32s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  What did he do good in the last two minutes? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=599.72s)]
*  Cause I watched it a couple of times today and I was like, ah, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=601.2800000000001s)]
*  you watched it a couple of times. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=605.08s)]
*  I did. There was a YouTube clip and I watched the last two minutes a couple of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=606.36s)]
*  times because I was so fascinated by it. When you have these things that fall [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  apart, it's almost like game six 86 where you're like, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  you're watching each pitch and like, oh, that could end of the game. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=617.0s)]
*  Ah, that could end of the game. And that Duke thing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  There was 10 plays at 90 seconds for you. Like, ah, if they get that one, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=623.88s)]
*  they win. Get the rebound. They win. You know, I don't know. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=627.2399999999999s)]
*  I guess, look, I think they ran down the clock too long on the Kniepel miss. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=630.88s)]
*  I think that Proctor missed the free throw. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=634.52s)]
*  I think Sion couldn't inbound the basketball and then he turned it over. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=636.5999999999999s)]
*  I think the three that made it, um, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=640.76s)]
*  the sharp three that made it 67, 64. That's a free for all. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  And you know, it's, it's kind of like, wait a minute, the sharp three. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  I think maybe I'm thinking about the other three. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  There's another three in here off the tip where it's a complete free for all. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=656.92s)]
*  And I don't even know how like anybody, you know, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=659.92s)]
*  it's kind of like one of those offensive rebound threes where you're just like [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=661.64s)]
*  everybody's so scattered the whole time. Um, I was surprised. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=663.8s)]
*  Did Rick Buecher try to argue that flag was fouled on the, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=667.5999999999999s)]
*  on the rebound? I couldn't, he was kind of saying, we don't know what his, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  I think he went with a mystery third arm defense, classic Rick Buecher, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=676.68s)]
*  but you could see his hand and I didn't want to like, you know, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=680.88s)]
*  how it is when you're tweeting out stuff and you go, well, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=685.4s)]
*  did you not factor in Sri Lanka's GDP in the turf? And you're like, okay. Um, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  I just look, they screwed up so many different times. It's not about that call, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=694.48s)]
*  but I can't believe an official in that moment is like, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=698.6s)]
*  I think I'm kind of ready to call something on this box out. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=700.96s)]
*  Like I think I'm ready. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=703.76s)]
*  It was the way Houston was pressing on those inbounds passes and how physical [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=704.6s)]
*  they were. You could have called a bunch of stuff that way either, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=708.4s)]
*  and they weren't. And then flags getting boxed out, going backwards. Um, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=710.68s)]
*  and I thought the guy took his right arm and kind of hooked flag from behind a [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  little bit from at least one of the angles, either way. I didn't, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=719.68s)]
*  it's just not a foul. Now Houston got the ball anyway, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=722.92s)]
*  but the issue for me is like make them have to make a shot to win the game. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=726.0s)]
*  Don't fail them out with some chintzy call that the guy was like, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=730.36s)]
*  it seemed like he was just dying to call. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=733.44s)]
*  He was calling it as they were still like as flag was tipping the ball. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=735.0s)]
*  I just didn't, I didn't get it. Uh, at that time in the game, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  I thought it was pretty inexcusable. So from a flag standpoint, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=742.28s)]
*  you don't think there's any way he goes back, right? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=746.2s)]
*  Cause that's another narrative. I don't see why he would. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=748.24s)]
*  No, like start the clock, start the clock on your max extension. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know why would you wait another year to do it? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=755.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's always left out when it's like, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=758.88s)]
*  well look at the rookie scale stuff for the NBA guys and look at what you could [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=760.48s)]
*  make and who knows what the NIL stuff. But I always think the NIL, NIL stuff, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=763.64s)]
*  although lucrative is can be really misleading. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=767.8000000000001s)]
*  Like contracts would just get announced like a lot of NFL stuff. It's like, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=771.08s)]
*  Russell only Russell Wilson, 21 and a half million here like, or 10, you know, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  so I think the NIL stuff, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=778.44s)]
*  Stefan digs 69 million for three. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. That's a really good one. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  It's really 20 for one. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=785.6s)]
*  It's exactly, it's exactly your point. The agent, the family, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=787.2s)]
*  everybody else is like start the clock for the rookie max extension. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=791.44s)]
*  In four years he can sign a max when he's 22 years old. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=795.76s)]
*  I don't know why you would delay that for any reason. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  He's also ready to play in the league. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=802.36s)]
*  It's not like one of those situations where, you know, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  and watching them a lot, it's been interesting. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=807.6s)]
*  Like ESPN ran a comps thing about him and I'm not positive there's a specific [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=808.96s)]
*  comp. There's pieces of different guys. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  There's some stuff he does that reminds me of Tatum, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=815.24s)]
*  even though they were completely different players, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=817.24s)]
*  but like body size, the fact that he can impact the game, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  the Tatum version now in all these different ways. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=822.0s)]
*  But then there's pieces of other dudes. I just think if I were him, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=824.72s)]
*  I'm coming in. There's a weird scenario though, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=828.36s)]
*  where he could potentially wait to see who gets the pick. Right. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=830.9200000000001s)]
*  Can he pull out by like the lottery happens mid May and he, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=835.96s)]
*  I think he can pull out like the end of May, something like that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=840.36s)]
*  So they changed the title. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=843.88s)]
*  It used to be this thing where the NBA withdrawal date was so much later than [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=845.24s)]
*  the NCAA one. Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=849.72s)]
*  And it was done on purpose because the coaches would just vote on it and say, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=851.5200000000001s)]
*  we want to know ahead of time. And then I think they changed it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=854.64s)]
*  Where either it's the same date or it aligns. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=857.64s)]
*  I think the unknown part of it, like if it were a franchise, you go, absolutely not. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=860.72s)]
*  I want nothing to do with this. Maybe, but you have new ownership in Charlotte. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=865.44s)]
*  You have winger running things with the wizards. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=870.48s)]
*  So there's at least things that you feel like, Hey, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=872.6s)]
*  the guy's making these decisions. It's different than what it was before. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=874.48s)]
*  So even though these teams aren't exactly. So if, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=877.44s)]
*  if you hated one of those scenarios that much, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=880.4s)]
*  would you actually delay it for NIL money that still would probably be close to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=883.6s)]
*  what your rookie scale would be as a first? I, I can't, I don't know. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=888.88s)]
*  He might not be the number one pick next year because there's a couple of dudes [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=892.04s)]
*  in next year's draft that everybody loves. You know, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=894.92s)]
*  you know you're the number one pick now. Yeah. So Surriday says the latter is May 15th. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=897.0s)]
*  He'd have a month to look at it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=902.12s)]
*  We have not had a scenario where somebody tried to power play the top pick or one [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=903.52s)]
*  of the top picks in a while. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=908.16s)]
*  Like Danny fairy famously did it when I was in college cause he didn't want to [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=909.6800000000001s)]
*  go to the Clippers and I've got shoving his way to the calves. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=913.64s)]
*  Steve Francis basically did it. He got drafted, was unhappy about it, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=916.64s)]
*  had one of the funniest NBA draft reactions probably ever where he's just like, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=921.44s)]
*  just seemed like he was being tortured that he went to Vancouver, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=927.0s)]
*  put the hat on, just kept looking up and then finally pushed the trade to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=930.48s)]
*  Houston. It really hasn't happened since then. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=933.76s)]
*  And I actually wonder why it doesn't happen more often because you always, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=936.72s)]
*  you know, we've been in this player empowerment era for 15 years now, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  but we haven't had a rookie come in and say, no, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=944.48s)]
*  I actually don't want to go to Charlotte. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=947.04s)]
*  So you can either trade the pick to somebody I want to go to, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=949.28s)]
*  or I'm just going to go back to Duke. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=953.16s)]
*  And I think he has real leverage now at the NIL to at least pretend you might [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=955.4s)]
*  want to do that. The problem for that theory is, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=958.56s)]
*  I don't think there's like a truly horrible team to go to this year in the NBA. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=961.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you like even Charlotte? Like, is that a bad situation? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=966.4s)]
*  Like they have a new front office, new owner. Everybody likes Charles Lee. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=969.3599999999999s)]
*  They have some assets. Like that's not a disaster. Washington's not a disaster. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=973.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't, I don't see a team where I'd be like, Oh man, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=976.4399999999999s)]
*  I feel so bad for him. He went there. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  No, I mean, I was looking at it this morning where I was like, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=982.4799999999999s)]
*  which team, if we were just being honest, be like, they don't deserve him. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=987.12s)]
*  Like how you used to get mad when Cleveland, you just said Philly. Philly. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=990.84s)]
*  Philly is the answer. It's the only answer. Yeah. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=995.12s)]
*  You're stumbling into it. I'm not even going to say sorry. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=999.24s)]
*  Organizational stuff. Yeah. Don't say sorry. They, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1001.48s)]
*  they played the season wrong and would somehow get compensated with that would [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1004.28s)]
*  be nuts. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1007.32s)]
*  Yeah. Cause you did a Cleveland rant. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1009.0s)]
*  I think what was it the third time they had won the lottery and you were on TV [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1010.6s)]
*  Yeah. The Cleveland fans got mad at me. That was absurd. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1014.76s)]
*  But I got your point. It's like, come on. Three times in five years, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1018.1600000000001s)]
*  the same team's going to win the number one pick. What are we doing? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1022.2s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? Philly? I think if you're talking about, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1025.6000000000001s)]
*  what would be the most interesting basketball situation for him, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1029.76s)]
*  the Philly one would be, um, at least on paper, the most interesting. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1033.08s)]
*  I don't know if it would be the best for him because now, now he's on the, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  are you playing or you're not playing clock? He's on the Paul George, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1041.32s)]
*  whatever the hell's going on there, but at least he'd have good guards. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1044.9599999999998s)]
*  But I think Washington would be the most fun for him from a, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1048.24s)]
*  just as a basketball fan, just cause of the weird pieces they have. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1050.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think he would fit in with the guys they have and you know, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  be, be some sort of connector. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1059.4399999999998s)]
*  The most positive thing that you can say about him is that he's actually not [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1062.0s)]
*  going to need the ball to impact games immediately. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1065.76s)]
*  So whenever you think about a draft pick, that could be the face of your [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1068.16s)]
*  franchise, I mean, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1071.12s)]
*  cause if we're talking like best case scenarios and him being this prospect [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1071.68s)]
*  that we've all been hearing about, even though there was a chance, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1074.48s)]
*  I think there was conversation beginning of the year of like, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1077.08s)]
*  could the Rutgers guys surpass him? And then the year plays out and you're just [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1078.8s)]
*  like, okay, well there's obviously everybody's on the same page now. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1083.24s)]
*  There's no question that he's the number one guy, but he, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1085.76s)]
*  your Tatum thing, at least now I think actually rings true cause you're like, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1090.2s)]
*  Hey Tatum's playing point guard for this team and flag initiates so much of [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1093.8s)]
*  their offense. But he also, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1097.76s)]
*  one of the things I loved about Palo is that Palo could have taken every shot [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1099.52s)]
*  and been justified when Duke was in those tight games, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1102.4s)]
*  but Palo still wanted to set up other people. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  He had what I think is like shot make star quality shot making stuff, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1106.76s)]
*  but yet a deferential thing that actually works well with other talented players [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1111.16s)]
*  where I think young guys have to get to a point where like, Hey, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  you just can't like cool scoring bro, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1117.0s)]
*  but you can't just do all of this on yourself and ignore everything else that's [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1119.4s)]
*  going around you. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1122.52s)]
*  Cooper could not take shots and impact the game. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1123.6s)]
*  His passing is insane. His instincts are great. His footwork, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  all the athleticism, the body control and the shooting ended up being even better, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1131.36s)]
*  I think, than people thought this year. So he's really like a plug and play guy. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1135.6s)]
*  I guess the only knock would be almost like the women, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1139.32s)]
*  Yama thing where you go, okay, in five years is women, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1141.1999999999998s)]
*  Yama like figuring out a way to score on his own in the Western conference [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  finals. I think clearly, you know, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1148.04s)]
*  that's like being a really hard on one, but Yama and I think with Cooper, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1150.96s)]
*  because if you're going to be one of these, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1154.64s)]
*  there's not 10 guys in the league that probably fit this standard. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1156.76s)]
*  I don't know how many you think there are, but okay, we have a real dude. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1159.76s)]
*  We're actually like in this not, Hey, every year we have a chance to win a title, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1164.44s)]
*  but we're at least like, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1168.64s)]
*  we look like a conference finals team because that's the hope when you get one [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1169.64s)]
*  of these guys and is he somebody that can score in all those busted up [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1172.48s)]
*  possessions. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1175.8000000000002s)]
*  And that would be maybe the only thing where you go ceiling wise, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1176.44s)]
*  like he projects to maybe do that, but that's what will make the difference. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1180.08s)]
*  Yeah. There's some tough advanced metrics with him with like the perimeter shots, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1183.6s)]
*  like that 15 to 20 feet range. You saw it last night. He missed it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1187.24s)]
*  But the thing is he's 18. He's a year younger than he probably should be. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1190.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm just like, if you're just looking, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1194.08s)]
*  go back and look at Tatum tape when he was at Duke or first year Celtics, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1196.08s)]
*  like he had a couple of things he could do. And other than that, he was like, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1199.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1204.04s)]
*  a baby deer in the woods trying to figure everything out and flag is where it, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1204.3999999999999s)]
*  what I see from an all around game is closer to the Tatum now than that Tatum [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1209.52s)]
*  in 2018. But I don't, I don't really know if he has a comp. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1214.48s)]
*  I don't think he's the same kind of natural score, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1217.4s)]
*  but there's so many other awesome things he does. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1219.5600000000002s)]
*  I can't wait to see him in the league. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  And the bummer for him is just from a big picture standpoint, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1225.0s)]
*  he had a chance to have this start to finish college season. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1228.8000000000002s)]
*  That just would have been mentioned with Davis in 2012, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1231.48s)]
*  Carmelo and some of the great seasons. And now that's pulled away. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1234.76s)]
*  I don't think this loss sticks to him though. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1238.2s)]
*  It really felt like a team, a team collapsed to me. Yeah, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1241.76s)]
*  that shot they'll replay it, but big picture, like this, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1246.04s)]
*  say here's a first take segment for you. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  Is it better to lose or win a game like this? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1252.96s)]
*  If you're trying to become a great NBA player someday, do you need like, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1255.24s)]
*  do you need the agony, the thing to go back to during the summer, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1260.36s)]
*  the pain of that one loss and be like, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1264.68s)]
*  I never want to have that feeling again. In some ways you could argue, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1266.68s)]
*  that's actually probably better. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1269.72s)]
*  Burt always said like getting his ass kicked by magic in the final game was [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1271.24s)]
*  actually a really good thing for him. It gave him like a whole other level of, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1275.4s)]
*  of a drive. So I don't know. There's a, there's a dumb silver lining. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1279.48s)]
*  Too easy if they won right away. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1284.8s)]
*  Are you saying MJ and magic, could they have been better had they lost their [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1287.48s)]
*  title games? If MJ had missed that shot, maybe he wins eight titles. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1291.6s)]
*  Maybe he never plays baseball again. We're saying two different things though. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1295.08s)]
*  We're saying two different things on the Cooper, how this sticks to him. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1298.2s)]
*  I'm looking at it as he's going to be at the gas station in Maine when he's 60 [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1301.6s)]
*  and some guy's going to come up to him and say, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1307.0s)]
*  I can't believe you lost that game. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1310.84s)]
*  As if he hasn't heard it his entire life when I was watching him and like, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1312.6399999999999s)]
*  I think, I don't know if I was reading lifts correctly, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1316.08s)]
*  but when Shire had him in the timeout and they were getting ready to inbound, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  I think he said to some like, it's your time, right? Like go, like, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1321.16s)]
*  go make it happen. Yeah. And how different now, granted, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1324.7600000000002s)]
*  they still have to be Florida, which is, you know, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1327.24s)]
*  a really good college basketball team. So maybe we're assuming a lot. Um, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1329.5200000000002s)]
*  but he's, he's going to be reminded of this probably [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1333.8400000000001s)]
*  every day in some fashion for the rest of his life. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1338.88s)]
*  And it's going to be brutal. And you're right. I think the thing that we're, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1343.2s)]
*  we're separate on is that it's not going to stick to him as if it's a [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1346.96s)]
*  knock on who he is as a player. And he's, you know, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1350.68s)]
*  he has this great NBA career. None of this is really going to matter. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1353.44s)]
*  Plenty of guys have lost. They've lost, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1357.0800000000002s)]
*  but this was just such a dramatic loss to blow it this way and to have. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1358.68s)]
*  So what was the last time we had a college basketball loss like this? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1363.0800000000002s)]
*  This was like old school. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1369.28s)]
*  Is this the Memphis, Kansas one when they don't make their free throws? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1372.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good one. That was 2008. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. That was like 17 years ago. It just doesn't happen the same way. Wait, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1380.44s)]
*  one more thing on the NCA. Um, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1384.1200000000001s)]
*  you talked about the Florida guy last week and how much you liked him. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1387.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1391.08s)]
*  And then you watch him last night and he just looks like he's doing a Jamal [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1392.52s)]
*  Murray impersonation. And I guess now he's crept into the, uh, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1395.92s)]
*  into the first round and I don't really know the knocks. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1400.52s)]
*  He's not as tall as Murray is and he's older. He's 22, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1404.44s)]
*  which they always seem to penalize guys with, but, um, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1408.12s)]
*  he's been impressive enough that I'm now rooting to see him go to a decent team [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1410.92s)]
*  in the draft, maybe a team where he could, uh, play. I'm talking about Clayton, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1416.68s)]
*  but, uh, but I, I, I've just been, uh, really, really, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1420.96s)]
*  really blown away by his shot making and how he seems to have a sense for when, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1425.24s)]
*  when his team needs him to do something, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1433.28s)]
*  If he's on Duke last night, they Duke doesn't lose the game. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1436.04s)]
*  So where do you see him? I know you only started doing the draft stuff, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1439.44s)]
*  but where just, where do you see him in that whole context? Does this, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1442.56s)]
*  does this even matter when these teams are looking at this in June? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1446.48s)]
*  Older not jump off the screen at you athleticism. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1450.64s)]
*  So I think that's where I like, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1455.0s)]
*  I look back at some of the mocks and there was one in the beginning of this [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1456.28s)]
*  month where he wasn't even a second round pick. Right. And that's where, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1459.2s)]
*  um, again, a late to this, but the Tennessee SEC tournament game, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1463.1999999999998s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, you know, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1468.24s)]
*  and then he's basically been that the entire time we talked about the Texas tech [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  shot. Uh, but what he can do, I'm not comparing him to Steph. Okay. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1473.08s)]
*  But what makes Steph a great shooter is that Steph can have a bad foundation [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1477.48s)]
*  that Steph can change the release of it, even though it all kind of comes back. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1480.84s)]
*  You know, it's almost like a Dirk thing. If you looked at Dirk's foundation, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1484.6799999999998s)]
*  you would never say, Hey, do what that guy's doing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1487.84s)]
*  But everything was always adjusted for whatever the release was going to be. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1490.28s)]
*  So there's some guys that are just catching shoot. They can never move. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1493.56s)]
*  They develop the muscle memory enough that if they catch and shoot in a certain [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1497.2s)]
*  spot, they put up like a really good number, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1500.36s)]
*  but I don't know that it makes you a well rounded shooter. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  And what we see with Clayton is that he can be that, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1504.36s)]
*  that corner three that he hit from the left side or excuse me, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1507.68s)]
*  it was the right side. So right corner, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1511.08s)]
*  he's adjusting all of his like arm and release point to get away from the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1513.56s)]
*  contest. And then it's natural. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1518.08s)]
*  He also had a drive in the left side where he had read it and he knew what was [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1520.4399999999998s)]
*  going to happen and he knew he was going to get fouled. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1523.36s)]
*  So he's preparing himself to even throw the ball up at the rim. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1525.52s)]
*  And it wasn't even an and one, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1528.1999999999998s)]
*  but there's just stuff with him that even if he's not off the page, you know, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1530.12s)]
*  or I should say off the charts, athletically, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1534.0s)]
*  compared to some of the other guys, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1536.04s)]
*  he seems to keep getting past everybody the entire time. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1537.6399999999999s)]
*  And there's some players when you're doing the draft, you're like, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1540.6s)]
*  I don't know if he's like the most dynamic or the most quick. And it's like, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1542.56s)]
*  okay, but he just keeps, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1545.1599999999999s)]
*  he just keeps getting past everybody every single time and his pace and his, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1546.96s)]
*  his comfort in the biggest moments. I haven't done it, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1551.52s)]
*  but I guess I'd have a hard time believing that there's 30 guys that go ahead [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1555.2800000000002s)]
*  of him. Even at the age. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1559.88s)]
*  I would add the, uh, the way he finishes after he, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1562.2s)]
*  after he bounces into somebody in a drive and still finishes with touch. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1566.24s)]
*  That's the thing that reminds me of Murray the most, like his, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1571.0s)]
*  when Murray's really going, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1573.52s)]
*  he has this ability to kind of bounce off dudes and finish anyway. Um, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1574.64s)]
*  I think he's really impressive. And I was mad. I had a, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1579.2s)]
*  I had the Auburn Duke parlay last night, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1583.08s)]
*  which then I had to chase with Duke Clippers. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1585.92s)]
*  So it was a double loss for me last night. Um, but I, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1587.8s)]
*  I just thought Auburn was better. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1591.96s)]
*  And then as you're watching him take over the second half, like, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1593.52s)]
*  why the fuck did I bet against this guy? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1595.96s)]
*  This guy thinks he's the best guy in this tournament. I'm not, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1597.32s)]
*  I'm not doing that again. All right, we got to get, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1599.52s)]
*  the only thing just to add to it though, cause I've been doing it now, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1601.72s)]
*  where like on FanDuel, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1605.32s)]
*  I hedged it with a Florida Houston, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1607.3600000000001s)]
*  Florida over Houston plus seven 50 title. So I was like, I love Duke. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1610.96s)]
*  I love them in this game. And then you're sitting here going, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1615.32s)]
*  I still don't feel like I was wrong. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1618.68s)]
*  Plenty of games where you're like, I'm just wrong on this one. So yeah, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaUfhIRoXF4&t=1621.88s)]
