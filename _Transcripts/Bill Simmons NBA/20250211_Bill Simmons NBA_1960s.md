# Mavericks Fans Revolt Over the Luka Doncic Trade | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ)
*  All right. So Curtis, you're from Texas. You're a lifelong Cowboys fan. You're a lifelong Mavericks fan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Maybe not as much, but a student of the Mavericks that been in your life. It's been a rocky road. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  There's been a lot of ups and downs. Everything peaked in 2011 with Dirk DeWitschke and probably [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=13.36s)]
*  winning the title, beating, beating Wade and LeBron and Bosch. And it got weird over the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  course of the decade. They miraculously ended up with Luka Doncic. Cuban sells the team last year. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  They just seem like if you're picking six franchises you want to be for the next 10 years, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=30.48s)]
*  they would have been one of the six because they had Luka out of nowhere. They trade them [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=34.72s)]
*  in the most shocking, craziest trade in the history of the NBA. And just when you think, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=38.8s)]
*  all right, maybe this will settle down. It just hasn't. It just keeps going up a level and up a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=44.0s)]
*  level and up a level. What just your big picture watching this from afar, holy shit. What is your [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  take? I feel like quoting that notorious Darren Revelle tweet. This is terrible for Dallas, but [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=56.08s)]
*  this is tremendous content because you recognize the pain and I have never seen Dallas people this [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=62.4s)]
*  emotionally gutted. So even like Cowboys, Superbowl losses, nothing. Well, it's okay. So [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=70.64s)]
*  maybe not gutted, but just angry. Like there've been a lot of angry Jerry moments over the last [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=76.4s)]
*  30 years. I was in middle school when they fired Tom Landry. I was in high school when Jimmy Johnson [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=80.48s)]
*  got axed by Jerry. I remember those were just crazy city-wide moments of like, what the hell [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=85.6s)]
*  just happened. But I've never seen the anger like I've seen over the last week and change. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  Just pissed off. I mean, like visiting even with Dallas sports radio guys. And by the way, Monday [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=98.8s)]
*  was one of the last Monday, one of the all time sports radio days in Dallas history and probably [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  American history when they were coming back and doing their shows. Oh, and you know, morning and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=108.08s)]
*  through the afternoon, first time you were getting your first time to talk about it. And I was like, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=112.4s)]
*  you know, even going up to them, wow, what a day, huh? And they just look like gutted. I mean, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=116.4s)]
*  you know, because everything changes, you know, this, this guy you loved, this person you were [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  close to the fact that it was done by Nico Harrison and Patrick Dumont will probably get into here in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=127.92s)]
*  a second. Yeah. And the way it was done and for what they got, I mean, every piece of it is just [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=132.96s)]
*  absolutely infuriating and gutting. Well, and then this next level would happen at the home [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=139.68s)]
*  game yesterday where people are getting booed and they're removing fans, which [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=146.0s)]
*  we're moving for not, not doing anything that bad. They're just like being fans. Like they, like I've [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=150.32s)]
*  never seen people get pulled out of the arena for the stuff that they got pulled out of last night. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=157.04s)]
*  Have you? Yeah. Did you see the one guy, right? So they're doing Mavs karaoke. Yeah. They come in real [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=161.28s)]
*  close, like a close-up on him and he says fire Nico. And then the camera goes, whoop. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=166.56s)]
*  Right. It was almost like he flashed, like he pulled it out out of a zipper. And then they just [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=171.76s)]
*  got, they, they were just dumping fans, which is that's the worst thing you could do. Like it's, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=177.04s)]
*  not only did they do this crazy trade, but they don't seem to understand like how angry it's made [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=182.96s)]
*  people. And they don't really seem that interested in quelling the anger. It's like they're just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=188.96s)]
*  taking gasoline and pouring it on the fire. You get escorted out of the arena for saying fire Nico [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=192.72s)]
*  for saying fire the GM. Are they going to escort the sports writers out of press row who wrote the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=198.08s)]
*  same thing? I mean, why, why is that not a valid opinion? Well, the other weird thing in this bit [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=204.32s)]
*  kind of speaks to the incompetence behind the trade. How did they not anticipate any of this? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Like they they're in Dallas, like Nico Harrison has been involved with the Mavericks longer than [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=214.32s)]
*  the owner, but he's there. He sees how popular Luca is. You go to any Mavericks game, it's Luca [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=219.28s)]
*  jerseys everywhere. I mean, I would say it's a top four fans wearing the Jersey of the best player [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=224.48s)]
*  NBA city. It's just, it's just everywhere. And, and little kids everywhere. 77 just everywhere. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=231.6s)]
*  There was a couple when I, when I was going to the finals, there was a couple of dirks, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=239.12s)]
*  a couple old school math stuff, but for the most part it's just Luca. It's like, it's like a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=242.96s)]
*  fucking Luca army. This was their guy. They've had him since he was 18. They thought they're [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=246.64s)]
*  going to have until he was 40. So to not anticipate that part of it is like, man, I really think this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  makes us slightly better, but my life is going to suck for the rest of the time I live here, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=256.96s)]
*  just that alone. And then you have Polinka on the other end going, yeah, we got to keep this quiet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  Nobody can find out. Cause he knows the moment it leaks out, the Mavs fans are going to basically [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=267.2s)]
*  riot. Um, it's, it's, I've never seen anything like this from a hubris slash lack of awareness [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=271.04s)]
*  dating back, unless you go back to like the eighties when the league was, you know, everyone was on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=283.68s)]
*  cocaine and the league was fucking crazy and the teams are worth $12 million and weird shit happened. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=288.16s)]
*  This is like out of the eighties. Yeah. And how about Jason kid? No postgame presser last night. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  Wasn't that great? Which day everyone was saying this has like never happened before with any Mavs [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=297.76s)]
*  team. We've never seen a coach just skip the presser. We're taping this at it's 10 o'clock PT. We [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=302.96s)]
*  might find out today Davis is out for like two months. Yeah. I mean, that was, that was also kind [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  of a news dump. Super Bowl two, a wait AD is actually hurt. I mean, the whole thing, I mean, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=312.48s)]
*  you say like he didn't anticipate it, but I feel like he did to some extent because I feel like the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=319.04s)]
*  secrecy was driven by Palenque as you say, so there were no other offers, no other suitors, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=323.92s)]
*  but I think Harrison kept it quiet too, because he didn't want to face the backlash. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  He knew it would get crushed. So in the way, like you were kind of anticipating, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=333.04s)]
*  but maybe not anticipating how big it would be. Right. Well, this has, I mean, the Patrick Dumont [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=336.8s)]
*  piece of this, as it's evolved, I wrote down the funniest outcomes of the Luca trade so far. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=344.24s)]
*  Here we go. And it's a long list. Everyone made this point, but a trade so bad. People thought [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=351.84s)]
*  Shams got hacked. Let's just start there. That's never happened before in the history of professional [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  sports, where we assume the best reporter of a sport got hacked. Palenque addressing like a fast [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  and furious villain for the post trade conference. I loved just like decked out. Like he, like he was [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  about to do a concert in New Zealand with it. Like he, like he used to be in a new kids in the block [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  and now he's got a solo career. I love this one. Everyone's still pretending that Jason Kidd, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=381.12s)]
*  JJ Reddick, LeBron, Rich Paul, and Anthony Davis didn't know about the trade. This is my favorite. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=390.0s)]
*  They're still doing it. It's like, this is like playhouse theater. If people think Jason Kidd [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=396.88s)]
*  didn't know about this trade, I got like a bridge to sell you. It's unbelievable that they're still [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=401.6s)]
*  pushing this. AD, and we talked about this the day after the, on this pod, the day after the trade, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=406.8s)]
*  like AD waved his trade kicker and gave up $5.9 million in like 40 minutes to make the trade work. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=412.48s)]
*  There's no way he didn't know. It's impossible. He has this huge house out here in LA. He loved [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=419.04s)]
*  being on the Lakers. He had to have known all these people knew and they're still doing it all these [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  days later. Well, it was so important. We had to just keep it between the owners and Nico and Rob. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  And that was all, it couldn't get out. Why couldn't it get out? Why? Because you knew the Mavericks fans [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=436.32s)]
*  were going to fucking riot if it got out because it was so stupid. That's why I couldn't get out. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=442.24s)]
*  Totally. They tried to square the circle at that Nico press conference, which was also one of the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=446.4s)]
*  great moments in this whole thing where he said, JJ Kidd didn't know, but we were aligned on the vision. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=450.0s)]
*  Right. Well, but then they said he didn't know until the 11th hour. It's like, you mean the 11th [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=456.56s)]
*  hour of a 24 hour day? Cause there's no fucking way you traded Luca without telling Jason Kidd [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=461.52s)]
*  and talking him through it. Like, first of all, that's, that's insane. If you're running a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=466.64s)]
*  basketball team and you're not going to walk through all the mechanics of here's door A and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=470.96s)]
*  here's door B. And also like they were complaining about Luca behind the scenes for like two years. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  There's no way Jason Kidd wasn't a huge part of this trade. And by the way, Jason Kidd, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=481.12s)]
*  not exactly the most stand up dude over the years. Like this is the guy who stabbed Brooklyn in the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=486.08s)]
*  back so he could get the Milwaukee job. Like he's, he's let the trail of bodies everywhere. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=490.56s)]
*  Like the nets in 2007, all of a sudden he got out of there. Like this is not like Mr. loyal, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=495.52s)]
*  awesome team employee guys. So I just give me a break on that. And then LeBron, like the way he [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=502.0s)]
*  reacted to the trade after, like if they, if they really blindsided on this, there's no way, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=509.68s)]
*  no way that he reacts the way he did, which was like, Oh yeah, well wait and see. I just think [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=515.12s)]
*  everybody knew this was better. This was a better situation for LeBron. It actually gave him a chance [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=520.16s)]
*  to win a title. It was better for AD to go to Dallas. Anyway, that was one of my favorites. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  We mentioned Nico saying they kept the trade talks quiet because neither side wanted it to leak. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=529.6s)]
*  You mean you didn't want it to leak because the moment it got out, there's no way the fan base [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  would let you do it. Patrick Demont's interview over the weekend, when he said Kobe was a culture [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  builder and Kobe's coach in 2005 wrote an entire book about how awful it was to coach Kobe. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=544.64s)]
*  And then Shaq was the guy who was always in shape. Shaq's work ethic, which was like the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=551.92s)]
*  most famous thing about Shaq, the whole, in my book of basketball, the whole thing I wrote about [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=556.24s)]
*  Shaq was that Shaq could have graduated with a four road instead. He graduated with a three, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  seven and had a great time. Like that was Shaq. Mark Cuban, a week late doing the whole, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=565.68s)]
*  I tried to stop it as soon as I found out, but it was too late because he probably was walking [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=574.32s)]
*  around for a week with everybody just crushing them on the trade. And finally he had to like [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=578.72s)]
*  get some peace out to Mark's side and like, Hey, can you, can you put out that? I had nothing to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  do with this. Like there's really no blood on my hands. The Mavs trading Luca because he couldn't [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=588.64s)]
*  stay in shape and was always an injury risk. But then they got Anthony Davis who got hurt in the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=594.32s)]
*  first game. Like you can't make this up. Somebody whose nickname is street clothes. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=598.16s)]
*  Right. This guy, this guy's better. I liked, I don't, who knows that Dave McBenamon story yesterday [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=603.36s)]
*  when it was like LeBron's camp has noticed that Luca got what he wanted right away. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=612.72s)]
*  That was an amazing sentence. And LeBron has been pushing for this stuff for years. First of all, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=617.6s)]
*  LeBron's played with just in the last 14 years, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=622.72s)]
*  Anthony Davis and Luca Dacic. He plays on a Lakers team when they traded for AD. They traded [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=627.92s)]
*  two top two lottery picks Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball. They pushed Julius Randall out, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  who is another lottery pick. They traded the number four pick that became Deandre Hunter. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  They put Josh Hart in the trade. They put Mo Wagner in the trade. They traded like two more swaps and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=645.52s)]
*  picks, including the one that became Dyson Daniels. And they have another pick this year. Like they [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=651.36s)]
*  gave away like basically a decade of drafts combined with the two Westbrook trades. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=655.36s)]
*  How much can you do for this guy? So I almost don't believe that he couldn't have, there's no way he [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  really feels like they're not doing enough for him. Anyway, that made me laugh. And then [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  all the math stuff with just, hey, let's hold our heads high and thank Luca for seven years. And he [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=673.12s)]
*  brought us to the Western finals and the finals. And this was great, good luck in LA. No, they did [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=678.88s)]
*  the opposite. They just leak shit left and right. He's a fat piece of shit. Maybe he had a drinking [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=683.68s)]
*  problem. His calves could explode. Watch out for his Achilles. There's so many things that are [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=688.88s)]
*  leaking out. It's disgusting. It was. And you know me, I'm a student of the Now They Tell a Story. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=694.4799999999999s)]
*  And just as soon as this trade came down, we were all on the clock, right? You guys even said it on [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=699.8399999999999s)]
*  the emergency podcast. Yeah, here we go. Here we go. But it never really came out because there's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=703.8399999999999s)]
*  really not a reason for this, right? There's not a great answer. There's always an answer with these [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=709.84s)]
*  things, with these weird stories, what happened? What are the motives here? And the answer is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=716.4s)]
*  it was Nico Harrison. Like he didn't have it. He didn't have a good reason. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=722.48s)]
*  He just did it. Right. He did this stupid, incredibly stupid thing. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=726.72s)]
*  Well, and then Dumont, the owner or the guy who's running stuff, the more I talk to people and I [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=731.36s)]
*  keep looking for conspiracy theories or whatever. And it just seems like they just felt like they [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=738.64s)]
*  didn't like that he wasn't in shape and they thought he was kind of a dick. And that just seems like [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=744.72s)]
*  the, that's why they didn't want to give him 350 million. This is the all time new owner syndrome [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=748.56s)]
*  trade we've ever had. We've had so many great ones over the years where somebody takes over a team and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=754.24s)]
*  within a couple of months, they're like, here's my idea. And it's usually a disaster. This is the worst [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=759.36s)]
*  one ever. Yes. But usually you're paying too much for another star, right? That's the new owner. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=763.68s)]
*  That's the nets. That's the sons, right? You're going out like, let's go get an aging star and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=769.3599999999999s)]
*  spend way too much capital. Go get that guy. This is the opposite. It's the opposite, but [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=774.7199999999999s)]
*  the spirit is always the same. It's always somebody moving into the league who's had some either had [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=780.8s)]
*  some success somewhere else or inherited the success he had. And they go in and within a year, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=786.56s)]
*  they think they're smarter than everybody else. That's always the North star where they come in [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=793.2s)]
*  and they're like, they're just trying to do a zag, right? They're not like, I just want to come in. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=799.5200000000001s)]
*  I want to learn this business for three or four years, trust the people that are in here. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=805.36s)]
*  I want to be a student of the game. There's a lot of stuff I don't know yet. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=810.48s)]
*  It's always more like the Ishby thing where it's like, nope, everybody's doing this. So I'm going [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=814.08s)]
*  to do this. Like Prokhorov was another classic in Brooklyn, right? He's just like, picks, what are [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=820.0s)]
*  those? Spend those. And then a year later he's like, yeah, cut costs. That was stupid. And then, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=825.2s)]
*  and then he just demolishes the nets for a decade, but they all have to do it. Even, even Ballmer, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=829.2s)]
*  who I think was one of the better new owners, but Ballmer, he took over and within a couple years, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=835.84s)]
*  they had traded Blake Griffin, Chris Paul was out. And that was probably one of the more successful [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=842.48s)]
*  ones, but they all have to do it. You know, what really pisses me off about this is, and this is [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=848.0s)]
*  like, comes from a more personal place is that you and I, before we worked together, both worked with [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=853.36s)]
*  people in our lives who would make our lives hell. And it wasn't that we had like, I care about [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=859.36s)]
*  journalism. You care about journalism intensely. We're just butting heads over the particular [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=866.08s)]
*  vision. We would look at them and be like, you actually don't care that much. You just like [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=870.4s)]
*  having a job. And when you don't have this job anymore, you're going to go off and do another [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=875.04s)]
*  job. And you're never going to think about this again. And I'm going to think about this for the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=879.36s)]
*  rest of my life, this moment, because I'm so pissed off. That's Maverick fans to me. Nico Harrison's [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=883.76s)]
*  going to do a couple more years of GM and then he's going to never do this job again. And he [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=889.92s)]
*  won't think about this as, oh, that was a great failure in my life. He's like, oh, that was weird. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=893.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, a couple of weird years in my career and I'm going to go work with my buddy Rob again. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=897.36s)]
*  And, you know, it just doesn't matter. And Patrick Dumont, it'll move. He'll be out of Texas. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=901.8399999999999s)]
*  Patrick Dumont will never think about this again. And I just guarantee it. And that is what's just [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=907.12s)]
*  particularly galling about this whole deal to me. Well, and also that Patrick Dumont clearly was [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=912.0s)]
*  not a huge basketball fan probably in the last six or seven years. Just based on that one interview [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=917.92s)]
*  he gave. There's wrinkles to this that I think tie in to where basketball is kind of moving anyway. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=923.92s)]
*  And I've noticed that with my friends' kids, especially kids, maybe my son's age and under [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=931.68s)]
*  where they root for the player over the team. I think video games have something to do with this. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=938.64s)]
*  I think all the player movement has stuff to do with this. I also just think basketball's different. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=944.72s)]
*  Guys jump around now. So it's easier to just grab a player than a team. But it's definitely one of the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=949.28s)]
*  player empowerment LeBron generation. This is one of the side effects. It's like, I like Wessel [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=955.04s)]
*  Westbrook. Now he's on the Nuggets. So now I'm a Nuggets fan. This Luka thing is the most interesting [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=960.4s)]
*  test case for this because I know of a few people who either it's them specifically, their kids, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  or people they know who are like, my kid's a Laker fan now. This is it. We've actually given up on the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=975.68s)]
*  Mavericks. He's just going to follow Luka to the Lakers. He's going to root for the Lakers from now [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=983.68s)]
*  on. I don't remember a bigger version of this in any sport. Like when Brady went to the Bucs, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=987.84s)]
*  the Pats fans, we rooted for him. Like I rooted for him during the Super Bowl, but I was never like, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm now a Bucs fan. Like we stayed the Pats fan. This is actually like, it feels like they've lost [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=999.2800000000001s)]
*  fans over this, which I don't remember happening. It's really fascinating because I'm like you. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1004.1600000000001s)]
*  I have my teams that I've had since childhood and it never changed. I never family a second NBA team [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1008.72s)]
*  or a second. Like that's bullshit. Get out of here with that. This is the one time I wouldn't blame [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1014.24s)]
*  anybody for doing it. I mean, Dirk sitting there blessing the whole thing last night with, you know, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  and Luka doing the Dirk trademark shot. Dirk, by the way, greatest player in Mav's history, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  who after he won a title did a diners drive ins and dives tour. I mean, staying in shape. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1030.32s)]
*  I mean, so I wouldn't blame anybody if you're just a Luka fan. And now even with all the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1037.84s)]
*  changes you talk about with what the Mavericks did, why not? Why wouldn't you just keep rooting [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1043.36s)]
*  for him no matter where he's playing? The other, the other thing I was thinking about [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1047.76s)]
*  just from a historical standpoint with this trade, which speaks to the fact that they had a, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1052.08s)]
*  you know, a sports business executive who doesn't seem like he was a true basketball fan. Nico, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  maybe he is, but it's just like his lack of understanding of the history of this stuff was [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1064.0s)]
*  really notable. And then Dumont, who clearly isn't a basketball fan, but there's been so many great [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  players who hit kind of this weird inflection point that Luka seemed to be in, right? Where [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1073.28s)]
*  he's 25, he wasn't at his all time peak yet. You could talk yourself into, yeah, maybe this is [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1079.92s)]
*  never going to happen. And ironically, the Mavericks had one of those guys in Dirk Nowitzki [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1085.52s)]
*  when they made the finals with them in 06, the MVP season in 07, and then they lose to the Warriors [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1090.56s)]
*  in round one. And then around 08, it really seemed to go sideways and he had some issues. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  He got involved with a woman that became a thing where he had this bad relationship. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1102.48s)]
*  In 08, 09, you really felt like Dirk was gettable and that the ship had sailed on him being an [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1108.08s)]
*  awesome player. And they didn't trade with that. Cuban was like, I'm never trading this guy. Cuban [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1113.84s)]
*  had a chance to trade him in, you know, in 04 for Shaq. That was when Shaq became available. It was [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1118.16s)]
*  like the obvious trade was Dirk for Shaq. He's like, I'm not trading Dirk. Dirk's our guy. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1124.16s)]
*  And they just kept him. But there's been other guys over the years when people, when teams have [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1128.24s)]
*  blinked, when they've had, you know, they're like, ah, should we trade them? Especially when you go [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1133.36s)]
*  back to the seventies and eighties, this is the first time in a while a team blinked. Yeah. You [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1138.56s)]
*  know, even Minnesota with KG, like they, they never traded them. The Wizards did it with C-Web, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1142.8s)]
*  but C-Web like never had any real success. Luca had real success. He made the finals last year, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  did the Western finals. Like he, he was actually winning shit. So this, this is why I think one of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1153.84s)]
*  the many reasons I was even going back, I was reading Houston and Hakeem Olajuwon, because in [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1159.84s)]
*  92 and 93, and you could read, there's a ton of stuff about this. Like he almost got traded the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  Quippers. He was being shopped around. There was a Reggie Lewis possible trade at one point, like, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  but they never trade them. They kept them. So this happened before, but this is the rare time where [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1175.28s)]
*  the team just blinked. And it's so early to blink. It's so early. I mean, 29 year old Luca, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1179.36s)]
*  you know, maybe you never get back to the finals. You got the Western Conference finals one more [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1186.9599999999998s)]
*  time. Right. Then you trade him for seven first round picks and some 22 year old. That's the only [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1190.9599999999998s)]
*  way it makes sense. Yeah. And he has like two seasons in there where he plays like 45 games [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1197.28s)]
*  and then you're starting to, eh, you know, long-term conditioning, whatever, but this is way too early [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1201.36s)]
*  to even entertain that idea. The other piece of this trade, which I'm happy to go on the record [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1205.52s)]
*  and people can clip this out and shove it in my face for the rest of my life. And far more aggregate [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1212.8s)]
*  this every day. This right now, I really think this is the greatest thing they ever could have done [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1218.0800000000002s)]
*  for him. For professionally, career wise. Oh yeah. Motivation wise. This is the all time. We did you [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1222.88s)]
*  a favor by doing this trade. They're like, I already thought he was going to win a title someday. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1230.8s)]
*  To me, he was the natural pick of anyone under 27 for who was going to win. All of the checkpoints [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1235.9199999999998s)]
*  that he's hit as a player. But the one thing that was kind of missing was like, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1242.08s)]
*  guys carrying too much weight. Like he, you know, if you go back and you watch him rookie year, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1247.44s)]
*  second year, he's just way skinnier and he's more explosive, right? He had all this weight because [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1253.52s)]
*  it made him harder to deal with. It made him more physical. It added a post-up game. But [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1257.92s)]
*  you know, now I wonder what between that, some of the stuff we're already reading about LeBron [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1262.72s)]
*  and him kind of Luca and all watching LeBron's workout. I mean, LeBron's like one of the most [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1268.96s)]
*  legendary workout guys ever. And Luca kind of maybe finally understanding this is maybe what it takes. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1273.52s)]
*  Usually this happens when somebody's on the U S Olympic team, but Lucas Slovenian, like he was, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1281.68s)]
*  he never was in that. William was like, and you always have these stories like that. It's [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1287.2s)]
*  92 had it, 2008 had it where they're watching the best player and they're like, holy shit, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1291.28s)]
*  that guy's getting up at 5 30 in the morning to work out. Maybe I should start doing that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1296.72s)]
*  And so anyway, I just feel like that's the frustrating thing for me as a Laker hater. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1300.72s)]
*  That this is just clearly the greatest thing. Plus everyone comes to California and loses 20 [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1306.24s)]
*  pounds is the other, other thing. So he said, that's just actually gonna happen anyway. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1310.56s)]
*  Well, no, I agree. And sometimes the psychology with players is like deceptively simple. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1313.92s)]
*  We're talking about my homes, you know, what he's going to think about all year. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1319.92s)]
*  Yeah. And every time there's a clip on ESPN, look at that, look at that Brady, you know, fed off that [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1323.28s)]
*  his entire career. So just imagine Luca read all those stories about being overweight team. Didn't [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1329.84s)]
*  believe in me. They thought his Achilles was going to explode. That was my favorite one in the last [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1334.96s)]
*  week. Ah, it's Achilles. It's a ticket time bomb. Oh, okay. Cool. Um, how can you just last thing, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1340.48s)]
*  can you walk us through how this plays out in Dallas with your, um, lifelong knowledge, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1347.2s)]
*  appreciation, historical sense of things in Dallas, a trade that was being compared to the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1354.4s)]
*  JFK assassination for its impact on the city. How does it play out from, uh, an animosity, anger, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1360.32s)]
*  um, just what are the next four months look like? So here's what I would say. The Mavericks were [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1369.52s)]
*  created as a franchise in my lifetime. Like they were, they were literally 1981. Yeah. So, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1374.08s)]
*  and 1980, sorry to watch them. You had other than that time, they pushed the Lakers to seven games [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1381.2s)]
*  in the Western conference finals until the dirt gear. They were just barely a franchise, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1387.76s)]
*  barely a franchise, barely rated on the Dallas sports consciousness, way behind the Rangers, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1392.64s)]
*  uh, you know, for second place, by the way, it felt like in the nineties, they were like an actual, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1399.6000000000001s)]
*  they were one of the NBA train wreck franchises. Absolutely. I mean, it was one of those, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1404.8000000000002s)]
*  people still said Clippers, but it was actually the Mavericks, except the Mavericks would just [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1409.92s)]
*  lose the draft lottery every year. Remember that they gave that 76 years, all time wins record, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1413.68s)]
*  a ride a couple of times. I mean, it was just unbelievably bad. And I remember when they traded [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1419.12s)]
*  Jason kid too, it totally made sense. Cause it was like, of course they did. They're stupid. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1423.76s)]
*  Of course they're going to trade him after two years. Oh my God. Was that Sam Cassell and, uh, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  yeah, whatever. I was like, yeah, we're not sure these three guys can mesh together. So we're [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1432.08s)]
*  going to trade the best one of the three. It was like, you guys are idiots. Totally. And Cuban and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  dirt made the Mavericks into a real franchise. Yeah. And then there was another period of, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1440.32s)]
*  you know, kind of weirdness there at the end where they kind of went, you know, they were declining [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1444.9599999999998s)]
*  with Dirk and then Luca made them again, like no matter what you say, Lucas here, there's a thing [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1448.24s)]
*  to talk about. There's a thing to pay attention to. There's a reason to buy a ticket to a Mavericks [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1453.52s)]
*  game and be excited and get into the Mavericks. And now I just wonder where they slide, you know, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1457.28s)]
*  on the sports consciousness and even talk to those radio hosts, the same thing. It's like, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1463.6s)]
*  what's the Maverick segment we do, you know, like, what do we do? Do we do an AD segments every week? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1466.88s)]
*  I don't think so. I wouldn't, you know, if they, they're, you know, let's say they get healthy and [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  they're a playoff team this year. I mean, obviously there'll be some interest people will be in, but I [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1477.84s)]
*  just think it's going to be hard. You've seen this happen with Boston teams before where you just [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1481.28s)]
*  slide off the map for a while. How about the Pats? And in this case, it's not just because you're bad [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1485.6799999999998s)]
*  or potentially bad in a couple of years. It's because people are pissed at you. Like they're angry [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1491.6s)]
*  with you. They think you just screwed them over in a way they've never felt before. And I just think [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1496.4799999999998s)]
*  there's a lot of potential there for them. Just slide into the ocean for a while. Well, I mean, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  imagine if Kyrie leaves, so he's, he can opt out. There's some pre-HD stuff with him potentially. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1506.88s)]
*  This could, this could be a house of cards pretty quickly. And then the Davis piece of it, if, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1513.84s)]
*  you know, if, if he's just not healthy this year, like they have a real chance not to make the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1519.28s)]
*  playoffs because the West is so good. I was looking at the odds, like I bet it when I was in [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1523.92s)]
*  Louisiana over the weekend, I bet on Fandall, I bet on Golden State at like plus one 55 to make [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1528.4s)]
*  the playoffs. They're plus one oh two tomorrow. They might be plus one 70. Like the West is like, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1534.8000000000002s)]
*  depending on who wins two games in a row, there's 11 good teams plus San Antonio. There's eight [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1541.2800000000002s)]
*  playoff spots. So if you have Davis out for a month combined with, you know, Kyrie pull something [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1546.16s)]
*  for a week. Now all of a sudden you're just, you're sliding out of it. So, uh, fascinating stuff. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1553.52s)]
*  Who, who thought Dallas would be this crazy as a sports, as a sports city without the Cowboys [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1559.6s)]
*  being involved? I think that might've been the biggest shocker of all of it. Oh my God. And I [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1565.76s)]
*  tell you the words Brian Schottenheimer have not been uttered once on Dallas sports. Or, or Jerry [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1569.68s)]
*  Jones possibly winning an Emmy for land man. There we go. The most emotional TV cameo of the [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1576.88s)]
*  last five years. Who knew? Best thing he's done in 30 years by far. Unbelievable stuff. Oh, I almost [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1583.5200000000002s)]
*  forgot to do this. So I was saying to you last night when we were texting that this was the first [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1589.2s)]
*  NBA trade that I felt could be turned into a Ryan Murphy limited series on Netflix, where I, listen, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  not to compare this trade to the Menendez brothers and Ted Bundy and some of the other things they've [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1603.6s)]
*  done, but why not? But it feels like, you know, you have characters, you have intrigue, you have the [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1607.84s)]
*  Dumonts coming in as like the rich family screwing stuff up. You have Cuban as the old guy hanging on. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1615.84s)]
*  You have Luca and his like, whoever his entourage is and whatever they could Ryan Murphy that [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1621.6s)]
*  character up and make me be like, no, no, Luca, it's three in the morning. You can't have Popeyes. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1627.52s)]
*  You have LeBron and Rich Paul and AD and the Lakers side and Jeannie Buss and Jay Moore. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1631.28s)]
*  Somebody could maybe Jay Moore plays himself. Anyway, I asked you to just go nuts with this. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1639.44s)]
*  Yeah. So opening scene of our limited series, it's gotta be this coffee shop meeting between Nico and Rob Malinka. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1644.3999999999999s)]
*  On January 7th, immortalized by a photo from some random weirdo in Dallas. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1651.44s)]
*  And did you hear the guy taking the photo was a Lakers fan. So he recognizes Palinka, but he doesn't [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1656.88s)]
*  recognize Nico. Oh, which is a great detail. So he snaps a photo. We see Bill camera push in. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1662.64s)]
*  He's texting a friend and he goes, I just found Rob Palinka having coffee with some guy, which really [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1670.48s)]
*  opening credits. Boom. Let's go. Yeah. Theme song, hard cut. Here we go. Ryan Murphy's Luca trade. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1676.64s)]
*  And the only drawback there is do we want Palinka to walk away from the coffee meeting and pick up [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1683.84s)]
*  the phone and call somebody and be like, you'll never believe this. Right. You'll never believe [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1688.0s)]
*  what I just heard. We got this going on. Mark Cuban flashback. Yeah. Yelling at the refs, buying the team, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1693.1999999999998s)]
*  selling the team. Oh yeah. Kobe flashback. So we can see Palinka and Nico meeting [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1702.08s)]
*  probably at Lakers games, right? Talking to each other. So we're going back and forth like the last [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1709.6799999999998s)]
*  dance a little bit. Okay. Yeah. Well, yeah. This is a limited series, right? We got to have no, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1713.52s)]
*  not everything has flashbacks these days. Right. I was playing with some casting here too. You got [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1717.36s)]
*  to help me with this. I mean, I'm just so sorry we lost Penny Marshall because Maryam Adelson. I mean, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1722.16s)]
*  that would have been the ultimate casting. Maybe we can bring her back. CGI now is amazing. Maybe [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1726.72s)]
*  Penny Marshall's not, maybe it's not dead yet. CGI Penny Marshall. Do we want Josh Gad for Patrick [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1732.16s)]
*  Dumont? I kind of like that a little bit. Oh, that's really good. I mean, you could also go Chris Pratt [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1737.92s)]
*  putting the weight back on after losing the weight and getting muscular the last 12 years. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1743.12s)]
*  Now he's going back trying to win an Emmy. Who do we like for Cuban? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1748.32s)]
*  Cubans like, uh, I it's, it, it feels like Jeremy strong and a zag. Nobody expecting [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1754.32s)]
*  Jeremy strong here. It's got the Cuban wing on. He's super personable. And you're like, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  Whoa, Jeremy strong is Cuban. This is crazy. Why are they doing this? He could be Palinka too. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1766.4799999999998s)]
*  That's because what if he's reading the alchemist wife? No, Rob Lowe has to be [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1772.48s)]
*  Planko. What are you talking about? Okay. But they have to be quoting, you know, from things and [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1776.48s)]
*  doing, yeah, either one of those guys I could see actually. Who else could be Cuban? I had J.K. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  Ben Affleck. Could Ben Affleck be Cuban? I had J.K. Simmons with a wig and, and it was like, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1786.1599999999999s)]
*  I was like, he's too old, but he's actually only four years older than Cuban. Just, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1793.76s)]
*  no, that's great. I like that. The faces look different, but we, we can, we can work on that. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1797.1999999999998s)]
*  So J.K. Simmons, Nico Harrison could be 40 people. That's anybody played Danny [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1801.44s)]
*  age getting a wind of this deal, like with 30 minutes to go. He plays himself. Okay. Danny, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1807.04s)]
*  we're going to cast Danny. Dirk was a tough one for me. Dirk plays himself. Okay. Luca. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1812.3200000000002s)]
*  Actually, you could also do the thing with Dirk where it's like a six, four actor with a bad [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1818.72s)]
*  Dirk wig. And it's clearly not dirt. Cause that's one of the staples of these shows where the guy [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1822.64s)]
*  doesn't actually follow sports. Yeah. Somebody has to be completely ridiculous. Yeah. That's, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1826.8s)]
*  that's probably dirt. Dirk's like six, two. What do we do with Luca? Luca's tough. This is where [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1831.52s)]
*  you get into like the, uh, the Aaron Hernandez show, which I liked and the guy didn't really [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1837.76s)]
*  look like Aaron Hernandez, but by the end of the show, you kind of felt like he was Aaron [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1843.04s)]
*  Hernandez. So you almost need, you need somebody that's big and a little doughy and that could be [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1847.52s)]
*  anybody. Maybe you're going with an unknown for that one. Yeah. Do we need like a De Niro style [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1852.08s)]
*  weight gain where we send them to Italy to eat pasta for like three months so they can be Luca? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1856.08s)]
*  Too expensive in the budget. You have to pretend Italy, you have to pretend it's like Palos Verde. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  I like, this is actually a good series. Yeah, this is pretty good. And it's, I think the Dumont, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1868.1599999999999s)]
*  the, the Adelson Dumont family, I think features prominently in this. Yeah. Just like you really [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1874.56s)]
*  make Dumont like a villain and just a goofball who's like trying frantically trying to read up [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1881.52s)]
*  on NBA history. Like he's reading Halberstam, breaks to the game. Somebody told me to read this. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1887.6s)]
*  I don't know who any of these people are. It's just confused. Can we still get Bill Walton in a trade? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1891.76s)]
*  Who's playing skin and who are the Mavs radio guys? What are those guys? You're talking about Ben and [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1897.6s)]
*  skin. Yeah. Ben and skin. Who's playing Ben and skin? Oh my God. Those are great roles. I would [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1904.48s)]
*  have so many ideas for Maverick sports radio. I mean, there'd be so many, this would be unbelievable. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1909.6s)]
*  Could people play me and, and Rosilla and Mahoney doing the reaction pot or are we playing ourselves? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1913.76s)]
*  Yeah. And skip plays himself too. Don't forget that. Cause he would have some big takes on this. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  Skip with like some de-aging, like the Irishman. Cause we go back into the mid 2000s when he's [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1922.3999999999999s)]
*  saying that you can't win a title with Dirk DeWittsky. Then it's like current skip. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1928.32s)]
*  Steven A, Steven A actor or Steven A is himself. He absolutely wants to play himself. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1933.6799999999998s)]
*  What about Donald Faison as Nico Harrison? Interesting. See that'd be good. Yeah. All [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1939.1999999999998s)]
*  right. This is great. Ryan Murphy, get on it. Call us. We're, we're ready to do this. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO8kUwddhQ&t=1945.28s)]
