# Are Ant Edwards and the Wolves About to Blow Up the NBA’s Hierarchy? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU)
*  The next Minnesota Denver game isn't until Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=0.0s)]
*  Minnesota took a two nothing lead over Denver. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=3.12s)]
*  And there was a moment like around the second quarter in that game when it was [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=6.32s)]
*  just clear that this was now clubber Lang in the first fight against Rocky, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=9.72s)]
*  where you just like, Oh my God, they can't, they can't hold these guys off. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=14.64s)]
*  We talked about a little on the Sunday pod with Brasilo about what if they're [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=19.44s)]
*  just ready now, what like we've seen this over the course of NBA history. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes teams are just ready and we never expect it, but they're ready to go. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=27.96s)]
*  And, and then we all look at each other and we can't believe it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  And then it happens in this case, it's happening. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=34.68s)]
*  So my question, if you remember once upon a time, I did a whole chapter [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=38.04s)]
*  about what ifs on my book of basketball. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=41.92s)]
*  I did the 33 biggest what ifs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  I got to do that again, because there's probably more what ifs now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=45.28s)]
*  I have Kevin Durant's involved, but at least four of them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=47.88s)]
*  What if Minnesota sweeps? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=51.56s)]
*  What if they sweep Denver just as a thought exercise? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=53.44s)]
*  What are all the ramifications of that? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=58.04s)]
*  We leave the weekend. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=59.92s)]
*  I think they play on Sunday and we're still on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=61.8s)]
*  I are talking about a Minnesota sweep. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=65.2s)]
*  What are, what are the outputs of this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=67.72s)]
*  Well, here's the biggest one. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=70.0s)]
*  Anthony Edwards becoming the king of the NBA is officially in play. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=73.04s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=77.76s)]
*  Well, he's averaging a 32 and the seven and six and over and over again, is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=79.8s)]
*  just making these crazy supernatural plays. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=84.48s)]
*  I was talking to a friend of mine today on the phone about it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=86.84s)]
*  The game sped up on Yoke Edge. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=90.12s)]
*  Those two game one and game two, Minnesota was able to speed it up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=91.76s)]
*  And he was playing at this weird pace that we've a little frantic, like he [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=94.48s)]
*  just kind of couldn't, couldn't grab control of the horse and the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=98.08s)]
*  opposite happened for Edwards. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  Edwards, it looks like everything's slowing down. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=104.56s)]
*  He's starting to look like Bradley Cooper and limitless. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  I was watching limitless over the weekend. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=108.92s)]
*  And there's that moment at the end when he's talking to De Niro and De Niro's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  like, you're going to fuck with me. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=115.0s)]
*  I'll come right at you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=116.08s)]
*  And Bradley Cooper's like, do you understand what's happening right now? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=117.0s)]
*  There's going to be a car accident right over there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=119.52s)]
*  Watch this guy's going to be looking at his phone. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=121.08s)]
*  Car accident happens. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=123.2s)]
*  Everything has slowed down for Edwards. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=125.64s)]
*  Shit's going on. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=127.52s)]
*  All of a sudden he has this mid nineties turnaround Michael Jordan shot that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=128.72s)]
*  Jordan took years and years and years to craft and perfect. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=134.4s)]
*  I'm not comparing to Michael Jordan. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=138.44s)]
*  I'm just saying all of a sudden he has this bankable turnaround shot where he [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=140.2s)]
*  can physically push down, get to the spot that he wants, and then just easily [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=143.8s)]
*  shoot over basically anybody they put on him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=147.96s)]
*  Aaron Gordon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=150.84s)]
*  Cool. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=151.4s)]
*  I'm just going to go by you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Everything slowed down for this dude. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  So, all right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=156.84s)]
*  What if he goes through Katie and Booker in round one? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  What if he goes through the defending champs and Yoko Jamuri in round two, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  next round, Luca or SJ they're going to be favored in that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  And then Tatum and Brown in the last round. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  I've already watched him go head to head with those guys and he couldn't be less [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=171.0s)]
*  scared of them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=174.28s)]
*  What if they win the title and he runs through all those dudes and wins finals [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  MVP? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  Like this is on. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  Here's what else is going to happen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=182.52s)]
*  Team USA late July. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, this now turns into a 92 Michael Jordan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=186.36s)]
*  Hey, I know you love all these old guys, but I'm also here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  We he's in the Netflix series. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=193.44s)]
*  Netflix is doing that NBA show that's basically modeled after quarterbacks. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  I think LeBron's in it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=198.76s)]
*  Jimmy Butler Tatum's in it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Anthony Edwards is in it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=201.88s)]
*  Um, from what I've heard, he is very, very, very loving of all the cameras and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  all the attention and all the different stuff that comes with that series. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=209.92s)]
*  And, uh, they're predicting he might be the star of the series. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  Not surprising if you watched hustle with Adam Sandler, when he stole every [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  scene he was in and hustle. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  So you have that endorsements, sneakers, commercials, hosting, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  SNL, all that stuff becomes in play. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=228.44s)]
*  And then, um, just like the future of the league, again, this is a thought [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=231.28s)]
*  exercise. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=237.96s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not overreacting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=238.88s)]
*  I'm not prisoner of moment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=240.16s)]
*  I'm just saying, what if he sweeps Denver and then it keeps going. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=241.16s)]
*  We went from Jordan dead spot, Kobe and Shaq. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=245.16s)]
*  They showed up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=250.8s)]
*  Great. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=251.28s)]
*  Hey, Hey guys. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=251.68s)]
*  Then it eventually became Kobe and LeBron little Wade mixed in there for a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=253.16s)]
*  split second turned into LeBron and Curry. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=257.0s)]
*  And now we're hitting the tail end of LeBron and Curry. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=260.52s)]
*  It feels like, and we're all looking around going, well, who's, is it just [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=263.04s)]
*  going to be foreign dudes that are running the league? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=267.44s)]
*  It's going to be Janice and Jokic and Luca. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=269.12s)]
*  What are we going to have an American guy under 30 take the reins here? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=272.12s)]
*  And then aunt comes in and he's like, I am doing a Michael Jordan impersonation [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=275.96s)]
*  for, um, the entire playoffs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=280.36s)]
*  How about that? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=282.52s)]
*  Will that do it for you? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=283.12s)]
*  I'm the most charismatic, fun guy the league's had in God knows how long. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, is that enough for you? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  Um, so there's that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=290.28s)]
*  He even squashed the MJ goat thing already. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  He was like, don't compare me to him. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=296.76s)]
*  He's the greatest player of all time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=298.24s)]
*  I don't want to, that's not fair to me or him. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=299.68s)]
*  Don't compare to me. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  He had that quote, which also was a weird way to get on the board with [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  the MJ LeBron go conversation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=306.12s)]
*  Where he's like, Michael Jordan is clearly the best player of all time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  I can't wait to see how LeBron reconciles that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=310.44s)]
*  The point is that the biggest what if outcome of a Denver sweep, if they pull [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=313.44s)]
*  this off is aunt becoming the king of the NBA world is in play. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=318.88s)]
*  There's more stuff I have for you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  Minnesota, they become the title favorites, regardless of what the odds say. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=326.68s)]
*  Right now in Fando, Boston's even money plus 100 to win the title. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=331.16s)]
*  Minnesota is plus 290. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=336.44s)]
*  See is plus 750. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=336.76s)]
*  Denver's 50 to one. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  The odds are better for Boston because there's more risk against Fando and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=338.84s)]
*  whoever's taking those bets on Boston in the Minnesota, the odds drop. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  But to me, Minnesota becomes the favorite in that series because of the way they're [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  playing, the way they're playing defense, uh, the poor Zingas question. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  If you're giving me poor Zingas in the Minnesota series, I'm more interested. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  Now I think Boston with game seven at home, but right now with me not knowing [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  what's going to happen with poor Zingas, Minnesota has to be favored in that series. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=361.2s)]
*  Here's another thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=365.28s)]
*  Here's another thing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  Man, this one, I had to break out another stupid pyramid for you guys. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=369.2s)]
*  I was thinking about the best defensive teams I've ever seen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=374.68s)]
*  Um, since the ABA MBA merger, which was the 76, 77 season underrated Blazers [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  year there further away. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=384.08s)]
*  If you're talking about the defensive teams, but, um, the best defensive [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=385.2s)]
*  team I've ever seen in playoffs have to matter. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=390.88s)]
*  Don't get me like, oh, the 2016 spurs, the regular season defensive rating. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=394.08s)]
*  I'm talking like when the fucking money's on the table, what defense do you want? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=398.16s)]
*  And it's down to the Oh four pistons and the 89 pistons. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=403.36s)]
*  Those are the two best defensive teams I've ever seen since I've been watching [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=406.4s)]
*  basketball. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=409.84s)]
*  I wasn't old enough to see bill Russell. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=410.48s)]
*  And by the way, if we're doing best defensive teams of all time, it starts [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=412.44s)]
*  with pick nine bill Russell teams. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=416.64s)]
*  The 70 Knicks are probably in there somewhere, and then it's all the modern [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=419.84s)]
*  teams, but Russell and whoever is the best defensive team of all time. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=423.0s)]
*  I'm going to go with the Oh four pistons because, um, a couple of things were [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=427.6s)]
*  going on there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=432.28s)]
*  One, the rules were in their favor. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=432.8s)]
*  I'm going to talk with Ethan Sherwood Strauss later about how the rules changed [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=434.0s)]
*  in Oh four and that is 2024 is a little similar. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=436.92s)]
*  Um, Ben Wallace, Rashid Wallace, those dudes together and Rashid Wallace [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=440.64s)]
*  really giving a shit. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=446.92s)]
*  So you're protecting the rim. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=448.24s)]
*  You can switch on anyone. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=449.84s)]
*  They were probably the two best defensive bigs in the league. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=451.56s)]
*  Duncan's probably two beat or Rashid two a at that point. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=454.0s)]
*  Um, Tayshaun Prince shut down guy on the sides and then the Billups [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=457.56s)]
*  Hamilton back court, plus the way they play it together. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  And they just rip through the playoffs and we still didn't totally believe [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  there are five to one underdogs in the finals, which was ridiculous. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  And they ended Kobe and Shaq. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  It was done. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=476.48s)]
*  They finished them. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=477.68s)]
*  So I think about the Oh four Pistons. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=479.08s)]
*  It's not just how unbelievable it was to watch them very similar to basically [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=481.96s)]
*  what we're watching in this Minnesota Denver and what we watched with some of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=486.12s)]
*  the Minnesota Phoenix stuff, where it just feels like they have eight guys, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=489.04s)]
*  but there's only five. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=493.16s)]
*  They can protect everything. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=494.4s)]
*  They're just, they're, they're able to change the flow of a game and the pace [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=495.36s)]
*  and just teams are on their heels. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=499.56s)]
*  Kobe was so bad in that final series. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=501.4s)]
*  It's it was like shocking. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=503.44s)]
*  We couldn't believe it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=505.44s)]
*  It was, this was Kobe at the basically peak of his athletic powers. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  Like even by the time he got to 2006, I don't think he was as unbelievable as [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=511.36s)]
*  an athlete as he was in that Oh one, no four stretch, but, um, that's the best [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=515.08s)]
*  defensive team I've ever seen. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=519.2s)]
*  The 89 Pistons are second. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=520.8s)]
*  When I did my book, I think I had them as the fourth best team of all time. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=522.72s)]
*  And it was partly because they were so malleable with their lineup, but you [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=526.44s)]
*  know, they had Rodman who's whatever shortlist you want to make for the best [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=529.96s)]
*  defensive players ever he's on it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=533.88s)]
*  Uh, they had Joe Dumars. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=535.88s)]
*  They had, um, they had the collective, you know, John Sally, they had all these [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=538.2s)]
*  different, you want to go small ball. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=543.6s)]
*  We can do that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=544.76s)]
*  If you, if you're going to play three guards against us, we can guard that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=545.84s)]
*  They just were the Swiss army and I have defensive team and their physicals fuck. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=549.04s)]
*  And they just want to beat the shit out of you. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=553.56s)]
*  Impossible to play against. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=556.56s)]
*  I have them second. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=557.84s)]
*  And I think the number three spot right now, I would have for the 91 bulls who [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=559.0799999999999s)]
*  go back and look at the stats for that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=565.64s)]
*  I think the points allowed that season for them in the playoffs was like eight [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=567.16s)]
*  or nine points lower than everybody else. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=572.16s)]
*  MJ at his athletic peak, Pippen really coming together as one of the most [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=574.24s)]
*  important defensive players in the history of the league and they throw [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  Pippen on MJ and the series changes. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  Horace grants in there. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=585.9599999999999s)]
*  That team was just loaded. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=586.92s)]
*  I would have them in the three spot, but I think the T Wolf's have a chance to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  take it, which is why I mentioned this. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=591.48s)]
*  So if I'm doing a pyramid, Oh, four pistons top, the next spot would be the 89 [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=593.4000000000001s)]
*  pistons and the 91 bulls next spot. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  The third level would be the 99 spurs, which I'm always going to be partial to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=603.88s)]
*  it because it was the one time they got Robinson and Duncan together, the twin [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=609.1600000000001s)]
*  towers where they're just like, you just weren't, you're not getting in the rim [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=612.84s)]
*  on these guys, it's not happening. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=616.96s)]
*  It's never happening. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=618.24s)]
*  Collectively. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=618.92s)]
*  That team was just a nightmare. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=619.52s)]
*  Then you have the 96 bulls, which was the older wiser version of the 91 bulls. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=621.16s)]
*  I made a rule that it had to be at least five years between teams. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=625.76s)]
*  So like you couldn't do the 89 pistons and the 90 pistons. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=628.76s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=631.44s)]
*  They're basically the same team. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=631.92s)]
*  96 bulls you're adding Rodman, older wiser MJ Pippen. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=633.16s)]
*  And by that time I wrote about that, that in my book about how those guys, it [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=637.44s)]
*  was like, MJ had just trained his shadow defensively in Pippen and those guys, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=641.8s)]
*  the way they moved was unbelievable to watch. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=647.12s)]
*  So I would put the 24 T Wolves pretty close to that third tier at this point. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=649.68s)]
*  The last tier is Oh, eight Celtics who were awesome regular season defensive [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=655.96s)]
*  team and then playoffs a little more hit or miss, especially when they went [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=661.84s)]
*  smaller lineups, the 92 Knicks were incredible. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  They ended up losing in round two to MJ and seven, but they, man, they just [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=670.2s)]
*  like basically took the piston stug ball and they went to a whole other level [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=673.48s)]
*  with it and turned every game in a rugby match, Oh, three Pacers with our test [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=677.28s)]
*  and Germaine O'Neal and just the rules were really good. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=682.16s)]
*  And then the Oh five spurs, I had to have a spurs team from that era with Duncan [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  and Bruce Bowen and Manu and all those guys. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=689.96s)]
*  And I think it would probably be the Oh five spurs. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=692.0s)]
*  The point is that if the T Wolves sweep the nuggets and they're able to beat [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  Yoke edge, the way they're beating them at the three spots in play for me, it [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=701.24s)]
*  really is, it's that between them and the 91 Bulls for the best defensive teams [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  I've ever seen in my life. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=710.12s)]
*  Like the size they have, this is another outcome. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=711.16s)]
*  The Jada McDaniels who has not only would you call them one of the best [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=714.16s)]
*  perimeter defensive players in the league. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=720.4s)]
*  Now he's starting to be like, wow, where does this guy rank for best [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=721.8s)]
*  premier players we've seen in the last like 10 to 12 years? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=725.76s)]
*  Just an absolute shutdown. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=729.0s)]
*  It's like having the ultimate shutdown corner and football or something. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=731.16s)]
*  Um, and then the size of go bear in towns and Nas read who's so crucial [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  against the Oak edge and then Edwards who we talked about earlier, but. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=739.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, the defense is, is one of the things that makes him so special. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=745.12s)]
*  This was the thing Colby always had from basically like 99, 2000, 2001, as he [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=748.44s)]
*  was trying to figure out who he was offensively, he was trying to figure [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=754.24s)]
*  out how to play with Shaq, but the defense where it was like, man, this [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=756.5999999999999s)]
*  guy's going to make some all defensive teams and especially in the playoffs, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=761.3199999999999s)]
*  he, he could just lock people down. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=764.4799999999999s)]
*  And Edwards has that too, the competitiveness, the ability to go both ways. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=766.68s)]
*  They never seem tired. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=770.88s)]
*  Uh, the difference is Edwards physically is just way stronger than Colby was. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=772.52s)]
*  Kobe, you go back and you look at those early Kobe ears and he's just thinner. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  And, um, just look at 06, 08, 09, he's just kind of filled out and stronger [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=781.1600000000001s)]
*  and he can take contact in different ways. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  The guys in the guy in those early years was just this pretty skinny, amazing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=792.1600000000001s)]
*  athlete who was competitive as shit. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=797.08s)]
*  Edwards is already built like he could walk on a football field and run for 1500 [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=798.88s)]
*  yards, uh, another outcome, the go bear trade much ridiculed on [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=803.72s)]
*  this podcast goes from being one of the craziest trades ever made. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=811.0s)]
*  And I still, by the way, feel like it's one of the craziest trades ever made. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=814.68s)]
*  To an incredible look ahead moment by Tim Connolly, because I thought, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=818.08s)]
*  look, I went on the record. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=821.64s)]
*  I thought what they gave away was insane. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=822.84s)]
*  I thought they gave 210 cents on the dollar. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=824.76s)]
*  But even if you're going to justify it, it made no sense because [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=828.6s)]
*  aunt wasn't close to being in yet. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=832.0s)]
*  It's like by the time NBA history says he's going to start peeking by the time [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=835.0s)]
*  he's 24, 25, which would be the end of this contract. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=839.72s)]
*  So you're trading for this guy in a win now mode, but the guy that you need to [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=842.72s)]
*  help you win now, is it ready yet? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=846.64s)]
*  Well, obviously Tim Connolly saw something and was like, this guy's going [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=848.96s)]
*  to be ready sooner than we thought. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=852.0s)]
*  And maybe he looked at the history of MJ and Wade and Kobe and all these dudes [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=853.32s)]
*  that age, David Thompson, all these guys age 22 to 23 and their ability to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=858.2s)]
*  potentially just be superstars out of nowhere when you're least expecting it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=863.2s)]
*  Did he see that? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=867.36s)]
*  Did he just want to have a competitive team away right away? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=868.8s)]
*  I don't know, but, um, putting go bear and the rest of the size they have behind [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=871.3199999999999s)]
*  aunt and McDaniel's turned out to be one of the shrewdest things of the decade. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=878.0s)]
*  I'll never apologize for my take on the go bear trade. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=882.12s)]
*  I gave, I think they gave away too much, but it worked. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=884.28s)]
*  Uh, another outcome, towns much maligned, you know, on a scale of Ben Simmons to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=886.8399999999999s)]
*  10 towns was probably a three, meaning negative, like just like I give up on [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=892.4s)]
*  this dude is being a winning basketball player. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=897.68s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=899.56s)]
*  I don't know if he's wired to win games correctly. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=900.12s)]
*  Uh, all the dumb fouls, like this stuff, even you saw it this year when he [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=904.0799999999999s)]
*  went for 60 in that meaningless game and his coach benched him, you know, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=907.64s)]
*  it was like, he was a classic. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=910.8s)]
*  He's never going to get a guy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=911.92s)]
*  And Edwards is so great now that he's sucked him into the greatness. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=913.8s)]
*  And this version of towns is unbelievable. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  Like the way he's playing defense against Denver, holy shit. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=918.68s)]
*  Uh, so now he's, uh, he went from a, how can you win with this dude to [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=922.52s)]
*  wow, you can win with this dude. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=928.16s)]
*  That's the thing about basketball. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=932.16s)]
*  Never, never give up on town. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=933.3599999999999s)]
*  Apparently, uh, a couple more outcomes. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=934.88s)]
*  The new rules become legendary. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  If Minnesota wins, they changed it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=939.76s)]
*  Ethan and I are going to talk about this next segment, but they [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=941.28s)]
*  changed the rules mid season. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=943.2399999999999s)]
*  It ends up being absolutely perfect for, for Minnesota specifically. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=945.0s)]
*  And leads to, um, them again, in this, what if scenario sweeping the nuggets and [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=949.52s)]
*  becoming the favorite to win the title. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=954.88s)]
*  There's a Phoenix outcome here. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=958.68s)]
*  If they, if the nuggets get swept, where maybe we have to go back and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=960.28s)]
*  reevaluate Phoenix a little bit, which Phoenix just seemed like, whoa, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=964.68s)]
*  what do they do? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=967.76s)]
*  Blow it up. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  They have no pigs. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=968.8s)]
*  This is a wrap to, eh, they won 49 games and they went against one of the, of, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=969.52s)]
*  uh, the all time hot playoff teams and a team that I'm now talking about [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=975.9599999999999s)]
*  historically as a defensive team. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=980.64s)]
*  And, you know, they didn't have a point guard. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=982.28s)]
*  They barely had a center. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=985.5999999999999s)]
*  Like maybe we should give them a little more slack because they made [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=986.64s)]
*  Denver just look as bad as Phoenix. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  So if I'm a Phoenix fan, I feel slightly better about it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=991.12s)]
*  Uh, Denver, if they get swept, they take a, a big historical hit. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=993.84s)]
*  As you know, I'm a giant Yocage fan. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=998.68s)]
*  Um, this gets tough to defend because. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1001.76s)]
*  Denver, who I think we were doing the podcast segments last year and we, Doc [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1006.76s)]
*  and I talked about it the night of the finals was like, is this team positioned [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1010.64s)]
*  now to go on a run here to win like three titles in four years, three titles in [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1013.52s)]
*  five years, um, now they're, if they got swept, they move into, yeah, they [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1017.52s)]
*  won that title, but, and they move into that group, you know, else in that group, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1024.84s)]
*  the 22 warriors, sorry, you're in it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1029.44s)]
*  You lucked out with some teams you played the 21 bucks. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1032.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1036.12s)]
*  You're in there too. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1037.2s)]
*  The 2020 Lakers bubble 2019 Raptors. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1038.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1041.72s)]
*  Katie and clay Thompson got hurt in the same series. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1042.08s)]
*  Really our last champ that wasn't polarizing in any way was the 2018 [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1045.56s)]
*  words. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1049.76s)]
*  It's very hard to leave a season 2012 heater like this too. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1050.08s)]
*  Um, where we leave the season going. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1054.16s)]
*  Yeah, that was the best team. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  No question. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1058.28s)]
*  Um, I still, there's a piece of me that feels that the 2009 Lakers, you could [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  have made a real case for Orlando in that series, but 2008 Celtics. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1064.44s)]
*  Good example. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1067.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was the best team. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1068.24s)]
*  I felt that way about Denver last year, but now it's like, ah, maybe I wonder [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1070.32s)]
*  if that's who they played. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't personally believe that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1076.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying it's now in the air. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1078.3999999999999s)]
*  And the other thing that's in the air for them is they had this big, we're [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1080.28s)]
*  smarter than everybody we're going length and young guys, and we're going to be so [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1083.36s)]
*  hard to play, but they bet on young guys and they bet on young guys the same way [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1088.28s)]
*  that the word is bet on their young guys last year and we can throw away, toss [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1091.56s)]
*  away some stuff on the bench where it's time to bet on their young guys. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1095.24s)]
*  You're betting on young guys gets what happens. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, sometimes young guys don't show up. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1100.84s)]
*  Sometimes they're up and down. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1102.6399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they're unpredictable. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1103.8s)]
*  And you think about Minnesota, some of the guys they're bringing off the bench. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1105.8s)]
*  They're like pretty experienced dudes, right? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  They have a nice blend of experience and youth that I think in this series, we're [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1111.52s)]
*  going to find out on Friday night, can Denver trust Christian Brown? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1116.52s)]
*  Can they trust Peyton Watson? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1119.76s)]
*  Cause they're going to need younger legs to fight off this crazy Minnesota buzzsaw. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1121.12s)]
*  Conversely of Minnesota wins the title. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1125.72s)]
*  And again, this is a what if exercise. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1130.24s)]
*  They sweep Denver. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1132.76s)]
*  They beat OKC or Dallas, which would mean they beat either Luca or they beat [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  Shay who's going to be second MVP. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1140.04s)]
*  And then they beat after beating the defending champs and some of the best [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1143.84s)]
*  players in the league, they go and they beat the 64 wins, Altex and Jason Tatum. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1147.2s)]
*  This becomes one of the better fuck yeah titles. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1152.76s)]
*  We've had in a while because like, I think like Dallas in 2011 is an [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1155.16s)]
*  awesome example of this, right? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1160.0s)]
*  Dirk who much malign, he just runs through everybody. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1162.0800000000002s)]
*  He runs through Kobe and he runs through Durant and they get to the finals and [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1165.96s)]
*  he runs through, uh, the, the LeBron Wade Bosch team. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1170.48s)]
*  And he's just like, just taken skeletons in every series. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1174.48s)]
*  This would be a taken skeleton series from series from Minnesota. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1178.3200000000002s)]
*  This was not a year. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1181.88s)]
*  It's like, ah, well you guys lucked out because this guy got hurt or that guy [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1182.76s)]
*  got hurt, this would be like, they're going through some fucking good teams here. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1185.52s)]
*  And, uh, and it would just be really impressive. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1189.48s)]
*  I mean, it'd be one of the more impressive titles I've seen. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1192.68s)]
*  Um, which leads me to one more outcome of here. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1195.44s)]
*  There's two different, I mentioned this a little on Sunday with Rossello, but [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1199.84s)]
*  there's two different levels of surprise NBA moments when we get to the playoffs. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1202.64s)]
*  One is the, wait, we're doing this now. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1207.52s)]
*  Um, where it's like the 2012 thunder. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1211.72s)]
*  It's like, ah, I guess they're going to make the finals now. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1214.92s)]
*  The 1977 Portland Trailblazers, same thing, 2015 Golden State 30 to one to win [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1217.48s)]
*  the title before the year, cause it's how I bet on it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1222.68s)]
*  Um, then it was like, okay, I guess they're going to beat Memphis. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1225.32s)]
*  I guess we're doing this now. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1228.76s)]
*  So Minnesota would go down that lane, but also in this Denver series. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is what I talked about, Rossello on Sunday. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I think this sweep is possible because we've seen this happen [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1238.2s)]
*  over the course of the NBA history. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1245.28s)]
*  We saw it happen with the old four pistons split with the two games in [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1246.56s)]
*  Lakers blew them out 14 spurs split the two first two of the heat blew them out. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1249.8400000000001s)]
*  Last three games weren't close 91 balls sweep the pistons. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1254.8s)]
*  And you could feel it in this second quarter of that game. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1260.4s)]
*  It wasn't just that they were beating Denver. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1262.88s)]
*  It was like, they were ending Denver, at least for this season, they were taking, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1265.2s)]
*  they were sucking the soul out of Yocage. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1269.72s)]
*  They were ruining Murray to the point that he fucking threw something on the court. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1272.04s)]
*  Um, it wasn't just they beat them. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1275.6000000000001s)]
*  They were snatching souls from them. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1278.92s)]
*  And I don't know if Denver comes back from that. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1281.04s)]
*  Um, but that's another outcome of this. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1283.68s)]
*  Now this is a part of the what if sweep thing, but if Yocage can somehow figure [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1286.04s)]
*  this out and pull them back, they're still 15 to one to win the title. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1290.08s)]
*  They, they, all the ads are saying that they can't come back from this. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1294.72s)]
*  Um, if he can somehow figure out this monster of an opponent and pull his team [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1298.44s)]
*  back, um, this would be one of the great things I've seen from a basketball [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1303.68s)]
*  player because he's just, especially with Murray, clearly not a hundred percent [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1308.48s)]
*  with the lack of a bench and how hungry and motivated Minnesota is compared to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1313.6000000000001s)]
*  Denver who won the title last year. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1316.84s)]
*  Um, to flip this series at this point would just be nuts. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1319.0s)]
*  It's the worst possible opponent for him. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1322.44s)]
*  They have a ton of size. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1324.04s)]
*  Uh, they have guards that can just pressure Murray and pressure him [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1325.6s)]
*  and pressure him and use length. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1328.96s)]
*  And it's just a nightmare for them. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1330.6399999999999s)]
*  If he could pull this out, it'd be great. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1332.56s)]
*  The flip side for him is that if they don't pull it out and they get swept, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1334.92s)]
*  this is the last outcome of the series from a what if standpoint. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1338.2s)]
*  The Yocage haters come out in full force. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1342.36s)]
*  The people that never believed even when he won three MVPs in four years, even [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1344.28s)]
*  when he won the title in a finals MVP, even when he averaged over the course [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1348.96s)]
*  of four playoffs seasons, dating back to 2021, I think he's 30, 13 and eight. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1355.72s)]
*  He's like. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1361.24s)]
*  Unequivocally one of the great offensive players in the history of the playoffs, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1363.16s)]
*  no matter how this turns out. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1366.8400000000001s)]
*  And the haters will still come out in full force and be like, see, told you, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1368.92s)]
*  who wasn't that good, man, just throw some defense at him. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1371.64s)]
*  He looked out last year with who he played. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1374.1200000000001s)]
*  He's going to get all that stuff. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1375.8000000000002s)]
*  What does that do for Yocage? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1377.8s)]
*  It's going to lab. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1380.6s)]
*  Has it become like a, I mentioned Rocky three-year-old has become now Rocky [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1381.72s)]
*  four things back in the log cabin. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1385.3999999999999s)]
*  Like now he's lifting Paul and Adrian. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1387.0s)]
*  Um, here's why this is stupid. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  Just about every great player has sucked in a playoff series or played [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1394.12s)]
*  below their level or just caught the wrong opponent at the wrong time. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1398.36s)]
*  This is part of NBA history. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1401.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's going to sound like I'm making excuses for him, but I'm not. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1403.8s)]
*  Um, a good example I mentioned earlier was Kobe in that piston series in [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1407.0s)]
*  Oh four worst possible team for him to play team was splintered. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1411.84s)]
*  It was a bad Laker season just in general. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1415.8799999999999s)]
*  22.1 points a game in the finals, 38% field goal. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1419.12s)]
*  Not great. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1424.1999999999998s)]
*  LeBron against Dallas in 2011. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1424.8799999999999s)]
*  Terrible opponent for him. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1429.48s)]
*  Sean Marion, Tyson Chandler behind him. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1430.9199999999998s)]
*  Uh, Dallas had really kind of figured out that Miami offense and the [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1433.9599999999998s)]
*  Brown got into his own head and the pressure was too much for him. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1437.4399999999998s)]
*  The season was too much for him. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1440.6799999999998s)]
*  18 points a game in the finals, 18, seven and seven from LeBron James. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1442.56s)]
*  And he finals when he's like kind of near his, his, his apex. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1446.52s)]
*  Um, it happens MJ, my guy, the greatest of all time against Orlando in 1995 [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1451.1999999999998s)]
*  comes back from baseball, guess what Orlando kind of kicked his ass. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1457.52s)]
*  I don't care what the stats say. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1460.9599999999998s)]
*  Go watch some of those games on YouTube. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1462.0s)]
*  Larry Bird, my favorite basketball player of all time against the 88 Pistons. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1464.44s)]
*  Got his ass kicked coming off the Hawks series against Dominique or the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1468.56s)]
*  duel and he beats Dominique and some of my guy Larry's going to pull this off. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1472.56s)]
*  And then, you know, what he wasn't expecting was Dennis Rodman in the next [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1475.6s)]
*  round and, uh, his body was starting to break down. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1479.16s)]
*  Same thing for Magic Johnson gets the Celtics in 84 where he just sucked. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1481.88s)]
*  Where they were calling him tragic Johnson after the finals. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1485.48s)]
*  KD against, uh, Golden State in 2016 where they're up three one. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1488.52s)]
*  They have a chance to finish it and he just doesn't play well. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh, every Will Chamberlain playoffs against Bill Russell basically, except [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1494.88s)]
*  for 1967, I could keep going and going and going and going. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1498.68s)]
*  This happens. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1502.8000000000002s)]
*  This is the wrong time, wrong opponent, wrong season for a [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1504.5600000000002s)]
*  Yocage Minnesota matchup. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1508.48s)]
*  And what I'm interested for is what they would do going forward under this [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1510.88s)]
*  what if scenario of what if Minnesota sweeps. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1514.72s)]
*  If they get swept, what does the team look like next year? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1516.8s)]
*  What are the moves? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1520.12s)]
*  What was wrong? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1521.32s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1522.28s)]
*  Because Tim Connelly built Minnesota to beat Denver. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1522.84s)]
*  Now Denver has to rebuild themselves to not only beat Minnesota, but you [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1526.44s)]
*  also have OKC coming, you have Boston in the East. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1530.96s)]
*  This is, uh, an unbelievable turn of events. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1534.28s)]
*  I bet on Minnesota. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1538.12s)]
*  I think I talked about this in the pod at 16 to one with like three weeks to go in [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1539.68s)]
*  the season, just because I felt like they had defense, they had a good coach. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1544.6s)]
*  And there was a puncher's chance. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1550.6799999999998s)]
*  Ant went up a level. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1552.3999999999999s)]
*  And then by the time the playoffs started, I was picking Phoenix against [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1554.3999999999999s)]
*  them around one, so I'm not taking a victory lap, um, because I watched [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1557.1599999999999s)]
*  Phoenix just make them look like they were a year away from being ready. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1560.76s)]
*  But Ant went up a level and here we are. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1565.32s)]
*  I think Minnesota is going to get, going to sweep Denver. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1568.48s)]
*  I think the series it's, I've been through these a few times as a fan, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1571.88s)]
*  and I think this one's done and, uh, and basketball is about to change as we know it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1576.1200000000001s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RiDL_BgcfU&t=1581.96s)]
