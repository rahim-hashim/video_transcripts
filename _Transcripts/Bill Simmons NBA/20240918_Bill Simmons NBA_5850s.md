# Biggest 2024-25 NBA Concerns With Zach Lowe  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFmw5SNQXmY)
*  My old friend Zach Lowe is here.
*  We used to work together at Grandland.
*  He is still at ESPN.
*  We like to do home and homes every once in a while.
*  I haven't talked basketball on this podcast
*  and like basically since the Olympics,
*  all of a sudden this season is within, what is it?
*  A month?
*  Media days in 13 days, Bill, as we're recording this.
*  I don't understand how it snuck up on us so fast,
*  but what's the thing you're most excited about
*  before we go negative?
*  Most excited about?
*  I think the West is just,
*  I have questions about everybody except Oklahoma City,
*  at least in the regular season.
*  I think Oklahoma City is just gonna be
*  a nasty regular season team.
*  Everybody after that,
*  like everybody has put Denver, Minnesota, Dallas,
*  in like Sharpie as two, three, four.
*  One of those teams at least is gonna be disappointing.
*  That's just the law of averages.
*  I have questions about all of them.
*  Some of these, Sacramento, what's gonna happen in there?
*  Pelicans have a weird high ceiling.
*  I don't know where the floor is.
*  Lakers, Suns.
*  I think the West,
*  someone is gonna sneak into the top four.
*  My pick would probably be Memphis,
*  but I just think the West is really fun, top to bottom.
*  I'm excited for just a better league.
*  I didn't really like the season last year.
*  The more we got some distance for it.
*  We had all these dumb injuries and disappointing teams
*  and then I just didn't think the playoffs were that good.
*  And then they kinda owe us.
*  They owe us a good season.
*  I've heard you talk about it
*  and I think I talked about it once.
*  What was the best playoff series of the entire playoff run?
*  That's the thing.
*  I mean, probably from an entertainment standpoint,
*  it was Philly, New York, right?
*  Minnesota-Demba was most dramatic,
*  but the games aren't games I would wanna watch again
*  on hardwood classics.
*  Dallas OKC was really good?
*  Dallas OKC was underrated.
*  Almost every other series,
*  minus a highlight here or there, was pretty forgettable.
*  Nick Spacers, just war of attrition.
*  Not that interesting.
*  Nick Sixers would be my pick.
*  Yeah, because then you think of all the guys
*  who were either hurt or coming back from injuries
*  or all the teams that were compromised.
*  The fact that we had a champion
*  that didn't even really play a high-intensity,
*  awesome game until the Indiana series,
*  and then they beat Indiana, and Indiana is like,
*  here we go, and Indiana was a team
*  that everybody was discounting
*  for months and months and months,
*  but I don't know, it just never got there.
*  So I feel like the O.S.,
*  I feel like the season's gonna be awesome.
*  When they left Yanis, I talked about this
*  when they left Yanis off for Christmas Day,
*  I was like, oh, here we go.
*  This is good.
*  We have so many good teams that Yanis
*  didn't even make Christmas Day.
*  But that's not what we're gonna talk about today.
*  We're gonna talk about the NBA things we're worried about.
*  Now we are-
*  The worry draft.
*  Yeah, and it doesn't even have to be a draft.
*  We can just alternate back and forth,
*  and if somebody takes somebody else's, that's fine.
*  But now that we're, we're not landing the plane
*  on opening night yet, but now we're kind of within
*  40 minutes, the flight attendant's telling us
*  to maybe get ready to hand the little TV things back.
*  Get your stuff, make sure you don't leave anything behind.
*  The number one thing you are the most worried about
*  heading into this NBA season is?
*  Yeah, I had a no-brainer number one pick for this draft.
*  You can go a few different directions,
*  but for me, it's the Milwaukee Bucks.
*  Just everything Milwaukee Bucks, top to bottom,
*  disaster season in just every possible way last year,
*  coaching higher gone bad, mid-season coaching change
*  slash podcast retirement by Doc Rivers,
*  doesn't right the ship, right?
*  Writes some things about the ship, but not the whole ship.
*  Another Yanis, another Yanis playoff injury
*  wipes out, wipes them out in the first round.
*  Middleton's injured off and on all year,
*  and Dame, just rough adjustment on all levels,
*  much rougher than we thought after the just earthquake
*  of a Drew Holiday trade that was their way of saying,
*  this other iteration of our team that won a championship,
*  it's hit the ceiling.
*  Like we can't get back to the finals with this group.
*  We need a jolt, we need a change.
*  This is it.
*  Juicy offense, bring in one of the greatest
*  point guards of all time,
*  one of the greatest shooting point guards of all time.
*  Easy chemistry with Yanis.
*  The story just writes itself.
*  The whole season is a mess.
*  Dame is even injured in the playoffs.
*  And now everyone's a year older.
*  Middleton is going into potentially the last year
*  of his deal with the player option in 25, 26.
*  Same is true of Portis.
*  Brook Lopez is going to be a free agent.
*  Gary Trent's here on the minimum.
*  I don't know how that's going to...
*  I'm optimistic about that, but he's like,
*  this could just be a way station for him.
*  Everyone's a year older.
*  The injury questions, particularly about Middleton,
*  kind of remain, and New York got better.
*  Philly won free agency.
*  Boston just rampaged to the title and brought everybody back.
*  I don't know where...
*  Cleveland locked up everybody.
*  Cleveland, Orlando, Indiana are coming from
*  the other side of the other half of the conference,
*  all on the upswing.
*  I don't know where this team fits in
*  in the Eastern Conference hierarchy.
*  I do know that only Philadelphia would be
*  in the conversation for me as team with more pressure
*  on them in the Eastern Conference,
*  because the Yanis domino is always just going to be
*  sitting there, and the team just gets older around him.
*  They haven't found a young player that's even remotely
*  interesting so far that Yanis can look at and say,
*  well, in five years, that guy's going to be awesome.
*  And I don't know how this season is going to go.
*  I have no feel for it.
*  And the GM tried to take the Pistons job,
*  or wanted to, and they ended up keeping him.
*  That part was weird.
*  They have a draft pick in the first round.
*  He ends up taking a young guy who can't help them this year.
*  I have the same concerns, but you could go glass half full
*  on them too, right?
*  Year from hell last year.
*  They trade Drew, he somehow ends up on the Celtics,
*  who become awesome.
*  They get Dame, who we find out after the season,
*  hasn't worked out in the whole summer leading up,
*  because he was so afraid to get hurt before he got traded.
*  And he comes in, he's going through a divorce,
*  and he's just terrible.
*  Middleton, kind of back and forth between
*  whether he was healthy or not.
*  Their bench was disappointing.
*  And the Yanis stuff before last season was real.
*  Like whether people want to believe it or not now,
*  they didn't know whether he was going to ask
*  for a trade or not, and that's something that happened.
*  So now you're looking at this season,
*  and it's the same kind of thing.
*  I know he committed to them, but that team's old.
*  What have you heard about Middleton's, just his body?
*  What are we looking at?
*  Did double ankle surgeries?
*  Did double ankle surgeries?
*  And the knees, and it just seems like his lower body
*  is going on him.
*  And to me, that's the biggest issue of all for them.
*  I mean, I've heard that they're,
*  I haven't checked in in a while,
*  but I haven't heard anything that he's not gonna be ready
*  to start the season or early in the season.
*  I don't think, like I said, I haven't checked in.
*  So I expect him to be okay.
*  But I have heard concerns about,
*  does he have any chance on defense anymore?
*  And this is a team that's gonna ask him
*  to guard real guys.
*  And the defensive infrastructure around Giannis and Lopez,
*  which is a great place to start any defense,
*  is not what it used to be.
*  The bench is like, Pat Conantin fell off a cliff last year.
*  I don't know what the hope is for him.
*  But look, I make the glass half full case
*  to people all the time,
*  because I just can't write off a team with Giannis
*  if Giannis can just avoid these freakish injuries
*  before the playoffs,
*  because the guy is like the freaking Terminator,
*  and Dame is still, I expect Dame to have a better season.
*  So there's like two ingredients right there.
*  Coaching stability should help.
*  I mean, the record under Doc was worse
*  than it was under Adrian Griffin,
*  but the Adrian Griffin thing was a disaster.
*  Like, it's easy to make the glass half full case.
*  I can't write a team with Giannis.
*  I just can't write them out of like,
*  they can't win the East or whatever.
*  But-
*  They also stole some minimum salary guys
*  that I didn't think we had that on our bingo card.
*  They got three guys that were gonna be able
*  to play in a playoff series for them
*  with no money whatsoever to spend.
*  Prince Trent and who else am I, who am I forgetting?
*  Prince Trent, there's a third one.
*  They got a third guy.
*  See, it was so stealth, I can't even remember who it was.
*  But my point is, as I make this glass half full case
*  to people around the league-
*  Right, Dillon Wright.
*  No one is, oh, Dillon Wright, I love Dillon Wright.
*  I'm like Dillon Wright fan number one.
*  That's a great signing.
*  But I make this case to people around the league,
*  coaches, front office people, agents.
*  No one's buying.
*  Everyone's like, they like stop me halfway through.
*  It's like someone trying to sell me,
*  like Optimum trying to get me to come back
*  and get my cable deal.
*  It's like, I don't need, I'm canceling, I'm canceling.
*  I'm out.
*  You don't have to give me the spiel.
*  I'm sorry, guy, I know you have to.
*  It's like no one's buying it.
*  And I can't, I mean, they're just,
*  I just hear they're old, this iteration isn't gonna work.
*  I'm like, oh, okay.
*  I'm stunned at the level of pessimism about the Bucks.
*  But they would top my, I don't know who you had it
*  or what entity you had in the top slot.
*  But for me, they were an easy like number one.
*  So Middleton played 33 games in 23,
*  put 55 games last year.
*  The minutes were low.
*  It's 24.327 for the last two seasons.
*  15 a game.
*  Just that it feels like he's at a different point
*  in his career.
*  Good, good playoffs.
*  Again, the glass outflow case involves Middleton
*  averaging like 25 a game in the playoffs against,
*  short series against the, not short,
*  six games against the Pacers.
*  That's all it was, but he had to do a lot
*  and he was pretty good.
*  But this is a team, he's 33 this year,
*  and this is a team when they go against younger wings.
*  You're just terrified for them.
*  And Giannis is doing everything.
*  But like, let's say they're super disappointing.
*  Let's say that we're in, we're heading around Christmas,
*  they're not gonna be in the Christmas games
*  and they're like one or two games over 500.
*  What, like what's, what if,
*  is the fear that Giannis would be like,
*  I don't wanna go down like this.
*  I'm still in my prime.
*  You guys need to fix this or send me somewhere?
*  Like I don't even know what the moves are.
*  I guess they have a lot of expiring deals.
*  So then they, you're in the mode
*  where you have to take a big swing for,
*  you know, somebody else's problem that's expensive.
*  And then that goes down a whole other rabbit hole
*  where you're like, oh, we didn't even really wanna do this,
*  but now we don't really have a choice.
*  And we've seen so many teams
*  fuck themselves up long-term with that.
*  I just don't know what the outcome is
*  if they don't do well, that doesn't involve Giannis rumors.
*  Yeah, I mean, Giannis is locked up,
*  ironclad through 26, 27.
*  So this season and two more, which is great for the Bucks.
*  That extension was a coup.
*  It's one of the reasons why I still defend,
*  I'm like the last person defending
*  the Damien Lollard trade apparently today.
*  You're defending it, wow.
*  Wait, is there even one more person
*  for the support group or no?
*  It's just you?
*  You're just showing up at a coffee shop by yourself?
*  It's just, it's just me.
*  There's maybe a chat room with some anonymous people
*  who are afraid to reveal their identities
*  because they're ashamed, but it's mostly just me.
*  And I still defend it because I do think offensively
*  that team was what had maxed out.
*  I thought it was worth a shot.
*  The price was pretty high and Drew Holiday.
*  Can you defend the part that Drew Holiday
*  ended up at the Celtics when you're in the chat rooms?
*  I've said before, I would love to know
*  not what they knew, but how hard they tried
*  to make it a three team trade at the time
*  that it was happening.
*  Yeah, you can't trust anything.
*  So that they could just say anywhere but Boston.
*  Anywhere but Boston.
*  The only way to do that is if the Quippers
*  had been involved in that trade from minute one
*  and then you just, you know he's going to a team
*  that's gonna keep him.
*  But I think they were, Drew was kind of blindsided by it.
*  I mean, he's talked about it.
*  I think they were so worried it was gonna come out
*  that Drew was even in the trade that they were just like,
*  you know what, we're just gonna do the trade
*  and then Portland and then hopefully.
*  It felt like they'd misread.
*  I had heard they felt like he was going to the Clippers
*  and they didn't see the Celtics piece coming,
*  which I think is crazy that they didn't see that coming.
*  I mean, everybody knew the Celtics
*  were gonna get in it, right?
*  As soon as the Drew sweeps started.
*  Especially with the agents.
*  But it just, you didn't even, it was just common sense.
*  The Clippers were definitely in it.
*  I think the Heat tried to be in it,
*  but the Heat-Laser relationship was, let's say,
*  not at a strong point at that moment.
*  But to your point, it's still not good.
*  And to your point, if they are, if it is looking like,
*  all right, you know what, it's just not happening.
*  Giannis is locked up.
*  But I don't even know what the move is
*  because Middleton is.
*  By the way, nobody is locked up anymore.
*  If Giannis wants to get traded, he's gonna get traded.
*  And that's what the league is now.
*  If he decides, I don't like this situation, that's it.
*  This is how the league goes.
*  That's largely true.
*  You at least have the leverage of years and time
*  on your side, in any case where the guy has that many years.
*  But Middleton's essentially an expiring contract.
*  Lopez is basically an expiring contract.
*  The move would be Dame.
*  And I've said before, I'll bet you Miami
*  would revisit that, the failed Dame talks before.
*  But that's, what am I getting back
*  that makes Giannis happy, if that's my concern.
*  Now, if he comes to me and says,
*  I mean, if I'm here for the long haul,
*  you need to recoup some draft picks, you get Tyler Hero,
*  whatever fake Dame trade return you wanna speculate about.
*  I'm cool, that's one thing.
*  But it's a tough, they can't compete with other teams
*  for a big name player that comes available via trade.
*  They don't have the picks, they don't have the young players.
*  I don't know, this is all the reason why there would be
*  number one on my anxiety draft.
*  They are definitely, there's no scenario going into
*  the season where they can be considered to be one
*  of the top three teams in the East.
*  If you go to the Fandl odds.
*  You're just writing it up, there's no scenario where.
*  No, I'm just saying from Fandl odds,
*  Celtics for the conference are plus 155.
*  The Sixers are plus 440.
*  Now, we can talk about them later.
*  The Knicks are plus 440, and Milwaukee's seven to one.
*  So they're like firmly in the fourth spot,
*  at least from a betting odds standpoint.
*  Everyone has written them off.
*  And like.
*  Not me, I haven't written them off yet.
*  I still feel like Dame has a big comeback year in him.
*  It's very possible.
*  Last year was just a year from now from him.
*  I, at the same time, was not bullish on Dame
*  with what everybody wanted.
*  Give up on them last year,
*  because the small guards moving at a different point
*  in their career.
*  I think there's cases to be made both ways.
*  And I feel like we're gonna know in the first couple weeks
*  of the season, this is like, oh shit,
*  this looks like 1997 Dana Barros,
*  or it's like, oh, this looks like 2019 Dame again.
*  All right, so my number one pick,
*  which I thought you were gonna take,
*  and I gotta say I'm a little surprised.
*  The Denver Nuggets.
*  Ooh, they're, I mean, they're in my,
*  they're, I guess I've talked about them a lot,
*  so I don't wanna overdo it.
*  They're in my top five, I would say.
*  Not number one or number two.
*  They lose KCP, who granted, if you watch,
*  if you look at his playoff stats, it's not devastating,
*  but it was a guy who was a proven defender.
*  The Murray extension coming off his playoffs,
*  and then the Olympics,
*  and whatever is going on with him physically,
*  that makes you gulp.
*  Gordon's got an extension coming.
*  They've been passed, at least as a regular season team
*  by OKC and Dallas and Minnesota and maybe one other team.
*  This is a six year run already.
*  One title, one round three, that's it.
*  They've had zero 60 win seasons.
*  They've had the guy who's been,
*  it's either him or Jan Esfer,
*  who's the best player in the league
*  since Lebron finally dipped a little.
*  Jokic turns 30 this season.
*  And I guess my question is,
*  are we ever gonna have a great Jokic team?
*  Because this team, they won the title
*  and they had that great playoff run,
*  but they've never had a great start to finish season.
*  They've never been kick-ass great for nine months.
*  And with a guy like Jokic,
*  especially if you compare him
*  with some of the greats in history,
*  which I think for both of us,
*  he is in the top 15 of all time now,
*  it's just a little weird and a little unlucky
*  that it's never happened for him for nine straight months.
*  And the Murray thing has a huge piece of that.
*  Murray gets hurt at the worst possible time
*  and misses two post-seasons.
*  Last year was a complete fluke.
*  I don't understand what happened to them.
*  They have a 20 point lead at home in game seven
*  and just completely fall apart.
*  Fluke is maybe the wrong word.
*  Whatever that was,
*  that was one of the most unusual game sevens
*  in the history of the league.
*  And then afterwards,
*  all the stuff they're talking about is,
*  yeah, we were dead.
*  We were exhausted.
*  It's like, go look at the history of the league.
*  Teams have played four or five finals in a row.
*  People have been having 9,500 game seasons
*  for a quarter of a decade or a half of a decade.
*  The Warriors were in the finals every year
*  from 15 and 19, playing 100 a game,
*  100 games a year.
*  The huge bullseye, every building they go into,
*  they're like rock stars.
*  There's no way the Nuggets had it harder
*  than that Warriors team.
*  And I don't really know where this goes,
*  but I don't like where we are.
*  So they did go 16 and four in the playoffs
*  the year they won the title.
*  Obviously they played a couple play-in teams.
*  So you're saying never had a great year,
*  a truly great Jokic team.
*  They've never won 60 games in a season.
*  That seems impossible, but it's 100% true.
*  They've been grinders.
*  They've been up and down.
*  It's a team that, especially last year,
*  that felt like they were down 10, 15.
*  They'd come back.
*  They'd figure out how to steal games
*  in the fourth quarter, and then the playoffs,
*  that went away.
*  And I'm just nervous, because as you know,
*  Jokic, I think is, Jokic and Curry
*  are my two favorite non-Celtics.
*  And I just hope we're not on the downside of the mountain
*  with this Nuggets run already,
*  because they don't have a lot of moves.
*  It's the Porter move is the one,
*  the Porter move's the one kind of big move they can make.
*  Other than that, I don't know what the moves are.
*  Well, the Porter thing becomes interesting
*  if and when Gordon gets an extension,
*  because then the team is just gonna become
*  so prohibitively expensive,
*  because then you get into Christian Brown's deal comes up,
*  and Peyton Watson's deal comes up,
*  and are all these guys still on the team,
*  something is gonna have to give,
*  because the Cronkies just aren't gonna pay
*  like 30 million over the second April,
*  whatever it's gonna be, 30 million over the tax
*  every single year.
*  But I don't, you talk to people around the league
*  about Michael Porter Jr. and his injury,
*  kind of lit one of those seasons on fire.
*  He and Murray lost the season together,
*  lost the postseason together.
*  People don't quite know how to value him,
*  because the on-ball aspects of his offense
*  just haven't really developed at the same,
*  at the rate that people had hoped.
*  He's on offense, he'll give an offensive rebound,
*  he's a good cutter,
*  but he's not doing all that much off the dribble,
*  so he's in this perfect ecosystem for him,
*  where he has the greatest passing big man,
*  and one of the five greatest passers-of-all time probably,
*  and this offense that's built around movement,
*  it's absolutely perfect for him.
*  Nobody really knows how that would translate.
*  His defense is average on good nights,
*  worse on bad.
*  He's got size, which helps him for whatever
*  thing they're trying to build.
*  He's a very tall shooter,
*  which tends to age really, really well,
*  but he's not like the tall shooter
*  in the classic Durant Dirk mold,
*  where it's like just give him the ball at the nail,
*  let him work, he rises up,
*  that's just the fail safe.
*  I think the Denver one is a great pick.
*  They're relying on youth.
*  I wrote about this a couple months ago.
*  They were dead last in three point rate last season,
*  three point attempt rate.
*  They lose a good three point shooter in KCP.
*  They elevate a mediocre three point shooter
*  in Christian Brown.
*  They signed the worst high volume three point shooter
*  in the history of the NBA in Russell Westbrook.
*  Like they're-
*  Didn't mention him.
*  I intentionally left him out of my case.
*  But there is a line somewhere where you just have to take
*  more threes than this,
*  or else you can't win four playoffs series in a row
*  in 2025.
*  The math is too difficult.
*  There's one other issue with that,
*  and we didn't even talk about Murray yet.
*  The more miles they put on Jokic in these seasons,
*  his three point shot starts to go sideways, right?
*  And that's what happened in Minnesota.
*  That's even, he carried over to the Olympics.
*  Teams were just like, go ahead, man, knock yourself out.
*  They were almost trying to jet out, mind trick them.
*  Well, it's by far the least,
*  it's by far the lesser of all possible evils
*  that Jokic can inflict on you.
*  Right, so in some ways it's like in the NFL
*  when there's some really good offense
*  and a quarterback that does certain things,
*  and then defenses eventually figure out,
*  all right, we'll just do this,
*  and if you make them, you make them.
*  And with the amount of miles that he had last year,
*  because they couldn't take him out.
*  I know they have some young guys they're counting on,
*  but it's just the ecosystem we have now in the league
*  where you're just not gonna have deep, awesome teams anymore
*  unless you're in this situation like the Celtics
*  where you're just gonna spend a kajillion dollars
*  for an eight man rotation.
*  So the Westbrook piece,
*  we've seen how many teams now
*  try to talk themselves into this.
*  We had Houston.
*  Washington doesn't really count
*  because they wanted him for a 40 minutes game
*  and a lot of stats.
*  The Clippers, the Lakers, this is yet another team
*  where there's a case you can make,
*  well he's gonna do this, then Jokic is off the floor,
*  and Westbrook's energy, we can run stuff through him.
*  His rebounding, he did some good stuff on the Clippers,
*  and then in the playoffs, it was an abomination.
*  He became unplayable in the Dallas series.
*  I mean, I remember watching those games.
*  What is he doing?
*  He was so.
*  He seemed deranged.
*  He was on tilt the whole series.
*  And like, yeah, like you said,
*  Denver is a bad free throw team.
*  Okay, he can just rampage to the rim
*  and maybe get us some free throws.
*  Sarich will probably be there back up five,
*  so he's a shooting center, a lot of space for us to attack,
*  and it worked out for the Clippers
*  for the first two, three months,
*  it was a feel good story.
*  I just don't think it's gonna be a game changer for them
*  in a positive way.
*  The best case scenario is it doesn't hurt, I think,
*  like Russ doesn't hurt.
*  But.
*  And buys them a couple months,
*  which I think Sarich is like this too.
*  There's these November, December players,
*  where you read the athletic story on December 10th,
*  it's like Sarich is really fitting in with the Nuggets.
*  And then you get to April
*  and he's playing four minutes a game,
*  and they seem to have a few of those.
*  But Murray's gonna determine this one way or the other.
*  Murray's, if Murray's not back to where he was two years ago
*  and whatever is going on with him continues,
*  there's no chance, the West is too good
*  and it's too much of a burden on Jokic, I think.
*  Well, the extension was a clear,
*  I mean, you have to interpret it
*  as a vote of confidence in him
*  because they didn't have to do it now,
*  they didn't have to do it before the season,
*  they could have just saw how he played in the preseason,
*  saw how he played early in the season,
*  they could have taken as long as they wanted to do it.
*  Like I've argued there is no plan B for them,
*  I don't know what the trade would be
*  to extricate themselves from this extension
*  in this situation and I love Jamal Murray.
*  But they did have the luxury of time
*  and they decided no, we're just buying,
*  we're going all in now on Jamal Murray,
*  we're gonna go all in on a bounce back year.
*  And I would like warning to everyone, including us,
*  he gets off to slow starts every season.
*  So like Jamal Murray's track record suggests
*  that on Thanksgiving he's gonna be shooting like 37%,
*  33% from three, the world's gonna be,
*  that's how it goes every year.
*  And so I'm not gonna panic if he's off to a bad start,
*  but if it's like January, February,
*  and it's like where is, where is like,
*  can you give me some glimpses of playoff Jamal Murray?
*  Because that's the whole thing, everything else.
*  Like I even think the KCP thing,
*  it's not awesome that you've lost Bruce Brown
*  and KCP and Jeff Green,
*  but I have some faith in the young guys
*  and I just have overwhelming faith in Jokic
*  to make everything work at its highest possible level
*  just provided he has just enough baseline talent around him
*  which has to include a pick and roll partner
*  who is ready at go time.
*  Like my take on the Nuggets,
*  there's some internal stuff that they've gotta sort out,
*  but I think, I don't know, man,
*  I still might pick them to make to finals this year
*  if they can figure out enough things.
*  I'm not as worried about the KCP thing as most people are.
*  I'm not as worried about it either,
*  but combined with the Bruce Brown,
*  and you think about how important those guys,
*  two years ago, it's just, there's undeniable that it's changed.
*  They have the, they're tied for the third best odds
*  for the conference.
*  OKC's plus 320, Minnesota plus 450,
*  and Dallas and Denver are both 5 to 1.
*  Have you decided, have you made a final,
*  you haven't, it's too early to make a finals pick, right?
*  Like you haven't made like your.
*  The only thing I did, I was in Boston for like mid August
*  and I bet on the OKC to win the conference
*  and the one seed stuff just cause the odds hadn't caught up
*  with the team.
*  Win the regular season?
*  Win the regular season.
*  I did regular season stuff with them
*  and then the conference stuff,
*  and now the odds have become the right odds,
*  but I felt like they were a little off there.
*  So I mean the big inefficiency is Memphis,
*  which was I think 22 to 1 to win the conference.
*  That's down to 16 to 1, but they might be.
*  I feel like a crazy person about Memphis,
*  and maybe they're on my list of worries,
*  so not worries, but like I'm so bullish on them
*  that I feel like a crazy person.
*  It worries you how much.
*  No, I have a specific thing that every time I'm like
*  head over heels about Memphis and like hammer the over,
*  like they could be the number two seed.
*  There's one thing that I keep coming back to,
*  but we can get to that later.
*  Milwaukee and Denver are the two things
*  we are the most worried about
*  heading into the 2024, 25 season.
*  What is your second pick?
*  So maybe this wasn't as high on your list
*  because it's a little bit of a cop out,
*  but number two on my list was Joel Embiid's knee.
*  I just like.
*  I had it.
*  I had it later, but I had the same thing.
*  Like I've been talking about this in relation to
*  back when flashback a year
*  and the whole Philly situation seemed a little bit uncertain.
*  Like, is this going to, is this going to hold together
*  or is he going to be the next guy that asks out?
*  And you've talked about various places
*  you might've asked out to go to.
*  And then maxi blows up to have a great season
*  and bead scores more than a point a minute.
*  They're cruising until he gets injured.
*  Then they get Paul George and Fraynstein.
*  Everything's all settled.
*  And I was talking about like,
*  can you really throw the five first round picks,
*  four swaps, best young players for Joel Embiid,
*  who is maybe the best player in the NBA when he's healthy,
*  but gets hurt all the time.
*  And this was before Jonathan Kaminga fell on his left knee
*  and he had a meniscus injury
*  and both his knees have been injured.
*  I think multiple times,
*  the left one has definitely been injured multiple times.
*  And it just is beginning to feel like an inevitability
*  that at some point in every season,
*  he's going to have an injury and it's no longer just the,
*  for a while it was like the freakish injuries,
*  like Pascal Siakam breaks his face.
*  He has the eye socket injury.
*  There were a couple others like that in the playoffs.
*  Now it feels like the lower body stuff is starting to pile up.
*  And maybe again, this is a cop out,
*  but this is a team that's obviously all in for this season
*  having signed Paul George.
*  And then they did a great, we all agree.
*  They did an amazing job in the off season,
*  rounding out the roster with Caleb Martin
*  and some smart minimum signings.
*  They are tailor-made to make a mid-season trade
*  to upgrade the three, four spots in the rotation.
*  And they have KJ Martin's contract, they have picks.
*  Everything is riding on this season.
*  And it just, it all falls away if Joel Embiid gets hurt.
*  And he seems to get hurt every year.
*  And the repetitive nature of them is very worrisome to me.
*  And it's frankly the reason why I'm not gonna pick them
*  to win the East.
*  I'm not gonna pick them to win the title
*  because Joel Embiid getting hurt feels like
*  a more likely event than Jason Tatum getting hurt,
*  or even Giannis getting hurt, which sounds crazy
*  because Giannis has missed the last two playoffs
*  with injuries, or anyone on the Knicks getting hurt
*  no matter how many minutes Tibbs plays everybody
*  all the time and they all got hurt at the end of last year.
*  How about me getting hurt?
*  I feel like I'm, like I play tennis all the time.
*  I feel like I'm a better bet to stay healthy.
*  I had Joel Embiid's body as one of my things.
*  I just think he's had too many injuries
*  and I don't think he's in shape.
*  And we haven't seen him really in shape.
*  And all you have to do is go back
*  and look at the videos of him during that run
*  when Jimmy Butler was on the team,
*  or look at him the first year when he played the 31 games.
*  Go look at him against Kansas.
*  He's carrying so much more weight now
*  on top of all the injuries that he has.
*  It's a recipe for disaster in the NBA.
*  We've seen it too many times.
*  The league has changed.
*  We shoot more threes.
*  The defense is better.
*  There's better scheming.
*  I get all of it, but one thing that has never changed
*  is physically if you've had a lot of injuries
*  and you're not in good shape,
*  you're gonna keep getting hurt.
*  And that's been the case since the 1950s
*  and it's gonna be the case with him.
*  And I'm with you.
*  I think when you're in the playoffs,
*  that is a nine month run.
*  And when you actually get to the playoffs,
*  that becomes 10 weeks, the highest intensity possible.
*  It favors the younger guys.
*  It's bad for the older guys.
*  It's bad for the injury prone guys.
*  I keep thinking about Blake Griffin when I think of Embiid
*  where Blake Griffin had all these different injuries.
*  Some were bad luck in his legs.
*  Others were like he broke his hand
*  punching the equipment manager.
*  But all of a sudden he had like seven or eight injuries
*  and if you're out of your up, it was like, oh shit.
*  And then the Quippers were like,
*  we're out of the Blake Griffin business.
*  We're trading them.
*  And then his body broke down a year later.
*  And I just think with centers, I'm with you.
*  I get it.
*  On paper, those three guys look awesome.
*  There's so many reasons why it might not work out
*  and there's a couple reasons why it could.
*  The one thing that surprised me was that
*  you thought he's the best player in the league
*  when he's healthy.
*  I just don't think he is.
*  I mean, I said maybe.
*  And last year, healthy Joel Embiid was,
*  what he was doing offensively was absolutely outrageous.
*  Like, look, I was early on the Jokic train.
*  I've been saying Jokic is the best player
*  in the NBA for a long time.
*  Last year, it was very close
*  because his scoring was just absolutely outrageous.
*  His turnovers were no longer.
*  His passing was better.
*  His assistant turnover ratio was better.
*  Like, so when Paul George signed in Philly,
*  there was some Paul George like,
*  Schadenfreude is too strong of a word,
*  but even Wendy was like,
*  how many times is Paul George gonna change teams
*  and we're all gonna go crazy about it
*  and it's the biggest story in the NBA?
*  And what does it lead to?
*  This is Wendy saying,
*  how many playoff series wins has it led to?
*  Like, what does it amount to?
*  And yeah, Paul George has some
*  not great playoff moments, notably in the bubble.
*  And then last year against Dallas, he was not good.
*  Not good enough.
*  I have no anxiety about Paul George as a Philadelphia 76er,
*  even in big playoff games.
*  Like, he's gonna be the third option.
*  It's a perfect role for him.
*  The pressure isn't the same.
*  All my sixers' anxiety is about Embiid.
*  That's the only reason I'm like,
*  this is not like my pick to make the finals.
*  It's all about his body.
*  And the one thing that they can control,
*  now he can control his conditioning.
*  He can't control the bad breaks
*  that he keeps suffering on the court.
*  They and he together can control the,
*  dude, the 65 game, like we're going for the MVP.
*  We gotta make all it,
*  like that stuff has gotta be over now.
*  The only thing that matters is
*  we just have to get your body as best,
*  we have to maximize our chances that April 15th comes
*  and you're ready to go at the highest possible level.
*  Everything else has to be secondary to that.
*  And I'll bet you having not talked to his people
*  or whatever, I'll bet you there's some agreement
*  internally on that.
*  Played 39 games last year.
*  I thought in the playoffs, I mean, in the Olympics,
*  he just looked really slow compared to where he was.
*  And I know he wasn't totally in shape, but that's-
*  I was gonna ask you about this.
*  You're a huge Olympics basketball guy.
*  I am, I love it.
*  You're a huge-
*  I love it.
*  And I think you have been like one million percent
*  vindicated on your, like, was it Booker who didn't,
*  what was the Team USA, the player who didn't play
*  Team USA one year and you had a whole thing about like,
*  do these guys not realize the opportunity
*  that they have to play for- I think it was Booker, yeah.
*  And you got sort of tisk-tisked around the internet
*  for like, you know, and I think you've been vindicated
*  because that experience clearly is helpful.
*  It clarifies some things about where you stand in the league.
*  It exposed you to all these different great players.
*  It exposed you to a different kind of pressure
*  on a different kind of stage.
*  It exposed you to like, I gotta figure out
*  this different game where the three point line is closer.
*  The spacing's all different.
*  The officiating's different.
*  All these variables that are different for me.
*  And I was what I've been dying to ask you
*  and be mostly disappointment for Team USA.
*  Other than the one game he was brought there to play
*  and the one game he was brought there to win,
*  which was the semi-finals against Serbia.
*  And I have said this already on my podcast.
*  I think, I wonder if we're gonna look back at that
*  at the whole summer of the NBA,
*  the whole off season of the NBA,
*  and say the single most important thing that happened
*  was the way Joel Embiid showed up in crunch time
*  as Team USA was about to get booted out of the Olympics.
*  And I don't mean that he scored some points
*  and played good defense and like battled Jokic 101.
*  I mean that after kinda like you and Rusilo
*  talked about this too in the playoffs,
*  kinda hot potatoing the ball sometimes
*  against the Knicks in crunch time.
*  He was more secure and hungry and like,
*  give me the goddamn ball.
*  I'm good, I'm gonna make this happen.
*  I'm confident, I'm steely.
*  In the fourth quarter of that game,
*  with so much pressure on him,
*  cause you know if they lose that game
*  and he has a shit game,
*  it's not gonna be great for Joel Embiid.
*  It's not gonna be great for Steve Kerr.
*  It's not gonna be great for anybody.
*  I honestly, I was watching that game being like,
*  this looks like a different guy to me
*  and if this is a transformational moment for him,
*  maybe that matters more than anything else
*  other than the injury stuff.
*  I was curious, but where did you watch that game?
*  What was your reaction to it?
*  So I had the same reaction watching it live
*  and he was really smart cause he knew Jokic
*  had the four fouls and he just started attacking him
*  and he knew that was gonna work.
*  Then I rewatched it and you know,
*  the irony of that game and that team in general
*  was that some of the reasons that they were down big points
*  were by some of the guys who ended up bringing them back.
*  Like Embiid, they just got killed on the offensive boards
*  when Embiid was out there.
*  LeBron and Curry couldn't guard anybody.
*  It almost cost them the game rebounding.
*  Yeah, it's that LeBron, Curry, Embiid defense,
*  it was just a three point shooting contest
*  for the other team basically
*  and then they figured it out down the stretch.
*  But I'm with you that I thought it was,
*  he just doesn't have a lot of moments
*  that you can point to where it's like,
*  it's fucking nut crunch time.
*  Can you make a couple shots for us?
*  And then Nick's series, I Know He Wasn't Healthy
*  and that's unfortunately probably gonna be his autobiography
*  or his biography until he flips it,
*  which he might this season.
*  But the title of his autobiography would be,
*  I Know He Wasn't Healthy, dot dot dot.
*  And that's just, he's been one of the bad luck guys
*  in the history of the league.
*  But I do think part of it is on him
*  because he's not in shape.
*  Get in shape, LeBron Embiid.
*  He did have a couple of massive scoring games
*  in that series on one leg, including a 50 point game.
*  He has a buzzer beater in the playoffs against the Raptors.
*  Remember that crazy three on a sideline out of bounds play.
*  His first round, nobody really cares.
*  First round, game three, puts you up three oh, whatever.
*  Don't defend his playoff resume.
*  It's not, you're not gonna get me to fight on this.
*  I'm not trying to do that,
*  but that did feel like, that Serbia game
*  felt like a moment that in a sports movie
*  would carry over into the next season.
*  Like in the movie, he'd get the ball late
*  in game seven of the second round against Boston.
*  And then there'd be like a flashback to the Olympics
*  on the right block against Jokic and everything on the line.
*  And then we'd flashback to the movie
*  and he'd use the same move
*  and make the same facial expression.
*  That's what would happen in a movie.
*  I'm gonna go.
*  My next one I'm concerned about.
*  I'll save the Celtics.
*  Well, this gives us an excuse to talk about the Grizzlies.
*  John Moran.
*  So the odds are dropping.
*  They are the stealth sleeper in the Western Conference.
*  John Moran has played 257 career games.
*  He's 25 years old.
*  He's made round two once.
*  He's played 70 games the last two seasons.
*  He's made one second team on the NBA.
*  And we've gone so glass half full on this.
*  I include myself,
*  because I think Memphis is gonna be really good.
*  I love that.
*  I can't wait, because you don't watch college.
*  I can't wait until like November 10th
*  when you're texting me about Zach Headey.
*  You're like, holy shit, Zach Headey, I love this guy.
*  It was just a really good pick.
*  He's gonna play for them.
*  They're getting all these guys back
*  and they were really dangerous two years ago
*  and three years ago.
*  And John had a couple of playoff series.
*  He had a playoff series where he averaged
*  I think high 30s.
*  He had two, I think two post seasons
*  where he was around 30.
*  And I just think we're penciling that guy back in,
*  but he's had a really tumultuous two years.
*  I have no idea where his head's at.
*  And the history of the league says this could go any way.
*  He might, this might be who he is.
*  He might just have a tumultuous career
*  and we'll look back at him and we'll say,
*  oh man, you know who was awesome?
*  John Moran.
*  His legacy would be Twitter videos
*  where it's like John Moran was a problem
*  and it's just him dunking on people.
*  I thought you were gonna say his legacy
*  was gonna be another kind of Twitter video.
*  Well, that too.
*  And just like a what could have been guy
*  or all the shit that happened in the last two years
*  has put him in the frame of mind where he's like,
*  you know what, this Anthony Edwards thing,
*  he's kinda took the spot that should have been mine.
*  I'm coming back hard.
*  I have my shits together.
*  I got new people around me and they're gonna be awesome.
*  I'm worried about the tumultuous side
*  in that we're just sad by December.
*  They're like, oh my God,
*  can this guy stay out of his own fucking way?
*  So that's why I have them second.
*  It all makes sense.
*  I mean, I guess John Moran's availability
*  is a cop out in the same way as Joel Embiid's health is.
*  It's an obvious thing to be worried about.
*  I guess I'm less worried about it
*  because he came back last season and he was awesome
*  and he made crunch time shots.
*  Remember that game against the Pelicans?
*  He had a massive shot, a game winning shot.
*  And then he hurt his shoulder,
*  which is just a thing that happens.
*  But he seemed to reintegrate himself
*  into the team pretty easily.
*  And you said stealth,
*  like they're the stealth sleeper in the West.
*  There shouldn't be anything stealth about them.
*  We know that when they have Morant and Bain and Jackson
*  and a decent supporting cast, they win a lot of games.
*  The playoff record is just, okay,
*  remember that insane series against the Timberwolves
*  in the first round the year they made the second round
*  and then the Dillon Brooks LeBron stuff happened
*  and they were summarily dismissed by the Lakers.
*  But you know why I said stealth?
*  Because until recently, the Lakers had better odds
*  to win the Western Conference than Memphis did,
*  which is just insane.
*  That's like, do people watch basketball?
*  I think the first time I checked there over and under
*  on ESPN bet, it was 44 and a half
*  and I was just like, how?
*  What's, I get the West is super deep
*  and so all of these teams are gonna beat up on each other.
*  Win totals might be deflated as a result of that,
*  at least outside Oklahoma City.
*  I just think there's nothing stealth about them.
*  My worry is, so I did go in and watch Edie College stuff
*  after they drafted him some.
*  And I see exactly what they want in him.
*  Like the screens, the short roll,
*  the monster offensive rebounding.
*  And the size, the motor, the motor is what everybody
*  loves about him and it's like the free throw shooting,
*  the ability to get to the line and make free throws.
*  They were super high.
*  You know the other piece of that that you'll love?
*  He's an end of the game.
*  We're up two, and we're gonna get fouled.
*  The other team's going for a steal.
*  Just lob it up to him and he catches it and gets fouled.
*  Big guys who can shoot, big guys who shoot 80 plus
*  with the line are just such a valuable thing
*  to have around.
*  It's a lot of pressure on a rookie to go in
*  and potentially be, I think he's the front runner
*  to be their starting center, if not already written in,
*  in Penn in the starting five.
*  That's just a lot of pressure, particularly defensively,
*  where they're gonna move him around so that maybe Jackson
*  can roam around and protect him.
*  Maybe they hide him here or over here when Jackson
*  can guard the point of attack, whatever it ends up being.
*  And Jackson in a big burly center has been a formula
*  that's worked for them.
*  It's just a lot of pressure on a rookie.
*  That's all.
*  Maybe given his deep college experience and all that,
*  he's the perfect rookie to walk in and accept
*  that kind of pressure and thrive on it
*  and not care about it.
*  Obviously his offensive role's gonna be a lesser one
*  than it was in college.
*  That's probably good.
*  But that's the only where I have is like,
*  you don't see a lot of potential top three to four seeds,
*  which is what I think Memphis is.
*  And if you wanna call that a contender, fine.
*  I think contender to win the whole thing
*  is a step too far for me at this point.
*  You don't see a lot of teams like that being like,
*  yeah, we're gonna start a rookie and play him
*  28 minutes a game or 25 minutes a game.
*  It's just not a thing that happens very often.
*  Yeah, I guess the counter would be,
*  he probably could've come out a year ago
*  and got this extra year.
*  So he's almost coming in.
*  He's like a second year guy versus a first year guy.
*  They're over under, went up to 47 and a half, by the way.
*  I'm taking it all the way up to 50.
*  Would you have preferred, for the fit on this team,
*  if we're just chasing wins this year and next year,
*  would you have liked Klingon or Eaddy
*  as their rookie center?
*  Either.
*  Either one.
*  I think, yeah, they just needed somebody who was size.
*  Is this a Brian and Ingram team to you?
*  That has been, that's been floated to me.
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't sense that that's a thing that's gonna happen.
*  Is there a Brian and Ingram team?
*  I think it's gonna be,
*  I went through a lot of the teams
*  that people around the league have suggested to me.
*  Like the Clippers had been suggested to me.
*  I didn't sense that there was anything going on there.
*  The Heat, I've pitched the Heat before.
*  I think you have too.
*  I think it's gonna be, I mean, this is one of my worries
*  is the branding Ingram thing for the Pelicans.
*  Like what the hell is going on there?
*  What is this team?
*  Yeah, they had New Orleans too.
*  We can do that quick.
*  So, he's still on the team.
*  I'm not sure how likely that was
*  when they made the DeJante-Murray trade
*  because now they have all these ball handlers
*  and no, I mean, Tice is their most experienced NBA center
*  and he's undersized as is.
*  And they seem to be just like,
*  we're gonna start Zion at center.
*  They might say, well, Herb Jones is taller than Zion,
*  so Herb Jones is a center, whatever.
*  It's just a strange team.
*  And now they have this thing hovering over them.
*  He skipped the informal mini camp thing
*  and had the Instagram, whatever,
*  passive aggressive Instagram video.
*  Is he gonna mope?
*  Is this gonna be a problem?
*  That would be a good website.
*  Passive aggressive hoops hype.
*  Just posts of passive aggressive things NBA players are doing.
*  But it's an unforced error.
*  This starts back at the end of the season
*  when Griffin, for whatever reason, is just like,
*  yeah, we gotta make changes, we're gonna do stuff.
*  And then the Ingram stuff starts immediately
*  and then they shop them around the league all summer
*  and it's an expiring contract, nobody wants them.
*  And now they're in the mess they're in.
*  He's somewhat of a victim of the Cooper flag
*  slash everybody wants to be in the top five of this draft.
*  So none of the bad teams, which could in theory be like,
*  yeah, we have assets, we'll buy on, what is he, 26, 25,
*  whatever he is, we'll buy on a young guy
*  who's borderline all star, whatever you think of him.
*  Wing position everybody needs.
*  None of those teams are super interested
*  in helping their win totals this year and next year.
*  He might be a good stats bad team guy
*  or good stats mediocre team guy
*  because he needs the ball a lot.
*  And it's interesting that Golden State
*  Kerr had him on that one World Championship team.
*  I think that's just a total no-go because of that.
*  Yeah, it's a no-go because they were like,
*  oh, this isn't the type of player
*  that succeeds in our system.
*  He wants the ball.
*  I don't think he's gonna succeed on this New Orleans team
*  with all the shooters and now you add Murray.
*  I mean, my concerns were beyond Zion
*  and Ingram trade machine and the fact
*  that he's gonna be in every trade.
*  Murray's not exactly like Jason Kidd in the mid-2000s.
*  Like he's gonna get his.
*  McCollum's gonna get his.
*  Zion's gonna get his.
*  Trey Murphy's gonna come off the bench.
*  He's gonna want some.
*  Why?
*  A lot of shots on this team.
*  Why can't we get Trey Murphy into the starting lineup?
*  Like we can't.
*  How about this?
*  We can't make CJ McCollum a sixth man.
*  It's like impossible to do.
*  Why?
*  Why can't we get Trey Murphy an extension?
*  That's the other crazy thing about them.
*  Like they're just like.
*  Like if we were the GMs of the Pelicans,
*  I'm pretty sure we would've locked down Trey Murphy
*  right now heading into his fourth season, right?
*  It's like let's not even talk about him.
*  Or would we just be.
*  You don't lock him down
*  because maybe he's the best trade chip you have.
*  Or you just don't lock him down
*  because he might come off the bench
*  and we might be able to squeeze him a little bit
*  in restricted free agency in the summer
*  because no one's gonna have cap space and whatever.
*  But this is the problem with that.
*  Because I get that.
*  And that's totally logical if you're running a team.
*  But now you're Trey Murphy.
*  And I'm pissed.
*  You're playing for an extension.
*  Now my minutes are going down
*  and I feel like the team is like deliberately
*  trying to lower my value.
*  It's just not, I don't.
*  There's a lot of subplots on this team.
*  So he's probably unhappy, I'm guessing.
*  Ingram, definitely unhappy.
*  Dejante Murray comes in, this is my team.
*  Zion, hey, this is my team.
*  I'm Zion Williamson.
*  There's just a lot going on and they have no center.
*  Tice is gonna be their starting center.
*  And Zion, those are their centers?
*  What are they gonna do when they play like Embiid?
*  I don't know, start, start.
*  They like the European guy they have coming over.
*  There's gonna be 10 centers
*  that they're gonna have to have some sort of answer to.
*  And I just feel like this team's been snake bit.
*  You think like Zion's,
*  you talked about that Embiid moment in the Olympics.
*  Zion's having this incredible game against the Lakers.
*  He is taking it to LeBron athletically
*  in a way that he just made LeBron seem like he was
*  50 years old and then he gets hurt.
*  The game's not even over.
*  He can't make it to the end of the game.
*  So to me New Orleans is out in the playoffs.
*  I don't have them in the playoffs.
*  I'm gonna keep working on this.
*  But if I had to pick eight teams,
*  I'm not sure they're one of the eight.
*  There's too much going on.
*  I don't like it.
*  I think we need to change the way we pick like playoffs.
*  I think we need to pick like a top six
*  and then everyone after that is in the play-in
*  or not in the play-in.
*  Yeah, the new school of playoffs.
*  What do you think their odds are
*  to make the playoffs right now?
*  Because we can look this up.
*  So they're minus one, at least on Fando,
*  minus 188 to make the playoffs,
*  which seems way too high to me.
*  Because I got OKC, I have Minnesota,
*  I have Denver, I have Dallas.
*  Put those in.
*  Memphis, Phoenix.
*  Now I'm in the Sacramento, New Orleans,
*  Lakers, Gold State, Houston group.
*  Maybe the Clippers.
*  And I don't know, makes me nervous.
*  All right, we gotta do the Celtics.
*  I can't wait to hear what you could possibly
*  be worried about about the Boston Celtics.
*  Bazaar Tatum Summer.
*  True.
*  Porzingis Health.
*  It's back in December.
*  Is he?
*  Are we sure it's December?
*  Because there's two Celtics teams.
*  There's the one that has Porzingis on it,
*  and then there's the one that doesn't
*  during the regular season.
*  So when they say December,
*  I'm just gonna assume February.
*  You know, they just won a title.
*  Everyone sacrifices when you win a title.
*  Everyone's just looking out for the greater good
*  of the team, then you win the title.
*  This is the premise of my entire book,
*  The Disease of Mora from Pat Riley.
*  It's just the sacrificing isn't as sacrificey
*  once you actually win the title,
*  so I'm worried about that.
*  The East is way, way, way, way better, right?
*  You have...
*  At the top.
*  Knicks way better.
*  Philly is gonna be better.
*  Miami is still kinda lurking.
*  Milwaukee is still kinda lurking.
*  Cleveland, Orlando are sitting there.
*  It's just not gonna be the same.
*  And then the Celtic sale is a pretty interesting
*  added piece to this,
*  because that thing's gonna move fast.
*  I don't think people realize how fast that's gonna go.
*  It's gonna be November, that team's gonna be sold.
*  Wow.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think it'll be mid-November.
*  The process is in the middle of a right now.
*  They're finishing their books.
*  They get the books out to the prospective buyers.
*  Kinda have a sense of who the buyers are, what it is,
*  and is this gonna be the Pagluca group that wins it?
*  Is it gonna be an outside group?
*  If it's an outside group,
*  those people are all bringing in their own people.
*  So now you have this organization
*  that felt like it was probably in the safest spot
*  of any of the 30 teams, right?
*  They had the most continuity.
*  They had people that had been there 15, 20 years.
*  They're at the finals thinking like,
*  this is great, man.
*  We have this nucleus.
*  We're all here.
*  We have so much continuity.
*  And then all of a sudden, there's gonna be this sale.
*  And the league wants six billion for it,
*  which I talked about on a pod,
*  I don't know, last month.
*  And they wanted to tie the expansion stuff.
*  So the league's gonna be really pushing.
*  They're gonna be pushing buyers.
*  They're gonna be turning over every stone.
*  And it's just a lot of uncertainty for a team
*  that should feel like they're in an awesome place.
*  They just won the title.
*  This is great.
*  And instead, they might have a new owner in December.
*  I think they're going to.
*  And WIC's done this thing about how it's gonna be
*  the staggered thing, and I'm still gonna be in charge.
*  I don't know, man.
*  I'm not signing up for that one.
*  For that being true, because we just watched that happen
*  with Cuban.
*  I'm gonna run the basketball operations.
*  We saw it in the finals.
*  The new people are running the Mavericks at the finals.
*  The new people do not want the old people around.
*  And that's gonna happen, I think, with the Celtics.
*  So whoever buys this team, if it's not the Pagluca group,
*  that's just a giant, giant monkey wrench
*  to bring into a title defense season.
*  We have sold the team.
*  Here are the new people.
*  They're bringing in their people.
*  And it makes me nervous.
*  But the Tatum piece makes me the most nervous,
*  because I don't know what happened to his outside shot.
*  I don't know if you have any insight on that.
*  I don't, other than I'm not gonna worry about it
*  until it becomes a thing in the NBA for like a month.
*  So let's talk about the sale.
*  Six is the number.
*  I mentioned it over the spring, summer, whenever this broke.
*  That would be the high watermark.
*  I think that's high.
*  I think that's gonna turn.
*  Maybe a bidding war emerges of such frothiness
*  that we get there.
*  But from what I've heard,
*  that's gonna end up being a little high.
*  I agree.
*  But maybe.
*  And then you mentioned Pagluca.
*  From what I've heard, he's deep in this, obviously.
*  Are you rooting for him to get it
*  just for the sake of stability?
*  Is that the best possible outcome for the 2025 Celtics?
*  I think if you're a fan of the,
*  and I'm gonna sound like I'm in the bag for this.
*  I have no horse in the race.
*  I'm just a fan of continuity
*  and the fact that he's been there this whole time.
*  I think it's super icy with Wick and Pagluca right now too,
*  which I don't know whether that affects
*  whether he gets it or not.
*  But his son, everybody likes that.
*  He went to Duke and it's a situation.
*  He was there when Tatum was there, was he not?
*  Yeah, it's a situation where
*  sometimes this can go horribly when it's like,
*  yeah, I'm gonna take over and groom my son.
*  And it's like, oh my God.
*  The son actually seems like he's pretty good
*  and the buzz on him is excellent.
*  So, you know, and a lot of the minority owners
*  that are tied to the Pagluca team
*  are the people that, a lot of them are already there.
*  So from a continuity standpoint, that feels the best.
*  I'm with you.
*  I think the six seems high
*  because you don't have the arena.
*  But if-
*  The arena situation is a disaster for the Celtics.
*  It's a disaster and it's not a disaster
*  because their lease goes to like 2034
*  and that's plenty of time to build your own thing.
*  I thought some of the stuff Cuban has said recently,
*  I thought was really instructive and interesting about
*  how when he took over,
*  the NBA was moving to a technology phase in the early 2000s
*  and that was a huge advantage for him.
*  And then he's like, now we're in a real estate phase
*  and I'm not as equipped to succeed in that phase
*  as I was in the last one.
*  Now that might've been part bullshit because we still,
*  nobody really fully understands why he sold the Mavericks.
*  I still don't have an answer for that.
*  But I do think he's right.
*  Like I think what happened with the Warriors
*  where they bought the team at a crazy cheap price,
*  10 tupled it, 20 tupled it, whatever it was,
*  but then realized we need our own arena.
*  We need everything to fund through us.
*  We need a place that we're the centerpiece of.
*  We can have concerts, we can have all these events
*  and the real estate of it,
*  all the tax breaks from it is great.
*  Whoever buys the Celtics is gonna have to think that way.
*  And there's a bunch of good locations
*  that they came up with during the Olympics
*  when they had the Olympics bid for five seconds.
*  There's spots to do it.
*  You're just gonna have to pay money and grease some people.
*  One of the groups that I think is possibly involved
*  is the group that brought the Olympics.
*  That the bid that fell through,
*  they're construction building people.
*  But I don't know how it's gonna play out.
*  There's always a casino option.
*  The casino's super successful there.
*  And I don't know if the wind group has the pockets.
*  I don't think they do,
*  but it could be them with somebody else
*  and they wanna build an arena next to the casino.
*  But the point is anything you read or hear about this
*  other than some people circling it,
*  which like I talked about the Bezos thing,
*  there's people circling, but nobody's gonna know
*  until they send the books out and they get the process going.
*  And there could be a wild card or two.
*  I might bet if I gave you over under five and a half,
*  would you go over under?
*  I'd go slightly under.
*  Yeah, I'm thinking five, two to five, four range.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know how this goes with rich guys
*  if two people want it.
*  And it starts up and up.
*  And I know Pat Gubka.
*  Same thing with contract extensions
*  on guys like Trey Murphy.
*  The line gets held and then the deadline approaches.
*  All right, what's an extra four million to get this done
*  and keep Trey Murphy?
*  Okay, fine, just boom, done.
*  And then the other piece is the stuff with Wick and his dad.
*  That story is gonna come out at some point.
*  I don't think the right version of the story has come out yet,
*  but I think that's been the biggest head scratcher
*  this whole thing because the herb, the legend,
*  like rich guy legend, all time,
*  like great businessman, just revered
*  and made one of the great investments of all time.
*  And that's somehow, sometimes how these guys think.
*  Where it's like, I 20-tupled my investment.
*  I am disciplined with this.
*  It's time to get out.
*  Now Epstein, who I think owns 15% of the team,
*  I assume he's gonna sell because he did his job.
*  He 20-tupled the investment.
*  He's gonna get the fuck out.
*  So it's a lot, my point is it's a lot of flux
*  with this Celtics team that this should be a happy thing.
*  They're defending the title.
*  We should have, instead there's five variables already.
*  So that's what I'm worried about.
*  The basketball stuff, I'm just gonna assume
*  that Tatum will be Tatum and this will all just be
*  a random slump, flip on the radar, whatever.
*  The disease of me, the disease of more,
*  I can't remember which one it is
*  because I think it's disease of me.
*  I call it disease of more,
*  but then some other people say me.
*  I just don't, I hadn't even thought about that with them
*  because who wants more?
*  Tatum and Brown already get a ton.
*  White in holiday are unselfish and have been paid
*  and just play the way they do.
*  Poor Zingis is just out there to shoot threes.
*  They play this and post-up switches like we saw in the finals
*  when he went bananas over all the Mavericks defenders
*  in game one.
*  And they play this five out, fast moving system
*  that just seems to lend itself well to ball movement
*  and Tatum and Brown still get their 25 plus a game.
*  I just didn't think about that for them.
*  I didn't think about that for them.
*  I mean, poor Zingis is hurt,
*  but they still have Horford, Cornett, Cata,
*  who's pretty good.
*  Still Horford, is he 40 yet?
*  He's like 39.
*  Ageless, ageless.
*  What's a realistic minute limit for him?
*  Yeah, look, they have White in holiday who,
*  if they aren't the two most unselfish guys in the league,
*  they're in the first team all NBA
*  for whatever the list that is.
*  You have Horford, same thing.
*  There's a lot of, Joe Mazzulla, I think,
*  had an awesome second year.
*  And I think even when Tatum was struggling during the Olympics,
*  Mazzulla flew out to France
*  to kind of make sure everything was okay.
*  That guy's locked in, knows his roster.
*  I think the jump he made from year one to year two
*  has been astounding.
*  People love that dude.
*  Going from the days that my dad and I
*  called him second row Joe, he's been amazing.
*  There was a list of, some website had a list
*  of the 30 best coaches and he was like 11th.
*  It's like, how is this dude 11th?
*  They just won 80 games in a season.
*  I'm worried about the Tatum thing.
*  He was third, I had him third coach of the year anyway.
*  I'm worried about the Tatum thing.
*  I wanna see him, I talked about this on the pod last month,
*  but going back and watching his shot as a rookie
*  versus where it is now with this hitch that he has.
*  Eddie Johnson had a theory that maybe he put on
*  too much weight, which is happening with NBA,
*  too much muscle.
*  And sometimes guys get muscle and it kind of changes
*  how they shoot, but I just, it got to the point
*  of the Olympics, I mean he was 0 for 16 from outside.
*  That's a crazy stat.
*  He could not, they couldn't play him.
*  That was the reason he wasn't playing.
*  So anyway, what do you have for the next one?
*  We can go in a number of different directions for this one,
*  depending on kind of what team you wanna hit.
*  I just kind of wanna talk about this team,
*  so I'll pretend they were higher on my list.
*  I got a lot of small worries about Minnesota
*  that adds up to me just being like,
*  all of the signs should point to Minnesota
*  being a very sensible finals pick.
*  Conference finals, broke through,
*  beat Denver on the road in game seven.
*  Great series from Towns, at least shooting wise
*  in that series, made big shots, shot 40% from three,
*  50% from the field against the Juggernaut,
*  the defending champion, the team we all picked
*  to win the West last year.
*  Yeah, they lose the conference finals.
*  There's the Lucas shot and Rudy's face, just bad series.
*  Towns is bad again and whatever.
*  But everything's ascending upwards.
*  They have the ascendant young superstar in the NBA
*  in Anthony Edwards, a guy who wants all the smoke
*  and crunch time, exactly the kind of player you want
*  handling the ball late.
*  Everything's pointing up and yet I just have a little anxiety.
*  I have anxiety about everyone in their rotation
*  after their top seven guys.
*  So they have a great starting lineup,
*  then they have Nas Reid, Six Man of the Year,
*  and Nikia Alexander-Walker.
*  And after that, it's the kids and Joe Ingalls.
*  That makes me a little nervous.
*  I'm counting on the kids and Joe Ingalls.
*  Joe Ingalls has been done for three years.
*  Yeah, Conley's old.
*  You can talk me into Joe Ingalls shot 43% last year.
*  He's got great pick and roll chemistry with Rudy.
*  That's cool.
*  Mike Conley is 37 on opening night,
*  will be 37 by opening night.
*  They can kind of get lost offensively
*  when he's not on the floor and he's 37.
*  And they're relying on a lottery pick for the other minutes.
*  Talk about weird summers.
*  Rudy Gobert got benched by France
*  and made fun of by pretty much everyone
*  who has a platform in the NBA.
*  I mean, it's a little ridiculous,
*  but was the Rudy cat fit?
*  Was that real last year?
*  The offense still wasn't great.
*  By the way, he's eligible for an extension right now.
*  Is that gonna be a thing?
*  I still think the team can make the finals.
*  They should get far in the playoffs.
*  I guess what I'm saying is I'm more worried
*  is too strong a word.
*  I'm more cautious about Minnesota
*  than everything about their timeline suggests
*  that I should be.
*  You made a great case.
*  I wrote down the year after
*  where they had this great breakthrough moment
*  and sometimes we see in the league
*  that you almost have to take a step back
*  before you then make the next step forward.
*  Ant Mania in 2024, I'm concerned about.
*  Like he's gonna be the star of this Netflix show.
*  Yeah, I'm sure he's gonna be the star of this show.
*  I'm sure he's gonna be in a bunch of commercials.
*  He's gonna be all over the place.
*  He's a real attraction.
*  I think he can handle it, but I wanna see it.
*  Is Go Bear playable at this point?
*  Against certain teams?
*  Did the league unlock how to attack him?
*  Then Towns, Towns is almost 30 at this point.
*  He kinda is who he is.
*  They're relying on that lottery pick,
*  dealing him to actually play big minutes.
*  I really like him and our college guys
*  were big fans of his,
*  trying to create an offense.
*  And they're in a hard conference
*  and they're gonna have a bullseye on them
*  and they're not gonna be taking anyone by surprise.
*  So that would be the case.
*  So I have a bunch of things that I'm more worried about
*  than I'm, like I'm more worried about the heat
*  than I am about the Timberwolves.
*  I'm more worried about Zach Levine's future,
*  whatever it is, than I am about the Timberwolves.
*  So I just wanted to talk about the Timberwolves.
*  I'm more worried about the Suns than the Timberwolves,
*  but I wanted to talk about Minnesota,
*  so I elevated them.
*  I think as basketball fans, it would just be,
*  it would hurt the most that the Timberwolves
*  weren't as fun as they probably should be this year.
*  Like the Heat, they had their run and it might be,
*  I had them down, you know,
*  for all the reasons you would think.
*  But I think with Minnesota,
*  I think we're kind of counting on them.
*  I think the league's counting on them.
*  I think the league is really counting on Ant.
*  And you could feel it during the Olympics.
*  He's got the respect of the older guys,
*  which is really important.
*  And I think for people like my son, he turned into a guy,
*  casual NBA fans under 20 are like, I like this guy.
*  This is my guy.
*  I'm adopting him as my not-of-my-favorite-team guy.
*  I'm going with both LA teams, Zach.
*  There's a world where neither of them are playoff teams.
*  I think if you were gonna isolate it,
*  if you made me pick between who are you more worried about,
*  just the Clippers launching this new arena
*  that by all accounts is incredible.
*  And they're launching around a guy who doesn't play
*  and a guy who doesn't play defense.
*  And it's like, come see us.
*  Or JJ Reddick, who I think is in the least enviable
*  coaching situation of anybody in a long time.
*  Maybe, I guess, Missoula after E-Man got fired.
*  That was tough.
*  Like, holy shit.
*  You're talking about being thrown in the fire.
*  Wait a second.
*  Just ask your old podcast buddy, Doc Rivers.
*  There's nothing worse than taking over a team.
*  I wouldn't wish that upon anyone.
*  Anybody.
*  I know.
*  Following Adrian Griffin in the middle of a season
*  for a team with Yannis and Dame,
*  I just can't imagine a worse fate.
*  Yeah, well, JJ might have a worse fate.
*  This team's gonna be,
*  because what happened is you have LeBron and AD,
*  who had 10 weeks off for the Olympics,
*  basically had to play in six games, played really well.
*  And I was guilty of it.
*  I said it after the gold medal game.
*  It's like, shit, when you watch these guys
*  play at this level, it makes you think like,
*  why can't the Lakers put a championship team around them?
*  And then afterwards I was like, why did I say that?
*  Because part of this league is,
*  you gotta play for nine months.
*  It can't be like, hey, we gotta ramp up for six games.
*  You gotta ramp up for 95.
*  And this team is gonna have this-
*  Their fifth starter is not Devin Booker.
*  Right, right.
*  And they don't have all NBA guys coming off the bench.
*  The Bronie thing's gonna be super weird.
*  It just is.
*  It's gonna be a story day after day after day
*  on top of the fact that if this team doesn't do that well.
*  Wait, wait, wait, but what, like,
*  do you think that continues to be true
*  if and when he's just in the G League and he's over here
*  and we're not talking about the South Bay Lakers
*  on NBA Today or maybe we will be, I don't know.
*  Do you think it remains a thing?
*  Do we think he's gonna be in the G League?
*  I would think so.
*  I would think for, I think JJ is-
*  They gave him a guaranteed contract.
*  That's fine.
*  I will be very surprised if he doesn't spend part
*  of the season in the G League.
*  Listen, you get clicks and you get paid views
*  if you put any story with Bronie in it
*  for basically from the preseason on.
*  That's just how it's gonna go.
*  You saw a glimpse of it in Summer League
*  and then that's how it's gonna keep going.
*  And if he's not playing for the first 10 days,
*  then that becomes a story.
*  Is Bronie, is JJ burying Bronie?
*  He's 100% playing in the opening game
*  so that they can have a moment together.
*  That's gonna happen.
*  So they pass to each other, whatever it ends up being.
*  It's one of the coolest NBA situations we've had
*  and it's also gonna be one of the weirdest
*  because imagine being on the team.
*  We saw a glimpse that there was already grumblings
*  about the Summer League team about how everything
*  was built around trying to get Bronie to succeed
*  and some of the other guys were like, what the fuck?
*  I just think it's gonna be a story.
*  I'm gonna try to avoid the story as much as possible
*  because I don't really care.
*  I think the most interesting thing to me is
*  what does LeBron have?
*  Is he even a playoff guy anymore?
*  Can he play enough games?
*  Can he play more than 55, 60 games in a season
*  with all the miles he has?
*  Will AD ever be that healthy again?
*  Is there gonna be a difference between
*  Darvin Ham and JJ as a coach?
*  Was Darvin a scapegoat for last year?
*  The Laker fans were out on him.
*  Polinka was out on him but really,
*  what were you gonna do with that roster anyway?
*  It was pretty strange.
*  So there's that and then the Clippers side is just,
*  it's a team built around Kawhi Leonard and James Harden
*  who were in their mid-30s though.
*  Who do you think will have a better record of the two
*  if he had to pick?
*  It's a great question.
*  I probably would pick the Clippers
*  because of their role guys that,
*  no, now I don't know.
*  I don't know, who would you?
*  I would pick the Lakers.
*  I would pick the Lakers.
*  Because if LeBron plays 60 games,
*  it's probably the Lakers, right?
*  They'll go like 43 and 39?
*  Well, does either of those teams have a chance
*  to win 46 games?
*  Yeah, I think the Lakers do.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I think they do.
*  I think those two guys, if they have health
*  like they did last year, which is a big if,
*  I think those guys are that good.
*  Well, how about the flip side of the question?
*  Which team has a lower basement?
*  It's the Clippers.
*  The glass half empty version of the Clippers season
*  is like the glass is actually empty.
*  Yeah, the glass has smashed.
*  My daughter threw the glass off the table
*  and it smashed on the floor.
*  The glass has smashed, people are stepping on it.
*  There's blood.
*  And Sam Presti just in the corner with a broom going,
*  I'll clean that up for you.
*  Hey there.
*  I am pessimistic about the Clippers.
*  I've been pessimistic about the Clippers
*  since the off season unfolded the way it did.
*  I still don't really understand
*  what they did with Paul George.
*  God bless Ty Lueb.
*  He's a great coach.
*  And he had, in a story that we had,
*  Ohm Jungmuss who had it about like,
*  I can't wait to prove everybody wrong.
*  I'm like, cool, I don't see it.
*  So I will be one of the people that you prove wrong
*  if you indeed win more than 40 games or whatever,
*  if you're a 500 or if you're better than 500.
*  I just don't, I don't see it.
*  Well, the Kawhi will get hurt.
*  Kawhi getting sent home from the Olympics was rough.
*  Kawhi will miss games and harden with a bunch of,
*  you know, like okay players around him.
*  I just don't see it.
*  The Lakers, I think what's not being talked about
*  about the Lakers and all the focus on Bron and AD
*  and bronze age and can they stay healthy
*  to the degree they were last year?
*  And then the brawny thing and the JJ thing.
*  The Lakers depth terrifies me,
*  but I like their starting five.
*  I'm not a D-Low guy, but I still like their starting five.
*  I think it works.
*  D-Low, Reeves, Rui, LeBron, AD,
*  assuming that JJ starts that lineup, which he should.
*  Who do you trust after that?
*  Like after that, it's Gabe Vincent
*  who missed basically all of last season.
*  And then a bunch of guys who are either totally unproven
*  or proven to be guys that probably should be
*  at the very back of your rotation.
*  If they're helped, like even Jared Vanderbilt,
*  who Laker fans love.
*  Okay, like can we fast forward to the point
*  where he gets played off the floor in a playoff series?
*  Like after that, after him, it's like Jackson Hayes,
*  Dalton Connect, Hood Shafino, Max Christie,
*  who I'm optimistic about, has proven nothing in the NBA.
*  So everyone focuses on LeBron and AD.
*  I think he is gonna play, but he's gotta earn minutes.
*  You got a decent contract.
*  Everyone focuses on LeBron and AD.
*  I'm like, man, if Austin Reeves misses 20 games,
*  who's taking those minutes?
*  That's what scares me more about the Lakers
*  almost than the fact that LeBron
*  is about to turn 40 years old.
*  Well, and you didn't even mention the other hallmark
*  of these LeBron teams is if it starts out slow,
*  everyone's in trade rumors by Thanksgiving.
*  And then it's just, we're just in trade rumor season
*  with the Lakers from, I would say Thanksgiving
*  all the way through till we actually had the trade deadline.
*  And every guy on that team is,
*  except for maybe AD, is not safe.
*  And they have the two picks to trade.
*  They have Connect, who would have trade value,
*  though they love him, and JJJ is already drawing up,
*  plays on the whiteboard during the draft
*  for Dalton Connect, which is cool.
*  He can really shoot.
*  I don't know who the guy is that they're, you know,
*  putting all those chips, putting some of those chips in for.
*  I've kind of joked before, said before,
*  I think Jeremy Grant makes some sense for them
*  just because I don't think.
*  Like that's not gonna win them the title.
*  Well, but I don't think, when Portland gets religion,
*  I don't think the cost of Jeremy Grant
*  is gonna be that high.
*  I don't think they're getting this mother load
*  for Jeremy Grant that they think they should get.
*  And so when the cost gets to a point
*  where the Lakers can meet it,
*  but then you're gonna have to trade
*  a real salary or two to get there.
*  And I don't know who that is, that the Lakers could,
*  it's not like you could just trade Rui Hachamur.
*  It's like, oh, this guy's a meaningless $18 million.
*  No, he's like a starter on your team that you need.
*  So I don't know what the move is.
*  Like you can sit here and talk about
*  at any of the potentially distressed star players
*  that want out or borderline star players.
*  I don't know that any of them are available
*  or even helped the Lakers that much.
*  Like is Zach Levine changing your life as a Lakers?
*  If they could even mechanically do that trade,
*  like it's not, like really?
*  I mean, really the move would be to go the other way
*  because I don't think they have any chance
*  of winning a title with this team.
*  You go the other way and you shot Davis,
*  but they're just not gonna do that.
*  See, I don't think they can win the title.
*  I don't think they're a contender really, but I will say.
*  They have no chance to win the title.
*  I have so much respect for LeBron and AD
*  that you put them up against pretty much any team
*  in the West in one playoff series.
*  Like yeah, they could steal this series.
*  Like they could just man. They could steal a round, yeah.
*  Yeah, they could man.
*  Even like last year, now this is a totally different
*  Thunder team that I think is gonna be a juggernaut,
*  but remember last year all the buzz was like,
*  oh, the Thunder, Dave, the Lakers
*  would really be a dangerous opponent for the Thunder.
*  I would have picked the Thunder in that series,
*  but that's neither here nor there.
*  Like they'll just steal some games
*  and then they'll steal a series,
*  but I keep saying this on TV.
*  It's a boring take.
*  Winning three playoff series or two playoff series,
*  whatever it is, is just such a much different animal
*  than scrounging your way to four wins one time.
*  Like it's just so hard to do.
*  It's the same issue the Warriors have.
*  Yeah, it takes so much endurance.
*  It takes so much stamina.
*  It takes so much depth.
*  Like I just don't see any world in which they can do that
*  as presently constructed.
*  I guess the big disappointment for me the last few years
*  is I just don't feel like ESPN was covering the Lakers.
*  Do you think like maybe they'll do more content
*  in the Lakers this year
*  or is it just gonna be like it was last year?
*  I'm gonna predict we do a little bit less content
*  on the Lakers, but maybe not.
*  I don't know.
*  What do you have for your next pick?
*  I can go anywhere with this one.
*  Should we talk about Julius Randall maybe?
*  How about that?
*  They were gonna be my last pick, so let's do it.
*  Like what's gonna happen with that?
*  None of the next games don't wanna hear it.
*  They don't wanna hear it.
*  Well, cause I don't think it's something
*  that's gonna like derail this team
*  that's destined for greatness or something,
*  but it's a big piece of their team
*  who one way or another they need talent
*  and he's talent and he can score and he can get buckets.
*  He improved in a million different ways last season
*  before he got hurt.
*  I loved the way he was playing off of Brunson,
*  a little more active defensively,
*  a little more active as a passer and off the ball,
*  but he's a $29 million salary slot
*  that they either need his talent or down the line,
*  not thinking beyond this year,
*  that needs to turn into something
*  and I don't know what the answer to it is.
*  Just anytime you go into a season
*  where a guy's eligible for extension,
*  he doesn't get it, he's gonna be a free agent,
*  likely as a result, and he's been a two-time
*  all-NBA player on your team, a really, really good player,
*  that is just a thing that you have to monitor.
*  There's that.
*  He's gonna be in trade rumors
*  if they start out 10 and eight or whatever.
*  There's also the, I'm not sure who they're finishing five is
*  and whoever gets left out is probably gonna be like,
*  what the fuck?
*  Could change night to night, right?
*  Brunson, Bridges, and Ananobe are all out there.
*  Randall Hart, Di Fincenzo, Mitchell Robinson,
*  two of those four, depending on the matchup.
*  Di Fincenzo, who was awesome last year,
*  who now might be a 20 minutes a game guy,
*  it's like, what the fuck, man?
*  I was out there killing it for you guys.
*  Now I'm basically coming off the bench Eddie House style.
*  I'm just monitoring it.
*  It's something I've been teasing my Knicks fan friends
*  around a lot.
*  I also think they're, you know, not rocket science,
*  they're really gonna miss Hartenstein.
*  He was super important for them last year
*  and provided something that they no longer have
*  in any capacity.
*  I don't trust Mitchell Robinson to stay healthy at all.
*  I think he might be a worse health bet than Embiid.
*  They will address this center thing one way or another.
*  It may be via trade, it may end up having to involve Randall,
*  but I don't know, I don't even know what to expect
*  with Randall.
*  By the way, not as many centers,
*  because you hear this in New Orleans too,
*  it's like, oh, well they'll get a center.
*  It's like, who?
*  Go through the 30 rosters, what center are they getting?
*  You want the Andre Eaton?
*  Dominating.
*  I like Robinson and Achua as a platoon.
*  I think that's fine if they,
*  this is where the bridges trade,
*  I think an under discussed element of it is,
*  he's a big talent injection in terms of just all around
*  talent, including offensive creativity.
*  Like what he did in Brooklyn,
*  at least the first half year he was there,
*  he fell off a little last year.
*  That was like legit secondary creator on a good team stuff.
*  If that carries over, they have a little more leeway
*  in terms of what they can get.
*  Like you mentioned Hardenstein
*  and what they can't replace from him.
*  Defensively he was amazing, but his passing,
*  his floater game, he was a release valve for them
*  offensively that they in theory should need less
*  with McHale Bridges there as a secondary,
*  third creator, whatever.
*  And in TIBS, there was a Q&A with TIBS today on NBA.com
*  where he cracked the door open to playing Randall
*  at the five more.
*  I think they're gonna have to.
*  And the reason, and this is something
*  Knicks fans have talked about is Ananobe is so good
*  at guarding above his size that he can actually be
*  the five on defense so Randall doesn't have to guard
*  the big centers of the world.
*  And maybe that's the way this door finally gets unlocked.
*  And that changes the minutes patterns for everybody
*  that way in a way that might make sense.
*  I think the Knicks are gonna be awesome.
*  Like I really love this team.
*  I cannot wait to watch them.
*  I'm with you.
*  I'm nitpicking on possible ways it could go wrong.
*  But one thing I like is that they're,
*  we always talk about how teams feel like they have
*  to do this need to finish their team in July.
*  And this is a team that they're gonna start the season,
*  they're gonna be totally fine,
*  their defense is gonna be really good.
*  They have one of the 10 best offensive players in the league,
*  maybe even higher than that in Brunson.
*  You can kind of move along and see what's missing.
*  And then by the time we get to January, maybe you'll know.
*  I'm really excited to watch Bridges and Inunobi together.
*  And I think they're gonna be,
*  I think the Celtics Knicks games this year
*  are gonna be fucking awesome.
*  This is like, if you're building a team,
*  it's exactly the two guys you would want to throw
*  at Tatum and Brown.
*  I thought they were the second best team
*  in the East last year.
*  I said it basically the whole season,
*  especially after Inunobi.
*  I think they were the biggest threat to Boston last season.
*  Boston is never gonna have a play.
*  The fact that Boston got through the East
*  without playing any of New York, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee,
*  and I know all those teams were injured,
*  that's just an incredible run of matchup, whatever.
*  Not luck, it's not luck.
*  It's just like, the chances of that happening,
*  we talk about these four teams all season long
*  and one team wins the East
*  and doesn't have to play any of the others is just crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  I actually looked up,
*  I was trying to see what the biggest wind drops were
*  for any finals team who won more than 64 games,
*  which 64 or higher.
*  It was the 2008 Mavs dropped 16 games from 07
*  when they were like 67 and 15, whatever,
*  and then the Warriors beat them.
*  The we believe Warriors just broke them.
*  74 Celtics, oh, that team did make finals.
*  The 2001 Lakers was 11, 92 Bulls was 10,
*  14 Heat was 12, and the 84 Sixers dropped by 13.
*  So the Celtics won 64.
*  I think even if you're going super pessimistic
*  and Porzingis doesn't come back till February,
*  them dropping in the mid-50s is just historically,
*  unless there was a major injury,
*  about as low as it could possibly drop.
*  So my point is for the one seed,
*  I wonder what the Knicks have to get to
*  to actually challenge.
*  The Celtics, because I'm just super dubious
*  to the Porzingis thing.
*  When they throw out December,
*  don't you, when you hear this stuff now,
*  don't you just add like four to six weeks
*  when you hear a date like that?
*  So yeah, December.
*  Especially when you have the luxury of the talent
*  that the Celtics are gonna have,
*  like there's no need to rush them back.
*  What was, by the way, what was the most stressful segment
*  of a playoff game for you as a Celtics fan last year?
*  Was there ever a moment you were like
*  legitimately tense?
*  When they blew game four the way they did,
*  even though I thought they were better than Dallas,
*  but the Porzingis injury,
*  having no idea what to expect from him,
*  there was part of me wondering what happens
*  if Luka just scores like 29 in the first half here
*  in game five and becomes one of those 2012
*  Celtics Miami game six LeBron situations
*  where the best part in the court
*  just is awesome in the first half
*  and now we're down 18 heading into halftime
*  with the thought of going back to Dallas.
*  I remember walking around that day,
*  I did like a three and a half hour power walk
*  all around Boston.
*  I just had the nervous energy of like,
*  I just don't wanna fucking go back to Dallas.
*  I think everybody felt that way
*  and you could feel it in the building.
*  Then when they came out and Porzingis looked pretty good.
*  I mean, what Porzingis did in that game,
*  it's gonna slip through the cracks of history,
*  but that was incredible.
*  The guy just had a surgery
*  that's gonna take him out six to eight months
*  and he played on it and was pretty effective,
*  especially in the second half.
*  I think that was the darkest for me.
*  His game one was an all time just bonkers crowd moment
*  to like coming out into the arena late,
*  crowd goes crazy and then he just,
*  it was the best stretch of his entire career.
*  He was blocking shots, hitting trail trees,
*  dunking on people, blocking dunks.
*  I can't, there's one team that I cannot believe
*  we haven't talked about.
*  What is it?
*  The Suns.
*  I have them down.
*  Is it too obvious?
*  I actually, I isolated the Suns into just Kevin Durant.
*  Because I feel like we are.
*  Well, we're at this, I feel like this is it for him
*  as an elite guy on a good team,
*  just with the age he's at,
*  with some of the injury history he's had.
*  And you can make excuses for the last couple of years
*  in all these different ways,
*  but it was a bed that he bought and chose to lie in
*  and was responsible for just about all the decisions for it.
*  But now that the fact that they got Tyus Jones
*  on top of having to play all together for a year,
*  the fact that Booker and KD had
*  that Olympic experience together,
*  the fact that the West,
*  none of us know what to make of the West.
*  Okay, so he's clearly the regular season favorite,
*  but I have no idea who's in play for number two.
*  And then just like where his career is,
*  I feel like he needs one more awesome season
*  because it shouldn't take the Olympics
*  for him playing well to people like,
*  I forgot Kevin Durant was this good.
*  It kind of felt like he had fallen into that hole, right?
*  He'd become a, I forgot he was this good guy.
*  And just as a lifelong Durant fan,
*  I would love to see him have an awesome year
*  and I'd love to see the suns be good,
*  but I don't know if it's realistic.
*  So you said something interesting in there,
*  which is you have no idea who to pick
*  for the number two seed in the West,
*  which goes back to how we opened this episode
*  where I was like, the most interesting thing to me
*  is everything below Oklahoma City
*  and the regular season standings in the West.
*  Cause I have like, you can put all,
*  you can say all these teams are the clear top four.
*  I just don't think it's gonna unfold that way.
*  And there's gonna be an interloper from below somewhere.
*  We've talked about Memphis.
*  I think the suns are maybe being underrated a little bit
*  as one of those potential interlopers
*  because of the bad taste, the playoff,
*  just obliteration by Minnesota.
*  I mean, they were awful.
*  There's no way around it.
*  Minnesota destroyed them, bullied them,
*  made them look helpless.
*  They won 49 games last year, despite the big three
*  barely even, not even getting, I don't think,
*  to half a season in games played together.
*  Well, every team's gotta have a,
*  like they're three best guys, whatever,
*  Durant, Booker and Beal.
*  I'm out.
*  I never wanna hear the word big three again now.
*  Putting Bradley Beal in a big three is just offensive
*  to the history of big threes.
*  The big two and Bradley Beal playing only three games.
*  That sounds way better.
*  Only like half a season together.
*  They won 49 games.
*  That's a lot of games.
*  They upgraded a point guard.
*  That's a meaningful thing.
*  They brought back Royce O'Neal,
*  Mason Plumlee's legit backup center.
*  Like they nailed the off season,
*  given what they had to work with.
*  I think they're gonna be a pretty goddamn good
*  regular season team.
*  My concern is just how small they are
*  and I just don't know how you create
*  a good enough defense out of this roster.
*  We didn't even mention Bud.
*  That's a huge hire for them.
*  Bud is a really good regular season coach.
*  He's a good coach, period.
*  And he's been an even better defensive coach
*  than offensive coach.
*  Motivated, Bud.
*  He's motivated.
*  He's ready.
*  I think they're a dangerous,
*  oh, we could, like the Suns are the three seed.
*  That's interesting.
*  The Suns are like two games out of the two seed
*  with two weeks left to play.
*  I think that's totally in play.
*  Yeah, the Suns are 20 and three.
*  I can't believe they started out this hot.
*  20 and three, I don't know.
*  If we had a weirdo first 20 game team,
*  they're definitely one of the candidates.
*  But I just don't know how sustainable it is
*  over, like you said, the number of games it takes
*  to make a legit, deep playoff run
*  and I don't know defensively just how they
*  raise their ceiling to a level they're gonna need it to be.
*  Well, and then how much they're leaning on Durant
*  to be a two-way guy at this stage.
*  I mean, Durant, that 07 draft,
*  were you even writing basketball in 07?
*  No, no.
*  Like think how long ago that was.
*  My son wasn't even born during the 2007 draft
*  and he just drove out of my driveway this morning.
*  That's how old Kevin Durant is.
*  And has some injury stuff on him too.
*  I felt bad for him with the foot on the line.
*  What was the foot on the line thing where everybody went back?
*  There was a football game.
*  Something happened in football that reminded people of that.
*  The first football game of the year.
*  Isaiah Leckley's foot was on the line.
*  It was like, oh, here we go with 24 hours of Durant stuff.
*  But everyone had the same thought
*  and that became his legacy in Brooklyn was that his,
*  and by the way, his foot was,
*  I went back and watched it, his foot was really on the line.
*  Have you gone back and watched that game ever?
*  No, I would like to at some point.
*  It's a fascinating one because they basically have the game
*  and regulation if they can just make one more play
*  and they can't and it gets the OT
*  and Katie's just dead at that point
*  and they can't get any more offense.
*  But I kind of forgotten.
*  I've been watching, I always do this during the summer.
*  I watch some old games just to get my brain
*  ready for the season.
*  But also I was on an airplane on Saturday
*  and they were running 2006 game six,
*  Miami Dallas for the finals.
*  A game that I don't think I've watched
*  since I wrote about it.
*  And it was riveting.
*  And you can't believe how many missed threes there were.
*  How many just wide open guys just bricking.
*  It's like, there's Jason Williams for three.
*  That's off the mark.
*  Gary Payton from three, off the mark.
*  And just people bricking threes.
*  But Alonzo Mourning was the key to that game.
*  Came in, he blocked like five shots and was like a maniac.
*  And Wade was incredible.
*  And then I went on a whole Wade kick and I'm like,
*  Wade's the most underrated star of the 21st century.
*  That's where I circled back on JetBlue on a Saturday night.
*  Are you tapping the guy next to you,
*  just being like, well, maybe there was nobody next to you.
*  What about fucking Wade?
*  Yeah, like Dwayne Wade, most underrated.
*  Not even properly rated.
*  Year three Dwayne Wade?
*  He got to the free throw line like 20 times.
*  But the part I forgot was they're up three,
*  they foul Wade, he misses both free throws.
*  Dallas gets the ball back for another three
*  and Terry misses it and Miami wins.
*  But that Miami team was like,
*  just a team we'll never see again.
*  Where it's Antoine Walker, Eudonnis Haslem,
*  who's awesome in that game.
*  Mourning and Shaq, they're just playing like big guys
*  everywhere with Dwayne Wade.
*  They washed up Gary Payton.
*  It's just a team that resembles no team
*  we would watch in 2024.
*  So let's talk about the foot on the line game again.
*  Because it's framed as this ultimate what if moment.
*  And I think the assumption baked into that framing is that,
*  well, if that's a three, the Nets win the series
*  and the Nets then win the championship.
*  And if they win the championship,
*  what does that mean for this hardened Kyrie Durant core
*  that then flames out so spectacularly just a season later?
*  And I get why it's framed that way
*  because the next round they're gonna play the Hawks
*  who are this upstart.
*  How did the Hawks get here?
*  Oh, that's right.
*  They've been so busy.
*  They're gonna be the Hawks.
*  And then the next round is the Suns
*  who are just kind of like surprised,
*  not surprised, but like they just got way better
*  than people expected way faster.
*  But people, I think, just skip a little bit,
*  just scoot on by the fact that Kyrie was out
*  with an ankle injury.
*  Remember he landed on Middleton's foot,
*  I think, turned his ankle.
*  He wasn't in that game.
*  Is he coming back?
*  And Harden was playing on one leg
*  and he was giving them a ton of credit.
*  He was giving them everything he had.
*  He was huge in game six to get that to game seven.
*  Playing on one leg.
*  And your guy Joe Harris was basically dead.
*  That was the other piece.
*  He was not making a lot of shots.
*  He could not make literally anything.
*  So what state are the Nets in
*  if they do get through that series?
*  And do they have enough to win eight more playoff games
*  against opponents that, yeah,
*  no one is gonna really remember that Hawks team
*  is like this playoff juggernaut.
*  See, I never thought of it as a Nets title
*  because the title probably already went out the window
*  and those guys all got hurt.
*  To me it was a Durant legacy thing.
*  Just a Durant thing?
*  Just the what ifs of that career,
*  which I think he probably has the most what ifs of anybody
*  because there's an alternate universe
*  where he's in year 18 on the Seattle Supersonics
*  and he's the most popular athlete in Seattle history.
*  There's the what if of the Klay Thompson game.
*  There's the what if of.
*  I can't go down this one with you.
*  I can't.
*  It's just too deep.
*  It just never ends.
*  These are four massive.
*  2019, he is the best player in the league
*  and it's not close.
*  And he's tearing through the playoffs
*  when he just gets hurt in that Clipper game.
*  And then the 21 thing with the foot in the line,
*  which if he had beaten the Bucs by himself,
*  that would have been amazing.
*  That would have, you wouldn't have been able
*  to say shit about him.
*  So yeah, it's, you know, I'm obviously been accused
*  of being a Durant defender and I'll admit to it.
*  I think his, I don't think there's ever been a forward
*  like him and I just think his career,
*  some of it self-inflicted.
*  He's totally, he's one of a kind.
*  And just terrible bad luck.
*  And then we watch him in the Olympics
*  and people are like, oh, Kevin Durant is amazing.
*  It's like, yeah, he's been amazing this whole time.
*  Anyway, we are going to take this to your podcast.
*  I think in two weeks.
*  Something like that.
*  And think of some other, some other gimmick.
*  By then camp will be going on.
*  Media day will happen.
*  Everyone will be.
*  Branding income trades.
*  I'm saying there's no branding income trade by then.
*  If you were Denver, you wouldn't,
*  you wouldn't have at least a meeting about Porter
*  for Brandon Ingram.
*  You wouldn't get the staff together.
*  Hush, hush.
*  Just be like, can we talk this out for three hours?
*  I would get the staff together.
*  I think that's a get the staff together at least.
*  What about the Pelicans?
*  You, you buy, you have that with the Zion injury possibility.
*  I don't know.
*  I kind of, I kind of like Porter.
*  We all know what Ingram needs to do to be, to be functionally
*  a number two or number three on a great team,
*  which is just shoot more threes and play better defense.
*  And like, that's just like, he doesn't,
*  hasn't played that way in the last couple of years.
*  He plays like, like the Rosen and Durant and Kobe
*  and the mid range gods, which he is just not quite
*  at that level offensively.
*  Although he's really, really good.
*  I think he's actually become a little underrated
*  because the most recent memory of him is just getting
*  smothered by the thunder coming right off of an injury.
*  And I think Brandingham is pretty goddamn good,
*  but yeah, he's got to, even if he stays on the Pelicans,
*  he's got to do those things.
*  And we just haven't seen that stuff anyway.
*  He's a fear of me of mine as with the Miami Heat,
*  cause I just feel like they're sitting there waiting.
*  They purposely did nothing.
*  They're just kind of sitting there and they could go
*  in 19 different directions, including in the tank
*  where all of a sudden, Butler's unhappy.
*  How bad do the heat have to get?
*  And I'm not saying the heat are going to be bad.
*  I said last week on my podcast, like, I think the heat
*  are even a little better than people give them credit for.
*  But I'm just from your standpoint,
*  when do you stop being scared of the heat?
*  If they're like five and 30 in three years.
*  It's like the Friday the 13th part nine movie
*  where you're still kind of scared of Voorhees.
*  He's got like a pot belly.
*  His head's been chopped off twice.
*  Nah, I'm still a little afraid of him.
*  Plus they still have Bam.
*  They still have a top four coach.
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't be afraid of this team.
*  I just feel like you're very scarred by the heat Celtics
*  battles of the past 15 years.
*  I still cannot believe Tatum sprained his ankle
*  on the first play of that game seven.
*  I just want to know what the alternate universe is
*  if he doesn't sprain his ankle in that game.
*  What happens?
*  It was a bummer of a game.
*  It was a bummer.
*  All right, yeah, we'll do this again in a couple weeks
*  on the old low post.
*  Zach low, great to see you glad as well.
*  Can't wait to see on ESPN talking about the Lakers.
*  Sure, there'll be some segments.
*  And I'll see you on your podcast in a couple weeks.
*  No comments.
*  See you soon.
*  Yeah.
