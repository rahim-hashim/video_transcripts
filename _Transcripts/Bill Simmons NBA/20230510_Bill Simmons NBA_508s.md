# Is the Title Window Closing for This Core of Celtics Players? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixC6QNqyUxM)
*  All right.
*  Here's the bigger thing with the Missoula thing because they make the
*  finals last year and it's a, it's almost a year too early in the sense that,
*  wow, I thought this was going to be a year.
*  I didn't realize it was going to be this year.
*  We've been in the finals.
*  I remember comparing it to then 1996 Patriots, which had this really talented
*  team that felt like it was a year away and all of a sudden they were in the
*  Superbowl and then you assume, oh, we'll be back.
*  And, you know, the next year that Pats team, they lose and the, I think the
*  first round and then it quickly fell apart.
*  I'm not saying that's going to happen to Celtics team, but there is a title
*  window piece to this where last year it felt like they were going to steal the
*  title, right?
*  Like because, because of Minnilton's situation and it felt like Milwaukee was
*  headed for back to back, they somehow get by Milwaukee.
*  Then they, they survived this incredible Miami collapse where they're up what 14
*  minutes, three and a half minutes left to almost lose the game.
*  It comes out of Jimmy Butler three.
*  And then it's the Warriors.
*  It felt like after game one, oh my God, we're, we actually could steal the title
*  here and then Curry became Curry.
*  They lose in six, but it's like, all right, this is good.
*  Well, who's better than the Celtics this upcoming year?
*  Nobody's better.
*  There's teams that are as good.
*  And then the season goes along and you're like, Whoa, the West is a mess.
*  Right.
*  Milwaukee, something seems a little off with them.
*  Philly looks okay.
*  But the Celtics have the most talent and Milwaukee loses in round one.
*  And you think what the season fucking parted, they're going to play the
*  winner of the heat and Nick's just have to get by the Sixers team and beat as a
*  bad knee.
*  Now they're down three, two.
*  And if it doesn't happen this year, I just think the, I don't know if you're
*  going to have a better chance than you had last year and this year, especially
*  with the salaries, with the way they were able to stack stuff with the Jaylen's
*  only making 25 million, the CBA is changing.
*  You might get stale with this nucleus, which we're going to talk about in a
*  second, but I really worry about the title window.
*  KOC.
*  I think even though these guys are young, isn't that fair to be like, Holy shit.
*  Are we missing our window completely here?
*  I mean, they're, they're young, but they've been around a long time and they've
*  been through a lot of battles together.
*  Like I think with Jaylen Brown, you're, you're nearing the point that you're
*  near the end of his, you know, like you said, his second deal.
*  He, if he doesn't get the all NBA, he could very well test free agency in 2024.
*  Horford's older, right?
*  He's 36 years old.
*  He's going to be 37 next year.
*  And you got Brogdon over 30.
*  He's getting picked apart on defense by Philadelphia.
*  Marcus smart, not the same right now.
*  This year on defense, as he was last year, already one defensive player of the year.
*  He's fallen off a bit now, 30 years old.
*  Like there's a, like there's age for certain players and there's free agency
*  for others.
*  I think, I think for Boston, it's definitely a case where maybe the, maybe
*  this core's window is shutting.
*  It's now just a matter of how do they pivot this core to extend it and into the
*  future, because we don't know what's going to end up happening with a Jaylen Brown
*  at this point, whether he leaves, wants to go, or just ends up inking a super max
*  contract and whether that is value or not remains to be seen.
*  I love Jaylen Brown, but he's, you know, the 15th to 20th best player in the
*  league, he's not a top five, top 10 guy.
*  And when you're paying that enormous amount of money, that changes things
*  under the new CBA, where if you enter into now with this new CBA, if you're a
*  luxury luxury tax team, that's $7 million over, you have your typical penalties.
*  But if you're 17 and a half million dollars over at this point, you know,
*  that the second apron that they installed, you can't trade.
*  Pick seven years into the future.
*  You can't do sign and trades.
*  You can't give up cash and deals and so on and so forth.
*  There's a long list of penalties.
*  So make me for Boston.
*  That's where you that's where you enter.
*  That's true for Milwaukee.
*  That's true for Golden State.
*  It's true for potentially Boston.
*  A lot of teams around the league where when the money gets that big, it really
*  limits your ability to use exceptions like you can't use your taxpayer mid-level
*  exception, assign players.
*  You're limited to minimums.
*  It's restricted.
*  So I think for Boston, they're one of those teams in those buckets where it's
*  at a point, it's a pivot point where it could extend.
*  But maybe you have to take a slight step back as well.
*  Yeah.
*  And I guess that then you're thinking, what's our core?
*  What's our ceiling?
*  Can Tatum be somebody who's a connector in the way that, you know, somebody like
*  Jokic is what is he, is he at that top level or is he like right underneath
*  the Brazil and I were talking about that on Sunday.
*  So he just kind of right underneath that one B level, not a one A.
*  Might be, might be.
*  And then, and the Jalen piece, you know, as, as we've discussed on this pod a few
*  times, ever since the KD trade rumors, it's never felt totally right.
*  There's been breadcrumbs dropped all over the place.
*  Our own, our guy, Logan Murdock, wrote a great feature about him.
*  There's been a couple of weird interviews with him now.
*  And even like during the series where he had that little bit of a ladeg about
*  usually when the balls of my hands, good things happen or whatever, we're just
*  talking about how he didn't have any shots and, uh, OT offense wasn't the issue
*  in that game though, I didn't think.
*  No, I agree.
*  No, is it the, well, if he had just stayed on, uh, hard end, at least it would
*  have gone to the last shot in the overtime.
*  I don't think, I think Jalen's here and I think they're going to pay him.
*  And I think they're going to figure out after they pay him a year later, I think
*  short term, if this team gets bounced on Thursday, um, it might be the end for
*  the smart era and Robert Williams would be the other one that I think has got a
*  really tradable contract.
*  He's been a huge disappointment, huge in the playoffs.
*  He's not on defense.
*  My dad's, my dad's claims.
*  He went to a game like four weeks ago and he hurt his knee again and that they're
*  not being honest about it, but he doesn't look even 50% is impactful, right?
*  Mm hmm.
*  He's not like the flying around crazy Robert Williams anymore.
*  He still does these basic, basic, basic, you know, he'll have this great defensive
*  possession and then he'll let up for a second.
*  All of a sudden his guy's shooting a 50 wide open 15 footer and you're like,
*  why did you stop playing?
*  You just played hard for eight seconds.
*  Then the last two seconds you gave up an open jumper.
*  My, you know, he's got a tradable contract.
*  I wonder if they would try to trade those guys together.
*  Um, smart has a hold over this team that we talked about on Sunday where the, and
*  I don't even know if it's totally his fault, but the ball always seems to find
*  him in the biggest moments.
*  It just does.
*  Like you think about that game seven against Miami last year, just over and
*  over again, he was taking the right shot.
*  It was a wide open shot, but I also didn't want him to take it.
*  And it might be one of those situations where he's almost over.
*  He's under qualified for the role.
*  He thinks he should have, but he's kind of overqualified for the role that he
*  probably should have.
*  So my guess is that that would be somebody this summer, but again, they could
*  win on Thursday and they could win this weekend and all of a sudden it'd be the
*  favorites to make the finals again.
*  Right?
*  Sure.
*  I mean, Doc Rivers has blown three, three, one leads in his coaching career.
*  He's blown three, three, two leads in his coaching career and five other one
*  Oh two Oh, or two one leads.
*  It's not like he's been up before and hasn't blown leads.
*  It's just none of those have happened against a rookie head coach.
*  I like for the Celtics here with Missoula.
*  Like we're talking about some of his weaknesses.
*  It's also like you said, Rob Williams is something definitely is up.
*  Like he has explosive moments, but he's playing only like the
*  proof is in the minutes per game.
*  He's playing 25, 30 minutes against the Warriors in the finals.
*  He's ending last season playing 30 plus minutes per game over the last couple of
*  months.
*  He is not, you know, he was hurt this year.
*  He's playing 15, 20 minutes per game.
*  They're clearly limiting him purposely.
*  Like this isn't this is like that's all the evidence you need compared to his use
*  of 19 minutes tonight.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's it goes without saying, like with the minutes and never mind, like
*  when you really watch the effort waiver for him.
