# Indiana’s Incredible Run, Next Knicks Moves and ‘Inside the NBA’ Fears | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=0.0s)]
*  Ryan, so it's here Sunday morning, June 1st, 2025. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=26.4s)]
*  I was getting a little sad in June. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=33.8s)]
*  Marcello means we're headed toward only so many basketball games left. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=35.12s)]
*  The draft free agency football's a little bit away. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=39.96s)]
*  Couple good UFC events. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Um, summer slam, you miss March PGA, not that two PGA left British, British open [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  that they now call the open. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=53.64s)]
*  And then, uh, what's the other one that's left? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  There's one more us open. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  G H O no us open. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=61.08s)]
*  So there's some sports stuff left, but I always get sad because we're [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=63.24s)]
*  just running out of basketball. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=65.68s)]
*  And we had one of the most fascinating. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=67.16s)]
*  Playoff results. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=72.04s)]
*  I can remember the Indiana Pacers making the finals 28 to one before the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=72.84s)]
*  playoffs to make it Pascal Siakam was 65 to one to be the finals MVP. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=77.44s)]
*  This is one of the biggest aberration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=82.48s)]
*  We've made the finals teams that we've had certainly since I've known you, but [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=85.4s)]
*  even going back even to when we were kids, and yet I feel like it's the right result. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=90.08s)]
*  I feel like they were the best team. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=94.56s)]
*  And I think they would have beaten Boston even with no Tatum injury. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=96.84s)]
*  I think this would have been a bad matchup. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=101.44s)]
*  If you throw in zombie, poor Zingas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=103.0s)]
*  I just think they would have beaten them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=104.6s)]
*  Anyway, your thoughts on the Pacers headed to the finals. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=105.96s)]
*  Thought it'd be a close series between them and New York. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  Wasn't a hundred percent sure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=111.4s)]
*  Pick the Pacers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=112.44s)]
*  And then as you saw it play out, there was just another gear that they get to that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  The Knicks aren't capable of, and certainly with Brunson's offensive ability. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=119.64s)]
*  And then the Bogey gets it going, you know, bridges. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=123.04s)]
*  I think everybody's a little too down on them knowing how important [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=126.12s)]
*  it was in that Boston series. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=128.96s)]
*  So I know that there's like a Knicks O bit that we're probably going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=130.8s)]
*  to be doing a little bit later. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=133.56s)]
*  And then when you watch the whole thing play out, it's not like it's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=135.32s)]
*  the whole thing play out. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=137.52s)]
*  It's like when the Pacers really get rolling, they, they felt like, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=138.4s)]
*  I mean, this is not a fluke. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  They're the better basketball team of these two teams. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=143.44s)]
*  And the fact that you can dig into some of this next stuff with the starters. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  And you always had the cat or Brunson option to attack where when you get [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=149.36s)]
*  Halliburton going and once he starts seeing like what you want to do, like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=154.24s)]
*  his familiarity with the opponent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=158.08s)]
*  And this will come into some of the finals preview stuff. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=160.4s)]
*  Like once he starts getting to play the same team over and over again for that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  guy and how brilliant he is as a player, like you're just going to be at a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=166.28s)]
*  disadvantage because of his size and his passing and then, you know, once he [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=169.6s)]
*  starts adding the shot in there, I can't believe just to be honest, I can't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=172.76s)]
*  believe Siakam won Eastern Conference finals MVP over, over Halliburton. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=176.44s)]
*  This one, I was as surprised as Halliburton who took a step forward, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=180.16s)]
*  grabbed the trophy and it wasn't his. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=182.88s)]
*  I thought it was dead even except for the part that he made one of the crazy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=185.12s)]
*  shots in recent playoff history. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=188.72s)]
*  And I thought that was going to swing it down because of that game one, three [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=190.88s)]
*  plus, cause Siakam was awesome in game two, awesome in game four and awesome [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=194.56s)]
*  in game six and so in three of the four plus with the Turner foul trouble, they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=198.32s)]
*  really needed him to defend towns. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=203.0s)]
*  So I see the case. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=205.04s)]
*  I would have voted for Halliburton. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=206.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=208.2s)]
*  And Siakam who, you know, after game one, I was really down on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think with Siakam, my history is that at times it's harder for him to get [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=213.24s)]
*  it going on his own on the other side of things where he's such a perfect fit for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=219.16s)]
*  this Pacers team when Siakam gets out on the break and you think you have the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=222.84s)]
*  angle on him because he's so big and he, he maps out his steps perfectly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  And there's this, this Euro thing and his strides are so long. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=233.96s)]
*  He's unbelievable. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=237.36s)]
*  Lay up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=238.4s)]
*  He does off the Euro step. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=238.76s)]
*  I think there's like three people in the league who have that move. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=240.28s)]
*  And you can think like, Oh, this guy doesn't dribble that much and it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=243.52s)]
*  doesn't really matter and he's just perfect for what the Pacers want to do [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=247.0s)]
*  when they want to get out on the break. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=250.2s)]
*  I just thought between Halliburton's game one heroics, which really was more [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=251.36s)]
*  knee Smith, his basically flawless game four, I mean, 32, 15 and 12 zero [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=255.56s)]
*  turnovers and then game six, the second half, especially when he decided to put [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=263.12s)]
*  this thing away last night, it was him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=268.92s)]
*  And I think the voters like looked at three point percentage. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=271.68s)]
*  Those that voted for Siakam and went, all right, you know, he, he, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=275.24s)]
*  Siakam lit it up from three. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=278.92s)]
*  I'll give it to him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=280.16s)]
*  And I just, there's too many times of these finals and conference finals, MVP [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  awards where I think it's too much. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=284.56s)]
*  Stat counting on the votes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=286.56s)]
*  And you're not really looking like who at this time through six games was the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=288.88000000000005s)]
*  most valuable to the team. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=292.72s)]
*  And it's, it's almost like a quarterback a bit with Halliburton. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=294.68s)]
*  So I'm probably too biased for somebody who's just in control of all these [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  possessions, uh, the same way with Tatum and Jaylen Brown and the Easter [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=300.48s)]
*  conference finals, I was like, well, that's the thing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=304.0s)]
*  So I felt the same way. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  And I thought Siakam was incredible, especially some of the stuff he did [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=309.0s)]
*  defensively and the intensity and just how much, how many miles he was covering [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  and the speed he was playing at. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=318.56s)]
*  It never seemed like he got tired. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  I thought he was incredible. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Um, I'm just, I'm on record. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=322.96s)]
*  I felt this way last year with Tatum and Brown in the Eastern finals. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=325.0s)]
*  Like the best part of the team should always win this award. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  Unless it is so clear that somebody else was so much more impactful than them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=331.64s)]
*  Um, that's the only time I can see it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=336.96s)]
*  Like you can even go back over the course of history with some of the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  finals, MVPs, I just don't agree with some of them, you know, it's, it's not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=341.2s)]
*  like who is slightly better than somebody else on a team at some point. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  You have to grandfather in the importance of the best guy on a team to what that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=349.68s)]
*  team does game after game after game. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=353.76s)]
*  And Halliburton is the best guy in this team. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  It's his team, the pace they play. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=357.52s)]
*  It's it belongs to him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=360.52s)]
*  It's like, it's almost like in the Superbowl, we don't go, Oh yeah, maybe [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=362.0s)]
*  the quarterback wasn't the most important today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=365.84s)]
*  Maybe it was the receiver. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=367.88s)]
*  We always give it to the quarterback unless they were terrible or they [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=369.08s)]
*  don't have the stats, but in basketball, we don't do this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  212 yards receiving three touchdowns. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, like there are certainly cases and I think you probably, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=378.84s)]
*  five sacks and the defense gives up three points and you're like, all right, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=382.0s)]
*  maybe that, maybe that defensive end should have won it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  But for the most part we give it to the QB cause they're the most important player. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=388.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=391.88s)]
*  And I think you would get heat for saying like somebody should be grandfathered [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  in based on their status. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=395.12s)]
*  And I know that's not what you're saying. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=396.04s)]
*  You're saying over the course of two weeks, like Tatum being in control of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  every single possession should matter. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=400.8s)]
*  And I'll never get over 2015 with Iguodala getting it over Curry. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=402.88s)]
*  Curry's the only reason they're winning that series, the only Cleveland's injuries. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=407.48s)]
*  But the, to have Steph get double teamed and then kind of figure out the double [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=411.52s)]
*  team and then everything kind of opens up around it and they're like, yeah, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=416.04s)]
*  but he would all had to defend LeBron. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=419.64s)]
*  I just, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=421.64s)]
*  I know seven was terrible where it's like, okay, he, he, he scored. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=422.24s)]
*  They swept. He had a lot of points. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=426.0s)]
*  Duncan's the best player in the league. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=428.08s)]
*  He's the whole reason they're there. He's the guy in the meetings. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=430.88s)]
*  Cleveland's like, we got to figure out this Tim Duncan thing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=434.0s)]
*  This one is not nearly as egregious. I was just surprised because after game one, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  you're right. See Ockham and you know, he's just, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=443.56s)]
*  there are times with him where I'm like, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=447.12s)]
*  is he initiating anything on his own? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=448.68s)]
*  I feel like there's really long gaps with the way he comes out in game two, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  because clearly he probably felt like he left a lot on the table in game one. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. He starts getting right. Like when you're hitting step backs into OG, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  then I'm like, okay, here we go. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=461.56s)]
*  Uh, you could see at the beginning of game two where he, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  he clearly like went to bed, thought about it and was like, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  I got to come out and be a lot more aggressive. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=469.56s)]
*  So I don't think this one's as egregious to those two things. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  Didn't you think about it was six minutes left when it felt like the Pacers [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  might win. I did think to myself, huh, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=477.88s)]
*  this would be an interesting finals MVP vote. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  Cause we only have nine people voting. It's not like they have a hundred. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=482.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Nine people. You only need five to vote for one side. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  And that's what happened with Siakam. He went five to four. Yeah. It was fine. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=488.56s)]
*  I was, I didn't think he was going to win. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=491.92s)]
*  Can I tell you, can I give you a bigger picture thing on this? Yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=494.68s)]
*  I don't think we should give away the conference finals MVP. I don't like it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=498.16s)]
*  I just don't like it. I think it, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=502.36s)]
*  I think it works against everything that like that Pacers story, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  the thing they did with their team, how selfless they were, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=508.96s)]
*  um, how awesome that team was to watch for three rounds. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=512.84s)]
*  And then you have to like basically give somebody a trophy and doesn't, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=516.08s)]
*  you were the most important. Here's your trophy. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=519.16s)]
*  I didn't like it last year with the Celtics either. I don't, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=521.4s)]
*  I don't like it in general. And I don't really understand the point of this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=523.96s)]
*  Like if you were going to tell me the Eastern conference playoffs MVP, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=527.16s)]
*  that's a little more interesting, right? It's like, Hey, for the first three rounds, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=531.64s)]
*  here's, this would be a better kind of capturing of who mattered the most for [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=535.36s)]
*  the first three rounds. But when you go to a series, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=540.24s)]
*  then you end up with dumb shit like this, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=542.5200000000001s)]
*  where Halliburton is clearly the most important guy on the team. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=544.2s)]
*  It'd be like in the mid two thousands. If, if it was like, yep, Nash, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  Nash wasn't the, the Western conference finals MVP. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  It was actually Raja Bell was actually Sean Marion. It's like, no, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=556.2s)]
*  it's Nash's team. He should win unless he was absolutely terrible. Anyway, uh, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm just not a fan. Yeah. I mean, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=565.4000000000001s)]
*  the NBA clearly made a push here for more awards and to name the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=567.48s)]
*  greats of the past. And so that's fine. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  I thought the Larry Bird Eastern conference playoffs MVP. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=575.6400000000001s)]
*  I can't get worked up about this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=579.96s)]
*  I mean, um, how did Indy pull this off? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  Have a theory on top of how good they were. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  And they beat a 64 win team and they beat Yanis. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  So the Knicks were relatively new with these five guys, right. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=592.28s)]
*  And just their style and they're only playing seven guys. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=595.36s)]
*  Everybody's playing big minutes. They want to play slower. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=598.0s)]
*  If you look at some of the, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=600.64s)]
*  especially look at game two of that Celtic series, that's just the kind of, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=601.8s)]
*  it was like 91 90. That's what the Knicks, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=605.68s)]
*  the lower the score is the better it is for the Knicks slower. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=607.88s)]
*  The game goes better. It is for the Knicks. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=610.24s)]
*  And you have all of the sample size of studying the Knicks and the Pacers were [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=612.68s)]
*  clearly like, we're going to run. This team doesn't play enough guys. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=616.36s)]
*  They don't want to play this pace. They don't get back on defense. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  They have two liabilities. We have to keep pushing the pace, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=623.92s)]
*  keep pushing the pace. It was almost like in football. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=627.24s)]
*  When somebody's like this, this team only has four guys in the D line. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=630.2s)]
*  The more plays we run, the more they keep them on the field. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=634.72s)]
*  They're going to wear down as the game went along. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=637.04s)]
*  And I felt like that's what happened over the course of the series game five, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  New York comes back. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=641.72s)]
*  Indy's not really running. They're not playing with the same pace game six. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=644.52s)]
*  They ramp up the defensive pressure. They're taking off after every break. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=647.56s)]
*  They're just running, running, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=650.64s)]
*  running, trying to put them on their heels and the Knicks couldn't handle it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=651.4799999999999s)]
*  And we're going to talk about the Knicks later when the van comes on. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=655.28s)]
*  But I do think that's a real flaw for them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=658.8399999999999s)]
*  And I look back to round two at the Celtics in those first two games and it's [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  just, they played right into the Knicks hands. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  We're going to walk it up and launch a bunch of threes. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=667.2399999999999s)]
*  The Knicks are like, that's great. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  Cause when, once we get close to the end of the game, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  we're actually going to have a better chance to execute. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=673.52s)]
*  And the Pacers were just like, we're going to do the opposite chaotic, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=675.48s)]
*  go nuts. We're going to wear you guys out. And it worked. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=679.4s)]
*  And I just thought it was really, really brilliant how they attacked it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=683.16s)]
*  I really, really appreciated it. Respected it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=686.64s)]
*  The pace part of it is just so alarming when it starts like getting away from [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=690.28s)]
*  you and I don't know who made the comment, but I had noticed it before where, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=694.64s)]
*  you know, I went to replace something and then off the top of the list, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=699.72s)]
*  I'm going to go, what's this? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=703.76s)]
*  I'm going to go and get the ball. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=704.92s)]
*  And then I'm going to go back to the game and I'm going to do something and then [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=706.16s)]
*  I'll fast forward, like in the downtime where, you know, like, okay, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=710.64s)]
*  that's out of bounds. I can jump ahead 10 seconds. I don't, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=714.48s)]
*  I don't need all of this stuff with the Pacers games. You can't do it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=717.72s)]
*  No, because you'll miss, like you'll hit fast forward on something where you [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=721.16s)]
*  think it's dead. If I'm behind, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=724.24s)]
*  the next thing you know, right. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=727.64s)]
*  Next thing I know, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=729.24s)]
*  like two guys and the Pacers are getting back on defense after a make pointing [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=729.84s)]
*  every other game that you're still going to be fast forwarding before the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=732.96s)]
*  inbounds. Right. And the number of transition buckets, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  which shouldn't happen after makes like of all the things you could be [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=740.48s)]
*  disappointed, disappointed about with the Knicks, which generally on this season, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=744.12s)]
*  I'm not disappointed with the Knicks at all. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  I thought this was a really good season and we'll get to 11 playoff games. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=749.6s)]
*  Exactly. Uh, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=754.2s)]
*  the thing I think is really frustrating and it's, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=756.48s)]
*  it's something that's happening at the NBA level. That's weird. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=758.52s)]
*  I remember how like back courts all of a sudden, just overnight, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=760.88s)]
*  it just felt like overnight, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  nobody cared about these dangerous potential back court passes. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=764.52s)]
*  I never remember seeing that for 40 years of watching the NBA. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=768.84s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, like a couple of years ago, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=771.96s)]
*  it just decided guys were like, yeah, I don't care. Like maybe he's back court. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=773.76s)]
*  And then we'll see what happens. Right. Um, something else that, you know, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=777.52s)]
*  you know, very early on in whether it's, you're playing or watching it is that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=781.72s)]
*  on the shooter side, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=787.72s)]
*  if you're going up against a team that runs like the opposite deep player, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=789.76s)]
*  not meaning deep to the basket, but deep back to the half court line, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=794.84s)]
*  but he has to be completely locked in makes or misses to combat the Pacers in [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=798.2s)]
*  this case, their guy leaking out and wanting to run every single time. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  And you would think safety who has to make sure nobody's going to get behind [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  them. Yeah. Like never come up and help and run support. You have to. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=814.32s)]
*  And so if the other guy is shooting, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=817.64s)]
*  that's on you because it's really hard on the shooter being the furthest away to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=819.72s)]
*  then try to get back into transistors defense. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=824.76s)]
*  But sometimes that's going to be on you. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=827.6s)]
*  And so wherever that communication break down, it's like, Hey, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=829.12s)]
*  you have to be the person that gets back. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  You'd think you'd get more familiar when you're playing the Pacers every other [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=833.84s)]
*  night. And the Knicks never got more from like that must've drove Tibbs in this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=837.44s)]
*  whenever I know probably put them. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=842.44s)]
*  So the pain of watching the tape of all of this stuff, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=843.72s)]
*  the number of times that kept happening. It's like, look, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=846.32s)]
*  even if we're going to lose, let's stop letting them do that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=848.72s)]
*  They were throwing like end zone corner fades on some of these things going [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=851.52s)]
*  like, I assume Toppin is going to win. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. Like there were times the Pacers guys were catching it and it wasn't even [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=860.16s)]
*  in stride. It was just like, throw it up there, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=863.84s)]
*  our guy will win the ball and then let's see what happens. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=866.76s)]
*  They even do this to Thomas Bryant. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=869.52s)]
*  He had a couple of those where he's just like stumbling toward the basket, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=871.88s)]
*  hoping to get fouled. Thomas Bryant, sneaky, all time teammate. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=875.04s)]
*  That dude was happy last night. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=878.6s)]
*  He is, you know, it's interesting that Turner said at one point, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=880.72s)]
*  I've been playing against that guy since AAU and I forgot he was kind of a good [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=884.28s)]
*  prospect. He's had an interesting bounce around career. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=888.6s)]
*  Um, and then basically because Tony Bradley gets hurt, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=892.68s)]
*  he ends up being one of the stars of a, of game six. Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=896.4000000000001s)]
*  They used all of the next weaknesses against them. Townsend Robinson. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=900.1600000000001s)]
*  You're going to play them to getting a lot of rebounds, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  but you're going to be really slow getting back. Right. Um, Brunson, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  if you're going to have a guy who's this ball dominant and you're not going to [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=910.0400000000001s)]
*  have a lot of assists in a game and everything's going to run through one guy, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=913.44s)]
*  well, we're going to make him fucking work 94 feet. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=916.72s)]
*  We're just going to throw guys at him. But your guy, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=919.84s)]
*  Nemhard who I felt like as the first half was going along, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  it felt like he was going to become the key of the game because knee Smith [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=927.32s)]
*  wasn't right. Knee Smith was hurt. You can see it. He wasn't the same guy. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=930.72s)]
*  And they needed Nemhard for Brunson, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=934.88s)]
*  but it didn't seem like he trusted his own shot and the Knicks were just [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=938.2800000000001s)]
*  leaving them open. I think it was two for seven in the first half, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=941.44s)]
*  but all the shots were wide open and the Knicks were clearly like, Hey, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=944.4000000000001s)]
*  Nemhard knock yourself out. Go ahead. Take, do you want to drive and get that? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=948.08s)]
*  Low 15 footer. We're giving it to you. You were going to leave you up in the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=953.28s)]
*  corner. And he had to step up in the second half. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=956.16s)]
*  I hate to do the ESPN halftime. You got them hurts. Gotta step up. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=960.04s)]
*  But he had to step up offensively because they had to keep them out there. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=964.1999999999999s)]
*  Not only did he step up, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=967.52s)]
*  he took over the game against Brunson defensively in a way that for two years, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=969.56s)]
*  he wasn't able to do. It was like, it was almost like, like he unlocked something. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=973.8s)]
*  And he started frustrating Brunson when Brunson headbutted them and they didn't [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=978.4399999999999s)]
*  see it. You knew the game was over. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=981.52s)]
*  So it was like, he got him. He broke them. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=983.52s)]
*  I bought a Nimhart t-shirt last night after the game. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't even care if it's cool or fashionable. I'm so, I'm, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=992.16s)]
*  I actually am mad it took us this long to talk about him. I don't care. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=996.72s)]
*  Look, he went six to 12. He ended up hitting a couple of late shots and it was [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  ugly early. He couldn't hit anything. He was open. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1004.12s)]
*  Couldn't end it for four games. You could tell a little bit. Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1007.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You could tell too. Like he was thinking about it. Like, all right, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1010.72s)]
*  let me settle in here. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1013.8000000000001s)]
*  The hitch before he took the wide open three. Yeah. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1015.28s)]
*  But what he had to do against Brunson in the absence of knee Smith. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1017.84s)]
*  And I always wonder, like, you're always sitting there thinking, Hey, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1022.24s)]
*  like what would you do against Brunson? Like, how do you handle this guy? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1025.04s)]
*  Whose handle is so tight? He has this low center of gravity. He's like a bull. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1028.6000000000001s)]
*  He's so strong. His footwork is perfect. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1033.2s)]
*  Just when you think you have them. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1036.4s)]
*  And then to add in his foul baiting stuff, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1037.68s)]
*  which is I'm not going to miss watching that. Um, because with, with Brunson, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  well with Brunson, it's not free throws. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1045.4s)]
*  It's if you really look, I don't know why I do this to myself because I appreciate [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1048.5600000000002s)]
*  him so much. And I really enjoyed that Sixers Nick series so much too. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1052.64s)]
*  But I also enjoyed both fan bases screaming about the other team star in [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1056.16s)]
*  working the game the way they do. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1061.16s)]
*  And certainly if it had been a Brunson SGA matchup, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1063.5600000000002s)]
*  like I was a little worried of, of like how that was going to be received. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1066.52s)]
*  But the problem with Brunson is that Brunson is doing it off of the ball. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1070.6399999999999s)]
*  He's doing it on inbounds. He's doing it whenever a screen is set. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1074.6s)]
*  Like he is trying to do it the entire game. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1078.8s)]
*  So if you decide you want to hate watch that part of it, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1081.56s)]
*  like I worked myself up into a lather a couple of games ago because I go like, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1084.72s)]
*  let me just keep track. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1088.44s)]
*  Like I have a Brunson bullshit tracker that I keep in my notes throughout the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1089.32s)]
*  entire course of a game to just be like, yeah, no, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1093.28s)]
*  it's that on eBay. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1095.8s)]
*  No ESPN has talked to me about it a bit after the heat index because the heat [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1097.04s)]
*  didn't have a very good playoff. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1101.6399999999999s)]
*  Try not maybe trying to sell it like a, yeah, that's interesting. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1102.48s)]
*  Yeah. Like a private company that's acquired or something like that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1106.24s)]
*  But so when I'm thinking about how hard it is deal with Brunson, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1109.0s)]
*  because then you're still waiting for him to get you and he's going to get the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  call. And at one point I was like, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1115.48s)]
*  maybe the best thing is just to be as physical as possible with them the entire [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1118.28s)]
*  time. And then you're like, well, that's isn't really going to work. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1123.16s)]
*  What Nemheart did, his physicality, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1126.6000000000001s)]
*  that inbounds play where Brunson pushed him first, Nemheart pushed him back. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1128.64s)]
*  The retaliator ends up Tyler Ford hits him. We love Tyler Ford, but I'm like, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1131.92s)]
*  Tyler, how could you do that after where Brunson kind of flops on the retaliation [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1135.68s)]
*  from Nemheart here? But like whatever Nemheart's approach was, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1140.4s)]
*  it was more about his mentality of like when he hit the layup and then gave [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1143.76s)]
*  Brunson the ball back before all this happened, where it's like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1148.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be here all fucking night. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1151.28s)]
*  I think Brunson had him psyched out for most of those two years. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1153.6s)]
*  And then last night he was like, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1157.48s)]
*  it was like the guy going after the guy who's been bullying him. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1159.08s)]
*  I was watching it. Obviously I'm on a couple of Celtics text threads talking [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1162.28s)]
*  about the, uh, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1166.4s)]
*  all the stuff the Celtics should have done in the last round. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1167.8s)]
*  And it's like all the stuff, the Pacers. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1170.04s)]
*  I thank you for leaving me off of those. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1172.0s)]
*  You're welcome. You're welcome. Um, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1173.76s)]
*  I'm watching the Pacers do all this stuff. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1176.8s)]
*  The Celtics had better personnel to do all the same stuff and they just didn't [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1179.44s)]
*  do it. Everything Indiana did to fuck with Brunson, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1184.48s)]
*  the Celtics could have done. They had better, better players. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1188.76s)]
*  You like Derek White couldn't have just done what Nemheart did yesterday and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1192.36s)]
*  just been like 94 feet. I'm following. I'm in your mug. I'm in your mug. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1195.48s)]
*  When you get over half court, I'm going to make you work. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1198.72s)]
*  Cause the key with Brunson is you got to, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1201.44s)]
*  you got to mess with them before he gets into the 20 feet near the basket. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1203.3999999999999s)]
*  It's gotta be the other 75 feet is where you have to get him, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1207.76s)]
*  make it hard for him to get the ball, make it like later in the shot clock, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1210.72s)]
*  and then just keep whipping guys and I'm keep making them try to get rid of the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1214.3999999999999s)]
*  ball basically. Cause the Knicks don't want to pass the ball. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1218.08s)]
*  I was looking it up. The Knit there, there was a, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1220.84s)]
*  you know that a stat head on basketball reference [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1224.76s)]
*  only like 15 teams have won at least 10 playoff games, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1229.24s)]
*  scored a hundred plus points and had less than 21 assists a game. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1233.3999999999999s)]
*  Like they don't share the ball. This was the, the Knicks ended up, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1238.24s)]
*  they were under 20 assists a game and they averaged almost 110 points a game. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1241.72s)]
*  They don't share the ball. They're ball dominant. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1246.12s)]
*  And it's like whoever gets the ball over half court, that guy has it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1248.96s)]
*  And the Pacers had to make it harder before they went into all their shit, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1251.72s)]
*  which is what they did. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1256.32s)]
*  And I'm sure Missoula was watching this going nuts. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1257.76s)]
*  I can't even imagine the regret of the first two games specifically. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1261.04s)]
*  I can't imagine the regret the Celtics had. They played it completely wrong. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1265.12s)]
*  They had the wrong game plan, everything in Indiana opposite. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1268.4399999999998s)]
*  What a win for Carlisle. I mean, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1273.12s)]
*  you think the 2011 finals is one of the great coaching out thinking [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1276.32s)]
*  four straight teams for four straight rounds, like runs. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1281.56s)]
*  Anyone's ever had built around one star and a pretty weird team. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1284.84s)]
*  And they just outthought everybody. And then he just did it again. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1288.68s)]
*  So now he's like, now he moved up the ladder historically, I think, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1292.72s)]
*  to make the finals with this team on top of the 2011 finals, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1296.24s)]
*  on top of the, uh, Oh, three pistons that almost made it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1299.96s)]
*  The Oh four Pacers that almost made it. The artists melee fucks up his chance to, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1304.32s)]
*  that team probably wins the title if that doesn't happen. Like this is now, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1308.68s)]
*  I think one of the four best coaches of the century. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1312.2s)]
*  I don't think that's hyperbole. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1315.44s)]
*  I don't think it is either because whenever you're talking to people that work [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1317.4s)]
*  on the NBA side of things, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1322.28s)]
*  the number of years where it's say it's like a summer going into the fall [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1324.44s)]
*  conversation, like, Hey, what's going on? You know, whatever. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1328.04s)]
*  And like, especially when you talk about those Dallas seems like, you know, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1330.64s)]
*  how do you see the West or whatever? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1333.2s)]
*  The number of times I would hear different staffs go like, well, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1334.96s)]
*  they've got Carlisle. So that's good for like another however, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1337.92s)]
*  like whatever you think their floor is, like move them up a couple of seeds. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1341.4s)]
*  Because that's how good. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1345.24s)]
*  It's like, wow, that's 10 wins. Cause they have Tom on. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1347.08s)]
*  I swear it, man. I just wish, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1350.24s)]
*  and I don't know if he's the guy to do it, even though have you ever met him? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1353.44s)]
*  Carlisle? Yeah. Cause he did some ESPN stuff for a split second. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1359.28s)]
*  He's interesting guy. Nice guy. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1363.0s)]
*  Yeah. We had him around, um, you know, when back in the Bristol days and like, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1365.48s)]
*  if he came in and you could make any kind of connection, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1370.08s)]
*  he would give you kind of this rise smile, like open up a little bit. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1372.32s)]
*  But if you didn't really have anything to offer, he, he wasn't like, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1375.76s)]
*  he wasn't a guy that was going to walk in and just be like, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1380.1599999999999s)]
*  what do you guys want to talk about? Like, let's go. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1382.24s)]
*  And these different guys have different personalities, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1384.0s)]
*  but that's the part of the game that I get frustrated with. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1386.56s)]
*  Cause I'd love to know like what Carlisle's talking about with his assistance. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1389.4399999999998s)]
*  Like, okay, this is, I mean, we can sit here and say, Hey, they wanted to attack this. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1393.0s)]
*  They wanted to try to get cat confused with whether or not he was going to come [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1396.28s)]
*  up or whether he was going to be in drop. And then if he's out, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1399.12s)]
*  that we're going to go with Brunson here. Um, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1401.56s)]
*  so there's some simple things that I think most of us that watch this game a [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1403.8799999999999s)]
*  lot can identify, but I would just love to know, like when he's done, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1406.56s)]
*  like this is what we would do. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  And these are the conversations that we would have. And these were the debates [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1411.56s)]
*  that we would have. And here's something we did that we knew didn't work. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1414.7199999999998s)]
*  And then here's how we corrected all of that stuff. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1417.4399999999998s)]
*  I feel like there's still a massive disconnect with this sport that we all love, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1419.8s)]
*  where I would like to understand that stuff at a greater level, finishing there. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1423.28s)]
*  Cause as an aside, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  how many years do you think you're going to reference the second round Celtics [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1429.2s)]
*  next thing? Cause this is, this one is going to haunt you. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1432.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, let's see what happens with Tatum. Cause it all leads to, you know, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1439.3600000000001s)]
*  um, it's a, it's definitely a top four. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1445.5200000000002s)]
*  The combo of those two games definitely top four were Celtics losses. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1449.0s)]
*  2010 is your worst finals experience, right? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1453.5200000000002s)]
*  Game seven. Yeah. That's, that's the worst. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1456.0800000000002s)]
*  I was, I was actually under the basket. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1460.04s)]
*  The Lakers were had for the second half watching Gasol just run a mock [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1463.0s)]
*  against a wiped out Rashid Wallace. That was the worst. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1468.1200000000001s)]
*  So you were some other bad ones watching the cells, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  not be able to get a rebound in person pretty close. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And Gasol, especially who they had kind of manhandled [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1476.96s)]
*  on no weight and then was, it was a little like them hard last night. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1481.96s)]
*  The, uh, the Carlisle thing. Remember that Dallas team he had [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1486.16s)]
*  when they had Luca and poor Zingas and it just didn't feel right. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1490.4s)]
*  And they had it for a couple of years and they even, they, they, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1495.76s)]
*  they had that Clippers series that they lost four three the year after the COVID, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1498.4s)]
*  but it was clear. It wasn't, it was like, has he lost the team? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1503.72s)]
*  I remember even talking to you in the pod about it. Like, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1507.04s)]
*  is Carlisle kind of run his course? Why can't he unlock this team? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1509.76s)]
*  And now you see the team that he has now. And it's just clear, like, this is, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1514.08s)]
*  this is just such a better, uh, type of team for him to have. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1518.3999999999999s)]
*  And maybe that maybe when you're coaching Luca and he has the ball all the time [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1522.12s)]
*  and you can't really have a lot of input in a Luke offense, right? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1526.52s)]
*  It kind of is what it is. It's like having an input in a James Harden offense. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1530.32s)]
*  At some point, somebody just hears the car keys. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1534.2399999999998s)]
*  They're just going to do what they want. Like how's Rick Carlisle really going to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1537.36s)]
*  help it? So it's interesting that not only does he, uh, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1540.04s)]
*  he pulls that hard halibut trade off and then the Siakam piece, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1543.92s)]
*  which I think we were all like, okay, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1549.44s)]
*  they didn't really give up that much. You got to do it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  But turns out to be this incredibly impactful trade and they really didn't give [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1556.8s)]
*  up that much. And they gave up, what'd they give up? They gave up, uh, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1561.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1566.16s)]
*  I had it on my notes here somewhere, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1568.64s)]
*  but it was like just a couple of meaningless firsts and a couple of contracts. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1569.96s)]
*  And that gets their 2026 unprotected. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1573.76s)]
*  Is it because he wasn't, uh, I remember when the trade happened, uh, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1577.0800000000002s)]
*  there was something that I wasn't good on where it was like, all right, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1581.8000000000002s)]
*  so Siakam, like this is actually kind of like a Nick's conversation. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1586.0800000000002s)]
*  Cause this time of year, or even after the transactional stuff, it's like, okay, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1588.92s)]
*  but does this good mean you're a champion? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1591.88s)]
*  Look at Y [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  Super fonts. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1619.5800000000002s)]
*  It's not nothing. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1620.36s)]
*  Right, and it was the Bruce Brown deal [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1621.9599999999998s)]
*  because remember he had the contract. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1623.3999999999999s)]
*  Which again, that contract was so funny [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1626.24s)]
*  because he ended up making all of that money [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1628.28s)]
*  on all this stuff. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1629.9199999999998s)]
*  So it was the Jacoby Walter pick [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1630.76s)]
*  and then it's a 26 first. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1632.9199999999998s)]
*  So you're thinking, okay, fine, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1634.6799999999998s)]
*  the players don't mean anything [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1636.8799999999999s)]
*  and you structured the Brown contract [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1638.6799999999998s)]
*  this way in the first place. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1640.24s)]
*  But you also now have to pay Siakam. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1642.4399999999998s)]
*  And it's like, ooh. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1645.08s)]
*  I didn't know if he was gonna stay there. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1646.36s)]
*  And then look, if they keep him fine, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1649.4799999999998s)]
*  but if you're doing this and he's an expiring, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1653.04s)]
*  what are you doing? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1655.8s)]
*  Then as soon as I had said it, somebody texted me, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1656.62s)]
*  it was like, he's doing an extension. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1658.04s)]
*  It's already understood. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1659.52s)]
*  It's done. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1661.0s)]
*  The part that I would criticize myself on [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1662.06s)]
*  with the Siakam thing. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1664.7199999999998s)]
*  I love their self-evaluation. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1666.12s)]
*  This is why you're one of the best. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1667.76s)]
*  Well, because I've seen him have playoff moments [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1669.76s)]
*  where I'm like, where is he? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1673.7199999999998s)]
*  And then I think he becomes a little predictable at times [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  and then I felt like all of that was reinforced [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1678.8000000000002s)]
*  where he was relying on game one. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1680.88s)]
*  And then from that point on, the guy was a stud. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1682.0s)]
*  So I give it to him. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1683.9s)]
*  And I think I've even said at times, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1685.6000000000001s)]
*  like debating like a couple of years, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1688.64s)]
*  you're like, man, am I gonna vote this guy third team [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1690.44s)]
*  all NBA and looking at it? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1692.44s)]
*  And it's like, I probably don't give him enough credit [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1693.8400000000001s)]
*  for the stability level that he is at, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1697.0400000000002s)]
*  knowing he's never gonna flirt with some of these other guys [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1700.6000000000001s)]
*  that the guys were paying all this attention to. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1703.0600000000002s)]
*  Anyway, the other part of the criticism was just that, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1704.48s)]
*  well, all right, Siakam's pretty good. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1707.72s)]
*  But then they were like, hey, we're the Pacers. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1709.32s)]
*  Like who's demanding to be traded here? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1711.4s)]
*  Who are we saving our cap space for? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1713.84s)]
*  So now we're playing Siakam 37 minutes a night [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1715.92s)]
*  where the guy who's had a track record, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  who's done some things in the playoffs, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1721.08s)]
*  despite this weird stretch where he didn't seem like [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1722.4s)]
*  he could hit a three in the playoffs [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1724.2s)]
*  for like a bunch of years in a row. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1725.32s)]
*  That's the part of against him. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1727.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think the part that we all need to do [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1728.88s)]
*  a better job with is like, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1730.6000000000001s)]
*  you're assuming a lot that you're supposed to wait around [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1733.3600000000001s)]
*  for the better option than Siakam. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1736.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1739.48s)]
*  I think it was a red flag that Toronto was trying to, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1741.0s)]
*  didn't wanna keep him, I think was the red flag. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1743.7s)]
*  But the thing I remember us talking about when it happened [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1746.32s)]
*  was we do these Ringer 100 lists [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1749.32s)]
*  when you actually list all the players. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1753.44s)]
*  And it's like, he's always, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1755.24s)]
*  well, he's always in the 35 to 50 range, right? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1757.52s)]
*  He always plays 35 to 37 minutes a game. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1760.52s)]
*  He's been in big spots. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1764.54s)]
*  Like in the 2019 Raptors, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1765.74s)]
*  it's 37 minutes a game on a team that won the title, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1768.42s)]
*  19 and seven. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1770.86s)]
*  He's been a second team OMBA and a third team OMBA. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1772.1399999999999s)]
*  Last two years in the playoffs for the Pacers, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1774.98s)]
*  he was 21 and seven. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1776.86s)]
*  And I think it was really smart. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1780.6599999999999s)]
*  The question I had, and you really felt it, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1782.18s)]
*  cause they started out 10 and 15, Rossello. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1783.94s)]
*  And it was like, is this guy the right fit for them? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1787.58s)]
*  Because Haliburton wants to play fast [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  and it doesn't seem like Siakam always wants to play fast. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1792.66s)]
*  And it seemed to me, especially when Haliburton [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1795.94s)]
*  wasn't playing well the first two months, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1798.26s)]
*  it always seemed a little push and pull [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1800.8200000000002s)]
*  with the pace with them. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1802.18s)]
*  And I think what's been great about Siakam [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1803.72s)]
*  is he's now like supercharged himself. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1805.78s)]
*  The pace he plays with now, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1809.8600000000001s)]
*  I've never seen him play like that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1811.2s)]
*  I think that was one of the reasons he was so special [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1813.24s)]
*  in this conference finals was he was, you know, flying. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1815.26s)]
*  It really did look like mid 2000s Sean Marion. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1820.42s)]
*  That was what it reminded me of, like some of the stuff. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1823.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think he's a little bit [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1825.3s)]
*  of a better offensive player, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1826.3s)]
*  but I thought he was that impactful offensively. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1828.14s)]
*  And his ability to guard, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1830.3s)]
*  basically every player on the Knicks, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1832.02s)]
*  you know, you don't ideally want him on Brunson, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1834.9s)]
*  but if he got on a switch with him, he could handle him. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1836.94s)]
*  But he could also guard towns. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1839.62s)]
*  He could guard bridges or in an OB. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1841.34s)]
*  Like pick a neck, he could guard him. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1843.3s)]
*  So I thought, I don't know, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1844.84s)]
*  I wasn't like upset that he won, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1847.54s)]
*  but I just think in general, I don't love those things. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1850.5s)]
*  So most unconventional finals teams we've ever had, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1852.98s)]
*  and I would define unconventional as [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1857.7s)]
*  your season wasn't very good, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1859.5s)]
*  or you don't have like a clear top 10, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1862.54s)]
*  top 12 guy in the league. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1865.14s)]
*  So we just go back 25 years. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1867.22s)]
*  The 23 Heat team that beat the Celts in seven [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1870.18s)]
*  was 44 and 38. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1875.0600000000002s)]
*  But they had Butler just for whatever reason [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1877.98s)]
*  in that Buck series and for a little stretch there, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1882.14s)]
*  it just seemed like he was one of the best six guys [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1884.78s)]
*  in the world. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1886.6200000000001s)]
*  So it made sense, but when you look back, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1887.46s)]
*  maybe not as much. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1888.5800000000002s)]
*  2020 Heat, bubble year, 44 and 29. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1890.1000000000001s)]
*  I just think all bets are off in the bubble. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1895.0600000000002s)]
*  I thought of the 14 Spurs, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1897.94s)]
*  cause they didn't, they had like Duncan at the tail end, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1901.02s)]
*  Kawhi wasn't Kawhi yet, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1904.5800000000002s)]
*  Parker at the tail end of his prime. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1906.02s)]
*  They went 62 and 20 that year. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1908.54s)]
*  They made the finals the year before. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1910.62s)]
*  Parker was second team all in BA, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1912.66s)]
*  then he played 29 minutes a game. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1914.5s)]
*  It was a little unconventional, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1917.46s)]
*  but I can't really give it to him. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1918.66s)]
*  07 Cavs, 50 and 32. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1920.98s)]
*  But they had young LeBron who, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1925.34s)]
*  that fit the prototype of like, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1927.7s)]
*  you can make the finals with an awesome guy. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1929.22s)]
*  04 Pistons, they were 54 and 28, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1932.06s)]
*  but that was probably the best defensive team [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1936.6999999999998s)]
*  of the century. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1938.1s)]
*  I don't know how unconventional that was. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1938.9399999999998s)]
*  And then the 99 Knicks is the only other ones. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1940.3799999999999s)]
*  Lockout season, they went 27 and 23. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1943.1799999999998s)]
*  Ewing gets hurt, they're the eight seed, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1946.1399999999999s)]
*  and they somehow get to the finals anyway. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1949.26s)]
*  I would put the 25 Pacers up against almost anybody, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1952.3s)]
*  especially the odds would reflect it. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1956.1399999999999s)]
*  They were 28 to one to win the conference [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1957.9799999999998s)]
*  and you win the conference. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1959.6599999999999s)]
*  Even when we would talk about it on this pod, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1961.1799999999998s)]
*  I think I was higher than them, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1963.3799999999999s)]
*  and then the Mew, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1964.98s)]
*  but I also wouldn't have said, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1966.06s)]
*  this is the team that's gonna make it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1968.6599999999999s)]
*  I thought they were slippery, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1970.7s)]
*  but I thought the Quippers were slippery too, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1972.02s)]
*  and they got bounced around one. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1973.74s)]
*  I think this is about as weird as it gets, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1977.98s)]
*  Rosillo, for the finals. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1979.62s)]
*  This is as wildcardy as we've gotten in either conference. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1981.1799999999998s)]
*  Do you know the last time there was a 1-4 matchup [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1986.98s)]
*  in the finals? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1988.78s)]
*  When? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1993.74s)]
*  Your least favorite finals of all time. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1995.22s)]
*  Which one? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=1999.86s)]
*  I have a lot of least favorite finals. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2000.86s)]
*  We just talked about it, 2010, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2003.3s)]
*  Lakers-Selflick's seven games. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2005.26s)]
*  Do you know how many times the fourth seed has won? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2008.1399999999999s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2013.34s)]
*  One time. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2015.4199999999998s)]
*  You know how many times a team that was plus 200 or more [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2017.26s)]
*  in the odds heading into the finals has won? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2021.1399999999999s)]
*  I think it's twice. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2023.4199999999998s)]
*  I think it was the 95 Rockets [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2025.74s)]
*  and the 04 Pistons were the two. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2029.62s)]
*  Do you remember the fourth seed, the beta one seed? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2033.62s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2042.06s)]
*  Your Celtics in 69. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2043.02s)]
*  Oh, 69, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2045.62s)]
*  Which is one of the weirder finals, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2047.3799999999999s)]
*  but there's some similarity. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2049.7s)]
*  Well, there's actually no similarities [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2051.7s)]
*  because that's the Boston team that has this legendary run [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2052.98s)]
*  and it's like, okay, they're done. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2055.58s)]
*  But yeah, I think there's still a lot of meat on the bone [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2058.58s)]
*  of who the Pacers are [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2061.7799999999997s)]
*  because as we sit here all impressed with them, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2064.46s)]
*  I am undaunted in that. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2067.1s)]
*  This is normally not how it goes. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2071.14s)]
*  Let's take a break. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2073.98s)]
*  We're gonna bring in Van Lathen, talk about the Knicks. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2074.8199999999997s)]

*  I'm the same man who once wore the same T-shirt [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2082.94s)]
*  every single day during the 2003 baseball playoffs. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2086.06s)]
*  I am the same person who will tell my wife [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2090.1s)]
*  to come into the room when I need a team to win [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2092.02s)]
*  because she's good luck during the NBA playoffs. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2094.42s)]
*  These are things that happen. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2096.54s)]
*  Well, Mikolob Ultra, a great addition [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2097.94s)]
*  to any game time routine, it is a superior light beer. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2099.8599999999997s)]
*  It's really great. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2103.7s)]
*  And they're getting fans closer to the game [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2104.54s)]
*  and they're getting fans closer to the game. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2107.2599999999998s)]
*  So, we're gonna bring in Van Lathen, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2109.2999999999997s)]

*  being in the NBA finals? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2134.2799999999997s)]
*  We just talked about this for 35 minutes. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2135.3399999999997s)]
*  We know they are higher than anything else. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2137.66s)]
*  Let's get rid of the Pacers, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2141.2999999999997s)]
*  let's get rid of the Pacers, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2143.8999999999996s)]

*  The players never win. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2151.7s)]
*  Let's get rid of the Pacers' players [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2152.66s)]
*  when they're going through GRÜNEN. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2153.9799999999996s)]
*  They're all about the Pacers immediately. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2155.22s)]
*  for 35 minutes. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2156.56s)]
*  I think it's good. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2160.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2162.4s)]
*  Wow. Great start. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2163.64s)]
*  I mean, look, what you guys want me to say, I think they're a fun [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2165.92s)]
*  team. This guy. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2168.84s)]
*  There you go. I mean, I mean, I don't I'm really kind of [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2170.48s)]
*  I think it's a much better story if the Knicks are in the finals. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2174.52s)]
*  OK, make the case. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2178.52s)]
*  The Knicks just bring a lot with them to the finals. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2180.92s)]
*  They bring a lot of different storylines, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2184.44s)]
*  a team that has an incredible [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2187.96s)]
*  cultural identity in the NBA. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2190.96s)]
*  But when you look back in their history, just not a ton of winning. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2194.44s)]
*  So that means you have something that you normally don't get, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2199.44s)]
*  which is a gigantic market with a storied franchise, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2203.0s)]
*  but also a starving fan base and [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2207.0s)]
*  probably the most fun fan base in the entire country. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2210.4s)]
*  In terms of their ability to be [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2214.44s)]
*  both funny, violent, ridiculous. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2217.4s)]
*  You know, if you saw a Knicks fan with [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2221.08s)]
*  their dog died like blue and orange [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2225.2000000000003s)]
*  or if you saw somebody walking down the street [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2228.84s)]
*  and they had an Anaconda or like a python [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2232.52s)]
*  on their shoulders and it had like a Knicks cap on it, you'd be like, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2236.12s)]
*  that's a Knicks fan. And they're a fun fan base. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2239.76s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're right. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2243.6s)]
*  For that reason and kind of a scrappy, interesting team. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2244.7599999999998s)]
*  I like the Pacers. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2248.36s)]
*  I'm a Tyrese Halliburton fan. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2250.2s)]
*  They have an amazing fan base. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2253.08s)]
*  They haven't been there a while in a while. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2254.64s)]
*  But they're more of a fun basketball team. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2257.0s)]
*  The Knicks were more of a fun cultural team to me. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2259.4s)]
*  And culture always beats basketball when you're talking about [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2262.04s)]
*  who you want to see compete. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2265.08s)]
*  So Vance is star fuckers, what he's telling us. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2266.36s)]
*  So I'm telling you is that it would have been fun to have the Knicks in it. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2268.48s)]
*  He was like, oh, that's Chalamet. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2271.56s)]
*  I've seen some of his movies. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2272.96s)]
*  Can I have the can you just Iso for me here for like a minute on this? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2275.68s)]
*  Yeah, you want to go Brunson style? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2280.64s)]
*  No, no, no. Well, yeah, yeah, it might be hard. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2282.32s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to take my time. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2285.4s)]
*  Harden it. OK, we'll go stand in the corners. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2286.92s)]
*  Get out of my way, Daniel House. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2289.28s)]
*  So the celebrity shots, I'll admit, like I'm watching a regular season [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2292.04s)]
*  Knicks game and they do celebrity row. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2298.32s)]
*  And you're like, OK. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2301.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, wow. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2303.96s)]
*  Hey, Bernard King's there again. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2305.48s)]
*  And then we finished with Spike Lee, who a lot of us are kind of like [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2308.0s)]
*  when he started trying to glom onto the St. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2311.36s)]
*  John's thing like, dude, are you serious? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2313.56s)]
*  Like, come on, what are you doing? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2316.68s)]
*  But then when the next thing you notice, it's like. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2319.56s)]
*  Hey, it's that guy again. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2322.6s)]
*  And for whatever reason, like our guy, Miles Teller, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2325.04s)]
*  he's right next to Chalamet, and they don't even give him a graphic, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2327.8s)]
*  which I imagine when you're at a certain level is like a pretty major actor [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2331.44s)]
*  in Hollywood when they give the graphic to the person like Chalamet, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2335.2400000000002s)]
*  who I understand what level he's at, but you don't even get a graphic. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2338.5200000000004s)]
*  Like, that's the kind of thing where you're talking to your PR people. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2341.5600000000004s)]
*  And I like firing them. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2344.76s)]
*  I would say I was next to Chalamet after a Lakers game once. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2346.28s)]
*  And I almost I was so close to just saying, hey, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2350.0400000000004s)]
*  just so you know, your PR people keep turning down Bill Simmons. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2353.1200000000003s)]
*  And we know it's not getting to you. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2356.24s)]
*  Here's Bill's number. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2358.0s)]
*  Just go on the pod and talk some hoops. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2359.3199999999997s)]
*  But I was like, I'm not going to do that because security might come running over. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2361.64s)]
*  I'll do that. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2365.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't I don't care. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2367.2s)]
*  I don't I don't need it. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2368.9199999999996s)]
*  These celebrities that have to stand up fucking courtside, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2370.56s)]
*  like you don't have to stand up. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2373.72s)]
*  There's nobody in front of you. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2375.04s)]
*  It's like having a beach house and complaining about an obstructed view. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2376.16s)]
*  Fair, fair point. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2378.9199999999996s)]
*  There's this massive sideline courtside [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2380.04s)]
*  bullshit that goes along with this. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2383.64s)]
*  Like I felt bad for the like Mike Epps was like, I'm around [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2385.96s)]
*  because the Pacers just didn't have any balance when they were going [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2389.68s)]
*  with Celebrity Row on some of these broadcasts. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2392.48s)]
*  So, yes, I am guilty of wondering at times during a regular season broadcast, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2394.0s)]
*  but knowing that the finals was going to be just like we were going to see a lot of it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2398.96s)]
*  And I don't know what Oklahoma City was going to do [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2402.92s)]
*  because you just can't hang with still in this line. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2405.2s)]
*  So you got to bring in hater. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2407.16s)]
*  Haters like the only one they have. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2408.84s)]
*  My other thing with is, yeah, we get Chenoweth out there. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2410.76s)]
*  I make that happen. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2414.12s)]
*  Um, Eric Chenoweth, but [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2415.56s)]
*  the next the MSG crowd whenever they would do Celebrity Row, very anti jam bands. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2420.84s)]
*  Trey was always right there on the baseline. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2425.8s)]
*  Trey from Fish, you can't fucking give him a graphic. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2429.6s)]
*  Derek Trucks is over there. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2433.12s)]
*  So I noticed a lot of anti jam band stuff. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2434.92s)]
*  I noticed the same five or six people over and over again. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2437.64s)]
*  And if it had been Nick's OKC, it was going to be really one sided [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2440.56s)]
*  and kind of annoying. And it's like we got it. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2443.88s)]
*  The lady from Law and Order is there again. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2446.08s)]
*  What you got to know is something. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2449.76s)]
*  When I talked about the mix and their fan base, I talked about the people. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2451.96s)]
*  I talked about the people with dogs and outside fighting. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2457.6s)]
*  You're a man of the people. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2461.96s)]
*  Arrassing ESPN people. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2463.04s)]
*  I talked about those people. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2464.88s)]
*  Those are the people that I talked about. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2466.6s)]
*  I couldn't care less about the the the Celebrity Row type of stuff. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2467.96s)]
*  I don't like it. It's not my type of deal. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2472.8s)]
*  But I think the Knicks fans are a cool fan base up or down. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2475.28s)]
*  And I just wanted to see them in the finals. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2479.7599999999998s)]
*  But I like the Pacers like the Pacers are a fun basketball team. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2481.96s)]
*  Run up and down the court, you know, three and a half seconds or less. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2485.72s)]
*  It's fun. It's fun. I'm here for it. I'm ready for it. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2488.88s)]
*  But I thought I really wanted to see the Knicks pull it off. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2491.2s)]
*  I have no idea why I was rooting for the Knicks, but I was. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2493.24s)]
*  I am pro Pacers fan base, and they've also [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2495.68s)]
*  so they won three ABA titles in 70 and 72 and 73. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2499.12s)]
*  Nothing since half century drought for them. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2503.8s)]
*  And then OKC is never one. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2508.28s)]
*  And if you give them [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2510.6s)]
*  if you give them the Sonics title and say that was their last title, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2512.8s)]
*  I have two middle fingers for you because that wasn't their title. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2516.12s)]
*  Just like the foot, just like the five Minneapolis titles [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2519.8s)]
*  do not belong to the Los Angeles Lakers. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2522.64s)]
*  That's fucking bullshit, too. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2524.48s)]
*  The Sonics existed. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  They won the title and it does not belong to OKC. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2528.2s)]
*  Anyway, the Knicks. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2531.3199999999997s)]
*  So the underreaction would be. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2534.3599999999997s)]
*  We made the final four. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2538.6s)]
*  We beat Boston. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2540.04s)]
*  We had a really good season. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2541.56s)]
*  We have really good players on good contracts. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2543.12s)]
*  Why wouldn't we run this back? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2546.64s)]
*  The East is going to be worse. Tatum's out for the year. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2547.8799999999997s)]
*  Cleveland, God only knows what's going to happen with them. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2550.16s)]
*  Indiana might be having this miracle run like we're really talented. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2552.8799999999997s)]
*  We can fix this. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2557.0s)]
*  The overreaction would be we've got to make trades. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2558.36s)]
*  We've got to fire our coach. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2560.52s)]
*  Then would you underreact or overreact? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2563.32s)]
*  I would underreact, but they're going to overreact. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2565.96s)]
*  It is just too much for everything that they were able to accomplish. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2570.2s)]
*  And they had by any metric, a really successful season. Right. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2574.4s)]
*  There's too much uncertainty for them. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2578.56s)]
*  When you talk to people that are close to the Knicks [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2581.4s)]
*  or like in and around the franchise, like he's like having Shams here now. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2584.84s)]
*  Jesus. Well, hey, if you're connected to Tommy Alters. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2589.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2593.48s)]
*  When you're connected to Tommy Alters, you're one step from almost every player [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2594.48s)]
*  in the NBA and probably the high school players as well. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2597.84s)]
*  He knows them all. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2600.52s)]
*  I think he's coming through L.A. with Kevin Herter. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2601.7200000000003s)]
*  Man, are you in on that lunch? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2604.84s)]
*  I probably will be. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2606.6400000000003s)]
*  Kevin Herter and then Sam and Sean. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2607.76s)]
*  It'll be Herter. It'll be Herter, Tommy. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2610.04s)]
*  And then name. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2613.48s)]
*  Undescript white star. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2617.52s)]
*  Caitlin Clark's nephew. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2619.96s)]
*  You don't know who that other person is going to be, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2622.6s)]
*  but they're going to be somebody, you know, it might be Bill Hader. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2625.24s)]
*  It could be John Krasinski is going to be a hey, you know, Krasinski is coming. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2629.72s)]
*  He's meeting us at Babel. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2634.16s)]
*  Hater's coming. Don't talk about Barry with them. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2635.3599999999997s)]
*  He doesn't want to talk about it. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2637.64s)]
*  Don't bury it. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2639.24s)]
*  I want to talk about David Lee Roth with him. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2640.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, wow. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2644.7200000000003s)]
*  So, yeah, so you got school tomorrow. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2646.48s)]
*  But it seems like the people inside and close to them, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2651.48s)]
*  they're unhappy with the brand of basketball that's being played [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2654.32s)]
*  or cat's ability to defend and to stay and drop during this whole time. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2658.32s)]
*  They want something different. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2662.88s)]
*  Like, well, did you did you see the now they tell a story in the athletic [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2664.52s)]
*  that seemed to be in the athletic engine for four days [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2668.56s)]
*  in case they lost game five? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2672.0s)]
*  It was up. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2673.84s)]
*  I think that was the fastest I've ever seen a piece like that up. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2675.28s)]
*  I don't think the game would have been over for 20 minutes. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2678.44s)]
*  And there was a 4000 word athletic story with all the issues the team had [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2681.36s)]
*  and then crammed into a couple of paragraphs for like two sentences was [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2685.56s)]
*  after they lost to the Nick, to the Pacers last night. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2689.44s)]
*  And it was clearly all written and right towns and Tibbido were the two. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2692.48s)]
*  Kind of stars of the piece in not a good way, then. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2698.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would underreact. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2701.48s)]
*  I think they have a great core. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2703.3199999999997s)]
*  I think they got a little injured towards the end of the year. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2705.6s)]
*  Obviously, nobody's hurt. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2707.8799999999997s)]
*  But I think you had cat with the knee. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  You had Mitchell Robinson also dealing with some things. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2712.52s)]
*  I don't know how much you can get out of this team. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2715.64s)]
*  I mean, obviously, they need to add, you know, depth, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2717.7599999999998s)]
*  but I don't know how much you can get out of this team. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2720.48s)]
*  You can't have depth and also pay two hundred and ten million dollars for seven. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2722.3999999999996s)]
*  I guess it's the problem about the problems that they have. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2726.12s)]
*  Just about the problems that they have. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2728.0s)]
*  So I'm saying to me, because they are where they are, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2729.4s)]
*  I, you know, see if they can run it back and get another magical run [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2733.0s)]
*  and get over the top this time. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2735.88s)]
*  Rossello under or over. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2737.36s)]
*  I feel like I added some tension here with Van. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2740.08s)]
*  I think he's he's. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2742.48s)]
*  Now, you can't. Van loves it. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2744.52s)]
*  The more tension, the better for Van. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2746.6s)]
*  This is where he thrives. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2748.28s)]
*  You should have saw what I brought up Chewbacca during the Star Wars pod. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2749.4s)]
*  How he that was when the pod really took off. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2752.36s)]
*  You better watch out. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2755.1600000000003s)]
*  There's a whole Chewbacca does have an asshole. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2757.72s)]
*  You I'm sure he of course he does. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2760.8799999999997s)]
*  He has to take a shit. You have you better watch out. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2763.0s)]
*  There are a lot of people out here in the Star Wars celebration streets [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2764.9199999999996s)]
*  that are waiting to see you on one of these walks randomly in L.A. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2769.12s)]
*  to tell you what you're back off. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2773.04s)]
*  OK, yeah, I'll keep it. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2774.7999999999997s)]
*  I am. Yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2776.48s)]
*  If I see a big furry person walking forward to me, I'll just start running. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2777.64s)]
*  We still have under reactor over react. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2780.48s)]
*  Under reacts. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2783.64s)]
*  Most wins since 2013, first Eastern Conference final since 2000, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2785.4s)]
*  they were 0 and 10 against Cleveland, Boston and OKC. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2789.28s)]
*  It felt like it was pretty clear that they were a step [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2791.92s)]
*  below all of those teams and they end up being really competitive with the Pacers. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2795.6s)]
*  I know that there's a bit of an assumption today, too. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2799.8s)]
*  It's like, hey, if they hold on to game one, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2801.96s)]
*  then maybe it goes back to New York for game seven. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2804.04s)]
*  I think that's I don't like to just take a win away from a team [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2805.96s)]
*  and then give it to the other one and then say the next five would go [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  the exact same way, because as I like to say, is all the outcome. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2811.6800000000003s)]
*  They're connected. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2815.36s)]
*  The reason OKC lays a massive egg in Minnesota in game three [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2816.2400000000002s)]
*  is because they figured out those two, three quarters in games one and two. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2820.0s)]
*  They're like, we're just going to be better than these guys. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2823.28s)]
*  And it's going to be fine. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2824.96s)]
*  The same reason why the Pacers up three one lose game five and see outcomes like, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2825.96s)]
*  hey, they played harder than us. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2829.88s)]
*  Yeah, they were facing elimination. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2830.84s)]
*  They were home. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2832.32s)]
*  You knew you had one at home in your back pocket. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2833.08s)]
*  And then you probably had another chance, you know, if it were going to go to game seven. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2835.52s)]
*  So there is definitely a way you could talk yourself into the Knicks, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2838.6400000000003s)]
*  maybe being ready for a game seven. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2842.1600000000003s)]
*  If that shot from Halliburton doesn't go down and send it to overtime. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2843.8s)]
*  But this was a boring team that got a lot of coverage for a long time. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2847.6400000000003s)]
*  They pieced it together in a really calculated way. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2853.88s)]
*  They were smarter than everybody on Brunson. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2857.76s)]
*  You know, he's a nice player. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2859.76s)]
*  Nobody thought he was going to be. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2861.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not even sure they thought he was going to be this. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2862.04s)]
*  The O.G. nobody thought anyone who says they thought that is insane. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2864.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, nobody in a million years thought he was going to be a guy [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2869.1600000000003s)]
*  who averaged 30 points a game in the NBA. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2871.8s)]
*  Rick Rick, his dad is like, shit, I don't know. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2874.44s)]
*  He was this nice. You know, I remember we did a pod segment that summer where we [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2876.6800000000003s)]
*  because remember they were talking about whether they overpaid or not. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2880.92s)]
*  And it wasn't even the max. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2883.1600000000003s)]
*  It was a hundred million, wasn't it? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2885.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, we were like, we kind of liked it, but it was like, who knows? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2887.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean, you also had like that bad playoff series at the mass. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2892.8s)]
*  But I don't really hold that against this is something that Bill, you've taught me, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2896.36s)]
*  especially with some of these younger guys that have these really big profiles [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2900.28s)]
*  and a nice regular season and all the counting stuff that we all love. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2904.0400000000004s)]
*  And it's like your first taste of it out there, even if it's not a conference finals. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2907.36s)]
*  You see guys that just aren't super comfortable. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2910.2000000000003s)]
*  They have to you have to go through that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2911.92s)]
*  I think Brunson even had a little of that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2913.84s)]
*  And now he's like one of the most comfortable dudes ever in these huge moments. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2915.36s)]
*  The cat thing is a risk. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2919.1200000000003s)]
*  But, you know, it's funny because every bad Randall game and every good cat game, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2920.6400000000003s)]
*  you're like, how could Minnesota give up this guy? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2925.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you see the cat struggles at times. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2927.48s)]
*  You're like, this is why Minnesota was like, we're good to move on from this. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2930.44s)]
*  And the fact that he's going to be 60 million in the last year of this deal, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2933.2000000000003s)]
*  it still goes a bunch of years. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2936.7200000000003s)]
*  The bridges. Can I give you the money quickly? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2937.96s)]
*  It's massive. 49, 49 next year. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2940.92s)]
*  Fifty three, 57, 61, 61. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2945.16s)]
*  And unless they unless the league officially legalizes him being able to drive [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2950.48s)]
*  to the basket and kneeing guys in the balls as hard as he can, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2954.88s)]
*  which I think they made a lot of progress with yesterday because it happened twice. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2958.04s)]
*  If they legalize that, I think he'll be unstoppable. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2962.6s)]
*  But I'm pretty sure that's not a legal play, man. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2965.76s)]
*  It's just impossible to have a guy making that much money [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2968.1600000000003s)]
*  unless that guy is going to anchor your franchise and then like, wait, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2970.7200000000003s)]
*  like paying that much. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2976.12s)]
*  He's become a complimentary player, a very important complimentary player there. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2978.6800000000003s)]
*  But he's a complimentary player. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2982.2000000000003s)]
*  And you just know you're not going to be able to win [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2983.84s)]
*  paying a complimentary player that much money, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2985.4s)]
*  if especially if your ace is not one of the top five guys in the entire league. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2987.4s)]
*  And Rossella was about to mention the Bridges contract, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2992.76s)]
*  which is the other looming piece of this 24.9 next year. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2995.28s)]
*  Then he's a free agent, but they can take care of him this summer, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=2999.2400000000002s)]
*  blow out the deal, make it longer, bigger. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3002.88s)]
*  But now you're really locked into the team. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3005.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3007.32s)]
*  But you're probably sitting there going when Brunson also took [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3008.48s)]
*  what seemed unfathomable at the time, a four year deal for 156 [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3011.0s)]
*  instead of the five year 270 deal, which is like peak Brady going, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3015.0s)]
*  yeah, that's fine. I'll take way less than everybody else. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3019.52s)]
*  Oh, we didn't bring in any receivers again. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3021.84s)]
*  Why did I take a pay cut? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3023.92s)]
*  They did that to him for like five straight years. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3026.08s)]
*  Look, when this when this team got rolling and you saw the pick and pop [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3028.84s)]
*  pick and stuff, like all of the different combos of Brunson and Kat, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3033.04s)]
*  where you've got these two great shooters, Kat for big is is fine. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3037.2400000000002s)]
*  Like even when it's ugly, it still works way more than I ever want to think [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3040.68s)]
*  that it's going to work when it starts. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3044.08s)]
*  You're like, this is going to work. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3045.68s)]
*  You're like, it kind of worked again. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3046.8799999999997s)]
*  Their offense by month. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3048.92s)]
*  Let's go over it right now. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3051.04s)]
*  October 3rd, best in the NBA. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3052.2s)]
*  November, the best offense in the NBA. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3054.12s)]
*  December of third best offense in the NBA. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3055.8799999999997s)]
*  January, the sixth best offense. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3058.92s)]
*  February 13th, best offense. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3061.2s)]
*  March, the 21st best offense. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3063.3199999999997s)]
*  April 18th, I think was only like eight games. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  Pre All-Star, the second best offense in the NBA. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3068.0s)]
*  After the All-Star break, the 11th best offense. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3070.44s)]
*  So really this becomes a conversation of like, what's going on here with this group? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3073.36s)]
*  How much flexibility do they have? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3076.96s)]
*  The other problem is if you look at their starting five from January 1st [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3078.36s)]
*  until last night, that's a negative group, negative one point, four [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3081.7200000000003s)]
*  points per one hundred possessions. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3086.36s)]
*  OK, in the playoffs, their starters out of the 16 playoff teams, they were ninth [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3087.84s)]
*  in net rating, I shouldn't say plus minus in net rating here of all starting groups. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3093.48s)]
*  You know, number one is OKC. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3098.64s)]
*  You see the Shamett thing, by the way, the Shamett and who's the other guy [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3100.2s)]
*  who had the best net rate? Right. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3104.72s)]
*  Yeah, right. They had the best plus minus on the team in the last round. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3106.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Reggie Miller had a few last night. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3110.56s)]
*  He even wondered out loud on the broadcast. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3112.3199999999997s)]
*  He's like, well, Shamett take Bridges minutes. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3114.2799999999997s)]
*  You're like, no. And by the way, Tibbs, when he tried to figure this out, get back in. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3116.16s)]
*  He closed with the five guys again. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3119.68s)]
*  All right. So number one and number two and plus in net rating again. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3121.3199999999997s)]
*  For starters, OKC is plus eight. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3125.56s)]
*  The Pacers are plus five and a half. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3127.88s)]
*  And the Knicks were on the negative side of things with that starting group. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3129.48s)]
*  So I think this is a huge win. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3132.6800000000003s)]
*  Celebrated Knicks fans who you've been, what they've done building towards [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3135.6s)]
*  this all the transactions. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3139.96s)]
*  But there is a hard conversation about who they are and what Kat is or isn't. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3142.04s)]
*  And that's the whole reason why a really front, a really smart front office [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3148.48s)]
*  in Minnesota. And I know some people argue it's more about the contract, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3153.44s)]
*  but a really smart front office is fine moving him for Randall and DeVincenzo. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3157.04s)]
*  Can I give you one other thing, Ben? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3161.4s)]
*  Sure. Because I agreed with everything Rossello just said. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3163.6s)]
*  And if you were evaluating this next team and you do glass half full [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3167.2799999999997s)]
*  and it's like, that was an awesome season. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3171.04s)]
*  We were one of the four teams left in the playoffs. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3172.6s)]
*  There's some we got Mitchell Robinson back with 17 games left. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3174.68s)]
*  And by the time we got to the third round, it was huge for us. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3178.04s)]
*  Let's run this back and see what we have. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3180.44s)]
*  On top of everything, Rossello just said. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3183.72s)]
*  So the Detroit series, they're down eight in the fourth quarter of game one, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3186.04s)]
*  down 11 with six minutes left in game two, down 10 with nine minutes left [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3190.16s)]
*  in game five and down 10 in the third quarter of game six. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3194.48s)]
*  In the Celtic series, they trailed by 15 plus in the first five games. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3198.88s)]
*  In this Pacers series, they were down double figures in four of the six games. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3203.6s)]
*  This is a team that routinely was behind trying to claw itself back [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3208.92s)]
*  with weird lineups and whatever. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3212.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think at some point you are who you are with that stuff. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3215.04s)]
*  If you're like, look at OKC, OKC, who's fucking awesome and is putting together [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3218.36s)]
*  one of the great seasons in the history of the league. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3223.44s)]
*  Like they killed teams at home. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3225.4s)]
*  They every time they played at home, basically, except for that first Denver game, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3228.8s)]
*  they were destroying the other team. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3233.56s)]
*  Right. And at some point, that's kind of our you are who you are. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3235.52s)]
*  And I think the reverse with the Knicks is like, if you're five guys together, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3238.44s)]
*  as good as they are on paper, don't play that well together. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3242.7999999999997s)]
*  And then we get to the playoffs and you're always falling behind. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3245.8799999999997s)]
*  At some point, that has to mean something. Right. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3248.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, yeah. But, you know, there is a certain point [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3252.04s)]
*  where anomaly becomes consistency. Right. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3253.9599999999996s)]
*  It becomes part of your DNA and part of who you are. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3256.52s)]
*  Maybe they get comfortable when they're down a little bit. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3260.9599999999996s)]
*  Maybe it's a part of of who they are in the makeup of their team. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3263.64s)]
*  I will say this, though. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3268.9599999999996s)]
*  It was easy for them to come back against the Celtics. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3270.88s)]
*  The Celtics don't have the heart of a champion. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3273.12s)]
*  But when you when you write it, when you won the title last year, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3275.36s)]
*  like literally 12 months ago, a lot of injuries, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3280.52s)]
*  a lot of stuff with their way, a lot of stuff with their way. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3283.96s)]
*  Choose your own adventure of do you want this team's best player to not play? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3287.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you want Posingas to turn into a zombie? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3292.88s)]
*  I will say something about the game one of this series. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3295.4399999999996s)]
*  Rossello hit on it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3299.16s)]
*  And, you know, all the observations he made about how any series goes [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3300.24s)]
*  are obviously correct. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3305.48s)]
*  I will say something about this game. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3306.48s)]
*  Now, I was watching it at Bill's house. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3308.2s)]
*  I had stopped and started talking to Ben about Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3310.0s)]
*  That's how over the game was. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3314.48s)]
*  I was just going 50s and 60s. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3316.2s)]
*  I think the Knicks were listening to you talk to him. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3318.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3321.6s)]
*  I was being me and Ben were having a deep conversation [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3322.6s)]
*  about the civil rights movement and all of this stuff. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3325.44s)]
*  Ben's asking all of the questions. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3328.92s)]
*  I'm going to put a coofie on his head. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3330.2799999999997s)]
*  He's doing it in history. So, yeah. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3331.52s)]
*  No, don't don't. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3333.12s)]
*  I'm just saying he's interested, Bill, because you asked him what he's studying. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3335.12s)]
*  And he was like, I'm doing history. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3339.68s)]
*  Here's here's what we're working on now. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3341.08s)]
*  And the Knicks were getting whatever was going on. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3343.2799999999997s)]
*  It really happened. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3345.7999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. No, actually, what happened was Ben was like, I'm doing history. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3347.12s)]
*  No, actually, what happened was Ben came down and he went, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3351.3599999999997s)]
*  Yo, Unc, how do we subvert the white power system? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3353.8399999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, sit down, young man. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3356.48s)]
*  Let me tell you about. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3358.16s)]
*  Ben, I was just listening to Brand Nubian. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3360.64s)]
*  First of all, people sleep on that. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3362.3599999999997s)]
*  So, look, that's how over the game was. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3367.68s)]
*  And Bill, who was, you know, concentrating on basketball at some point, goes, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3369.52s)]
*  I don't know, it's a seven point game. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  I was in a conversation. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3374.7999999999997s)]
*  It went from 19105 to 1912. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3376.2799999999997s)]
*  Bill can't win right here. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3378.52s)]
*  Either you're dismissing a complicated history amongst our people [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3379.8s)]
*  or you're not doing your job. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3383.7200000000003s)]
*  I said, guys, the Knicks are only a seven now. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3385.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't know what's happening. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3388.0800000000004s)]
*  And at a certain point, when they lost that game. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3389.6800000000003s)]
*  You know how individual players turn into pumpkins? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3393.92s)]
*  It felt like the Knicks aura turned into a pumpkin right there. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3398.0s)]
*  That was like three losses because it was so gut wrenching [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3403.2000000000003s)]
*  that it's shifted the little team of destiny thing [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3407.52s)]
*  and the momentum from that being a Knicks thing to it being a Pacers thing. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3411.7200000000003s)]
*  I was like, whoa, wow, this is a game that in the last series they managed to win. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3415.64s)]
*  They managed to pull off and they didn't pull off. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3420.52s)]
*  They didn't pull this game off here. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3423.52s)]
*  They will probably lose this series is the way I looked at it [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3424.7200000000003s)]
*  after that game was over and they were playing from way behind. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3428.48s)]
*  Yeah, it for the rest of the time. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3432.6s)]
*  So I saw it. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3435.2s)]
*  So so that to me was the moment that it was it was a huge moment in that series. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3435.96s)]
*  And if they do win that game, I feel like the momentum that they carried on [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3440.72s)]
*  from the Celtic series would probably make them a much tougher out [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3443.68s)]
*  over the course of the next five or six games. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3448.4s)]
*  So that's the biggest case for the under react, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3450.64s)]
*  because this happened to two other times, like basically in the last 20 years. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3453.48s)]
*  And I went to one of the games, which was 2018 finals, game one, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3457.84s)]
*  which is the greatest game I ever saw LeBron player, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3461.2799999999997s)]
*  maybe anyone play. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3464.32s)]
*  He was he was just beating the Warriors by himself. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3465.32s)]
*  Now it's the J.R. Smith game. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3468.76s)]
*  And it goes in overtime and they lose. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3470.88s)]
*  And I don't know if they were going to beat the Warriors in a seven game series, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3473.48s)]
*  but they weren't going to beat him five out of seven times. Right. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3478.4s)]
*  And you could see LeBron, he was so mad in the last minute of overtime. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3482.16s)]
*  He almost got in the fight with Curry. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3486.52s)]
*  He was so mad because he knew it was like, we can't win the series now. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3489.16s)]
*  We're never winning. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3493.28s)]
*  We're never beating these teams four times when we gave one away. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3494.48s)]
*  The other one we've talked about before was that 2008 Spurs sons, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3497.36s)]
*  which was an awesome game. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3502.52s)]
*  It was the year the sons got Shaq and when Spurs [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3503.6000000000004s)]
*  winning overtime or maybe it was double overtime. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3508.36s)]
*  And you just felt like, I don't think the sons can beat that team. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3510.8s)]
*  For four times after blowing that game. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3514.96s)]
*  So with the Knicks, like if they win game one, maybe that does flip it. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3518.6000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's what you'd have to talk yourself into. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3522.44s)]
*  With that said, if I, if you had, if you told me. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3524.5200000000004s)]
*  Is Tibbs coming back, is Tibbs not coming back, you have to bet on this. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3529.6800000000003s)]
*  I think I would bet on him not coming back. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3533.76s)]
*  And I think I would bet on them finding somebody else. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3536.48s)]
*  And I don't know who that is, but I think it's like 45%, 55%. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3539.84s)]
*  It's in that range. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3544.5600000000004s)]
*  But I just feel like somebody is going to get blamed because the deeper [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3545.44s)]
*  issues are how far they're falling behind every game. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3549.24s)]
*  And it was starting to get a little fluky with the comebacks. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3552.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's how you have to look at a big picture. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3555.0s)]
*  There's a Yanis piece. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3557.4399999999996s)]
*  We still don't know with Yanis. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3559.6s)]
*  I still think Milwaukee should keep them. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3560.8399999999997s)]
*  And until Yanis says, trade me and I want to go there. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3563.7999999999997s)]
*  And that might be Golden State. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3567.04s)]
*  That might be the Knicks. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3568.3199999999997s)]
*  That might be, who knows? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3569.2799999999997s)]
*  He might be Houston. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3570.4399999999996s)]
*  Sounds great. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3571.2s)]
*  Or he might say, I don't want to go anywhere, but if Yanis says, I want to go [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3572.48s)]
*  to the Knicks, there are trades you could figure out with that. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3575.64s)]
*  So that's the only real blow up trade. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3578.92s)]
*  Russell is smiling. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3582.2400000000002s)]
*  You're acting like you don't have four of these written down. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3584.64s)]
*  Well, I do. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3587.48s)]
*  Let me throw this at you. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3590.04s)]
*  Let me throw this one at you. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3592.2000000000003s)]
*  Towns for Durant. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3596.2400000000002s)]
*  I think Durant has a year left, but you can extend them. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3601.44s)]
*  The salaries actually work as a one for one. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3604.36s)]
*  Towns, if you remember, has a whole friendship history with Booker. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3606.6s)]
*  Like they've known each other since they were kids. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3610.7999999999997s)]
*  They have the same agent. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3612.7999999999997s)]
*  There was a, I remember we got pitched this at the Ringer in 2019. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3614.56s)]
*  Towns and Booker and Russell all wanted to do a podcast together and they all lived [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3619.52s)]
*  in different places and we were like, there's no way, but like now we would have [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3624.2799999999997s)]
*  the technology, D'Angelo Russell, your guy. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3627.2s)]
*  Oh, those three guys are all friends together and same agency, all that stuff. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3629.88s)]
*  And I'm thinking if they don't have a ton of outs with Durant, and if you're the [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3633.4s)]
*  sons, you don't have a lot of ways to get better and you want like in Booker loves [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3636.2000000000003s)]
*  towns and I think they're still buddies. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3639.88s)]
*  Is that a way to get out of the Durant business? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3642.84s)]
*  And then if you're the next, you have this one year run with Durant, you can talk [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3645.0s)]
*  yourself into Mitchell Robinson, 30 minutes a game. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3648.7200000000003s)]
*  You're out of the town's defense business. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3653.28s)]
*  You've kind of sold high. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3656.84s)]
*  You got out of rando. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3658.28s)]
*  You got out of towns with the Durant. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3659.4s)]
*  You got out of rando. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3661.08s)]
*  You got out of towns with this big contract coming. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3662.16s)]
*  Priscilla, is that something that would intrigue you if you were the Knicks? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3664.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3669.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh, I think I'm more into it if I'm on the Knicks side of this thing. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3670.28s)]
*  And I think it is worth in this kind of like, I think we're all being pretty [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3673.48s)]
*  positive here about the Knicks because I don't really know how you get, I mean, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3676.28s)]
*  you can be disappointed, but I don't know that you can be mad about. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3679.32s)]
*  Anything that's happened this season. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3683.44s)]
*  This has been a great season. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3685.04s)]
*  I think how it played out with Cleveland falling apart and then the Knicks [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3687.12s)]
*  taking boss now and you get to take Boston on top of everything else. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3690.72s)]
*  You know, literally out like out maybe for the decade. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3693.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3697.2799999999997s)]
*  That'd be long, but we'll see. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3698.0s)]
*  Um, but I wanted to add in just the Mitchell Robinson part of it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3699.9599999999996s)]
*  I think I get why I am bead stepped on him last year. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3704.8799999999997s)]
*  Like maybe I'm bead was smarter than everybody else and realizing like, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3708.2s)]
*  Hey, when this dude is out there, he's a problem. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3711.3599999999997s)]
*  Even though I probably focused on, you know, I just don't like guys that are [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3714.3999999999996s)]
*  a zero threat on offense. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3718.48s)]
*  And then I always thought it was odd with him where he'd be complaining on [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3720.44s)]
*  Instagram, like every now and then van, he would have like a post where it's [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3723.2000000000003s)]
*  like, I'm not just here to rebound or something like, dude, there's a lot. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3726.52s)]
*  Let me cook. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3729.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3731.36s)]
*  I don't like like dudes that cannot don't have a kitchen asking to cook at [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3732.7200000000003s)]
*  the NBA level and I saw him what in the LA fitness run, he looked really good. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3738.56s)]
*  Uh, I think my dad was playing in that game. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3742.52s)]
*  So look, I, I would be more into this thing. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3744.3199999999997s)]
*  I think this is really interesting because you're like, all right, Mitchell's [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3749.2799999999997s)]
*  there, it's it Durant, I think it's probably a better happy destination. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3751.7999999999997s)]
*  Cause I think I'd always be worried. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3755.8799999999997s)]
*  He's like, all right, I'm getting Durant. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3756.96s)]
*  Like what's the expiration date on his happiness here? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3758.08s)]
*  Because there seems to be a bit of a track record with that. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3761.24s)]
*  Sure. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3763.72s)]
*  He's a little bit older. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3763.9199999999996s)]
*  Um, the cat 61 million years from now, I think it's alarming, but it's also, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3765.12s)]
*  what will it look like in relation to what other salaries are going to be? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3769.68s)]
*  If this cap goes up 10% every single year. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3772.52s)]
*  So that's another factor with that. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3774.84s)]
*  If I'm Phoenix, I'm probably going to have to reset this around Booker. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3776.48s)]
*  If he's cool with going through that, which again, it seems like all indications [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3780.12s)]
*  that, um, you know, he's probably a little bit more bought in than you would [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3784.68s)]
*  think from the outside, but that might be something where you're delaying it all [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3788.32s)]
*  around him, cause you're bringing in a more expensive, younger flawed player. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3793.6s)]
*  Then what should probably be a quicker reset on Phoenix. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3797.6s)]
*  Like Phoenix seems like they don't want to get this over with, but it probably [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3800.2s)]
*  means Durant's moving out and then they're rebuilding around this whole thing. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3805.0s)]
*  I don't know that I'd want to be in the cat business for four years. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3808.08s)]
*  I look, isn't a side case for the cat business though. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3810.48s)]
*  Quick. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3813.2799999999997s)]
*  I can't stand watching him play a basketball game and that is unfair to him [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3813.48s)]
*  and his production. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3819.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, his plus minus regular season is the most frustrating guy. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3820.44s)]
*  I can't fucking stand it. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3823.3199999999997s)]
*  And I know it's better than I'm giving it credit for. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3827.56s)]
*  So that's a me problem. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3830.56s)]
*  I need to work on me. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3831.7999999999997s)]
*  Good basketball player. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3832.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3833.8799999999997s)]
*  He's really good. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3834.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, he's got some major flaws, but he has to be in the top 20 of any. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3835.56s)]
*  If you're making a basketball list, he's one of the 20 best players in the league. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3839.44s)]
*  And he's been conference finals, conference finals, conference finals, two years in a [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3842.48s)]
*  row on different teams. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3847.16s)]
*  So it's not like you can't succeed with them. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3849.3599999999997s)]
*  And that would be the case van be like, we get out of this to ramp business. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  He's leaving in a year anyway, instead of like getting this three for one, two for [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3854.44s)]
*  one, we're getting a top 20 guy back from him who our best player really likes. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3859.04s)]
*  And we could maybe redo this any place center and he rebounds and he's 24 and 13 [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3864.12s)]
*  every game and he's had real success. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3868.0s)]
*  I mean, look, it on the, I'm pretty much aligned with Rosillo on the Phoenix part [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3871.2799999999997s)]
*  of it. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3875.52s)]
*  I like it a lot less on the New York, New York part of it. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3875.72s)]
*  It seems like it makes a lot of sense. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3879.08s)]
*  It seems like it gives them flexibility in the future to build the type of team [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3880.2s)]
*  that they want to eventually, you know, give it a, get over the hump for the [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3884.56s)]
*  first time since like 1972 or whatever it is. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3887.68s)]
*  I will say this though, like the tips part of it is interesting to me because [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3890.24s)]
*  for as much success of these as they've had his style of basketball and his [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3895.8399999999997s)]
*  overall being great on people, it wears on people. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3901.48s)]
*  He grinds out a fan base and you normally don't see a fan base that like has been [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3905.52s)]
*  in the doldrums and has had the success that the Knicks have had over the past [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3911.16s)]
*  year, this year, like really want to move on from their coaches. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3915.7599999999998s)]
*  Like he is the ultimate fair weather type of Knicks figure. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3919.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like we're winning games. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3924.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, Tibbs might be able to stick around. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3926.68s)]
*  Look at what he's able to do. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3928.3199999999997s)]
*  But Tibbs drives me crazy. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3929.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3930.7599999999998s)]
*  And so, and so now I think that if you, as most Knicks fans, they want a fresh [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3931.2s)]
*  coat of paint on their head coaching position. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3936.9199999999996s)]
*  And I don't, and that's despite all of the success, they don't believe that they [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3940.3199999999997s)]
*  can win with the way Tibbs does the things that he does. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3944.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, the case against Tibbs is the thing. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3947.92s)]
*  And we've talked about it on a few pods, even before these playoffs. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3952.2s)]
*  Why is he doing the minutes this way? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3956.0s)]
*  What's the point of this? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3958.8s)]
*  And then you get to the playoffs and he completely flips how he's doing the [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3961.0s)]
*  minutes and all of a sudden starts playing guys who hadn't played forever, who [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3964.52s)]
*  were actually pretty good off the bench. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3968.4s)]
*  And it's like, why not use the regular season to try more different, you know, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3970.7999999999997s)]
*  more lineups, different combinations, get people out there. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3975.16s)]
*  And then when you get to the playoffs, you're in a firm position of strength. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3980.0s)]
*  And instead it felt like he was throwing shit against the wall. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3983.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think that would be the biggest criticism with them. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3986.24s)]
*  It's like, yeah, of course this wasn't sustainable. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3989.24s)]
*  You're trying to win a title with six guys too hard for four straight rounds. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3991.72s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3996.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, seven guys, I mean, miles was, but he kind of lost it. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=3997.2799999999997s)]
*  Seemed like he lost confidence in miles as it went along. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4002.4399999999996s)]
*  Um, so if you honestly asked for a next trade, listen, I was on the trade machine. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4005.0s)]
*  I put on my trade machine outfit, put on my goggles, my overalls, fireproof, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4010.4399999999996s)]
*  fireproof overalls, my painter's cap. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4016.56s)]
*  It's really hard and it has to be a three teamer. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4020.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think it's got to be towns and OG together and towns and bridges together. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4023.28s)]
*  And you need a third team. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4026.92s)]
*  And I think the third team would have to be the Spurs and the Spurs would be [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4028.44s)]
*  getting either OG or bridges. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4032.28s)]
*  I think, I think the bucks end up with towns and Visell and multiple first [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4035.0s)]
*  round picks from, from San Antonio. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4039.52s)]
*  And then the Knicks would get Giannis, but they would have to take a couple [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4043.1200000000003s)]
*  contracts, they'd have to take Conantin and they'd have to take Kuzma. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4045.92s)]
*  And I don't think this will happen because if I'm walking, I just want to [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4049.2400000000002s)]
*  do it. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4051.84s)]
*  I'd rather, I'd rather keep Giannis, take them into February. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4052.32s)]
*  And if we have to trade a man, I just feel like I have more leverage at that point. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4056.56s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4061.1600000000003s)]
*  I would not trade Giannis. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4061.8s)]
*  I am on the record. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4063.7200000000003s)]
*  I'd the East is weak. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4064.7200000000003s)]
*  I'd keep them. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4066.0s)]
*  He might be the best player in the whole conference. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4067.52s)]
*  Keep them, figure it out. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4069.28s)]
*  Indiana has shown you that maybe if you build the right team around a great [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4070.84s)]
*  player, you can move your timeline faster than you thought. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4073.92s)]
*  So I would not trade him. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4077.6800000000003s)]
*  Would you? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4078.88s)]
*  What would, what would happen for you to have to trade him or so? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4079.44s)]
*  What would you need? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4082.1600000000003s)]
*  Just like the, be overpowered with picks? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4082.84s)]
*  What would it be? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4085.04s)]
*  Before the combine, you and I, your statement there, I have absolute [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4086.7200000000003s)]
*  agreement with after the combine. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4089.88s)]
*  I would just get it over with now. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4091.48s)]
*  Cause I think at this point you can get a ton for him. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4093.0s)]
*  I think if it gets weirder, whether it's before the deadline or it's next summer, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4096.32s)]
*  I don't know that the value is going to be the same. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4099.88s)]
*  And we can talk about the time out of the contract and control, which is also a [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4101.52s)]
*  factor here, but I'd say that the time out of the contract is going to be the same. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4104.52s)]
*  They didn't have to move one lesson later on about buttercream making. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4108.46s)]
*  They might move one lesson, you know, before eight, nine, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4111.68s)]
*  Baby. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4114.96s)]
*  The news out of that kind of statement isn't really necessary, um, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4115.4s)]
*  because it, it helps climate change with great communication. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4118.84s)]
*  Um, I think that's really the key, is where you are. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4122.24s)]
*  It's not been up even� [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4125.56s)]
*  much, unless it's definitely favoring a more flowers. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4126.88s)]
*  Uh, there's really no reason for that. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4131.76s)]
*  There's no reason for legal interaction. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4133.32s)]
*  You know, and I'm the guy that I think is here, it's so I don't [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4135.4s)]
*  totally aligned with you, Bill. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4137.88s)]
*  If he's happy and wants to come back, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4139.02s)]
*  that's all I need to know. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4140.42s)]
*  You're absolutely right about the East. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4141.28s)]
*  I mean, if Yanis ends up in the West after the lottery, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4143.18s)]
*  and my God, this East West thing, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4145.86s)]
*  we're gonna need a summit for this. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4149.7s)]
*  If I'm Yanis, I don't wanna go to the West. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4151.06s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't wanna go to the West either. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4153.42s)]
*  You wanna do the LeBron. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4155.18s)]
*  LeBron was smart enough in the 2010s [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4156.26s)]
*  to realize, better conference, I should stay here. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4159.14s)]
*  To me, obviously, if he wants out, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4163.66s)]
*  so are you saying that you wouldn't trade him [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4166.320000000001s)]
*  even if he asked out? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4168.28s)]
*  Are you saying that you'd hold on to him [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4169.84s)]
*  even if you said, I wanna get outta here? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4171.96s)]
*  So here's how the league works. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4173.68s)]
*  If he does ask out, he will tell them, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4175.4400000000005s)]
*  these are the three teams I will go to. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4178.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4180.8s)]
*  And then you work with the deal with those. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4181.64s)]
*  They're not gonna trade him to somewhere [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4182.88s)]
*  he doesn't wanna go. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4184.4800000000005s)]
*  They're like, hey, OKC just blew the finals. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4185.320000000001s)]
*  We've traded you to OKC. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4188.320000000001s)]
*  You'll be like, I didn't wanna go to OKC. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4189.8s)]
*  They're gonna work with him. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4191.54s)]
*  So if he says, I wanna go to Golden State, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4192.76s)]
*  they'll go down the road and really try to figure out [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4197.28s)]
*  the Golden State thing. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4199.4400000000005s)]
*  And Golden State, literally everybody would be [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4200.28s)]
*  on the table for them. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4202.64s)]
*  But if he gives them a list of Golden State, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4204.08s)]
*  Houston, San Antonio, the Knicks, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4207.28s)]
*  then you just basically pit all those four people [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4210.0s)]
*  against each other and try to figure it out. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4212.2s)]
*  We saw this with Durant a couple years ago [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4214.02s)]
*  where Brooklyn could've just traded Durant, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4216.72s)]
*  but they actually, he's like, I really wanna go to Phoenix. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4219.12s)]
*  And they were like, cool. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4221.88s)]
*  Their owner's insane. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4223.96s)]
*  He's gonna give us 230 cents on the dollar. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4225.06s)]
*  So this works out great. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4227.54s)]
*  I don't know if that's gonna be the case [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4229.78s)]
*  for 31-year-old Giannis. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4231.26s)]
*  I think Golden State, because they have urgency, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4234.9s)]
*  would overpay. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4236.66s)]
*  And I think the Knicks would do everything possible [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4237.86s)]
*  to make it happen. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4240.78s)]
*  Because if the Knicks could just end up with Giannis [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4241.62s)]
*  and Brunson in one of the swings, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4244.92s)]
*  you just figure it out after that, right? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4247.82s)]
*  You have to do that. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4250.34s)]
*  The title is the thing that makes it interesting [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4251.9s)]
*  with Giannis to me. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4253.82s)]
*  He was able to stay there long enough [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4255.719999999999s)]
*  and actually deliver a title for the team [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4257.44s)]
*  that drafted him, right? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4260.16s)]
*  And so at this point, giving him the right trade [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4261.96s)]
*  does two things for them. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4266.4s)]
*  Or like observing his wishes, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4267.719999999999s)]
*  meeting his wishes does two things. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4273.24s)]
*  Number one, it lows you back up [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4274.7s)]
*  to maybe go get another player [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4276.5599999999995s)]
*  that you can get another title with. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4277.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, they had one in so long, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4279.5199999999995s)]
*  have been basketball relevant so long, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4280.84s)]
*  they just owe him a lot. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4282.62s)]
*  Like Giannis is the Bucs right now, that's number one. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4284.16s)]
*  And then number two, you say goodbye to him in a way [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4286.78s)]
*  that's not really contentious, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4289.76s)]
*  and lets him go start over [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4291.96s)]
*  and try to do it with another franchise, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4294.3s)]
*  and you get what you want. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4296.48s)]
*  Like you don't drag this out [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4297.5199999999995s)]
*  and make this into a situation where he's unhappy [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4298.9s)]
*  or where people are looking at Milwaukee as a place [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4302.46s)]
*  where there's unhappiness in the organization. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4305.16s)]
*  If he asks out, you brought us a title, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4307.92s)]
*  we had great memories the whole deal, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4310.320000000001s)]
*  goodbye, let's start over, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4312.76s)]
*  and we have everything that we're gonna get back [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4314.8s)]
*  from the trade to build and try to get back there again [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4317.84s)]
*  in four or five years. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4320.6s)]
*  He's not asked out. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4321.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4323.64s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4325.62s)]
*  All right, we're gonna take a break [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4326.46s)]
*  and a lot more stuff to hit. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4327.28s)]
*  This episode is presented by State Farm. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4329.16s)]

*  And when it comes to insurance, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4335.4800000000005s)]

*  State Farm with the assist. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4351.54s)]
*  Coverage options are selected by the customer availability [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4353.34s)]
*  and the eligibility vary by state. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4356.1s)]
*  So Inside the NBA had its last TNT show today, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4358.9400000000005s)]
*  and it's been like almost a year plus funeral [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4363.22s)]
*  for this show on TNT, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4366.240000000001s)]
*  dating back to last year's playoffs [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4367.8s)]
*  when it seemed like it was heading goodbye, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4369.679999999999s)]
*  even though they had a year left. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4371.12s)]
*  And then we did that whole thing. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4372.28s)]
*  They did documentary. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4373.5199999999995s)]
*  And yet it's just moving to ESPN. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4375.16s)]
*  It's not dying. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4377.16s)]
*  And so on the one hand, I felt sad [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4379.28s)]
*  as a lifelong basketball fan. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4382.0s)]
*  TNT was such a huge part, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4384.24s)]
*  dating back to when, you know, 30 years ago, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4386.12s)]
*  however long it was, like, you know, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4389.08s)]
*  living in Massachusetts, watching that show, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4391.8s)]
*  those games, seeing Barkley join in 2000, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4395.96s)]
*  you have this whole history. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4398.719999999999s)]
*  The three guys together were the best. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4400.639999999999s)]
*  They add Shaq and it goes terrible for a year. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4402.719999999999s)]
*  Then it eventually becomes good. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4404.759999999999s)]
*  And there was such an essential part [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4406.679999999999s)]
*  of being basketball fans. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4409.0s)]
*  And it's still gonna continue on ESPN. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4413.2s)]
*  And yet. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4416.96s)]
*  And yet. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4419.48s)]
*  Just say what you wanna say. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4421.32s)]
*  I think ESPN's gonna fuck the show up. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4423.2s)]
*  I don't care if I get aggregated. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4425.24s)]
*  I didn't understand. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4426.5s)]
*  I think they're gonna fuck the show up. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4428.139999999999s)]
*  I don't think they, unless they completely change [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4430.3s)]
*  how they do commercials, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4433.38s)]
*  the show is gonna be different [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4435.94s)]
*  and people are gonna be pissed [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4437.5s)]
*  and Barkley and those guys are gonna be pissed. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4438.86s)]
*  And I think it's gonna go badly. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4440.58s)]
*  The only way it doesn't go badly [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4441.92s)]
*  is if they do the commercials [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4443.78s)]
*  and they give them the lengthy segments [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4445.78s)]
*  that you need to have that show work, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4448.86s)]
*  they're gonna have to change how they do it. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4451.58s)]
*  They just paid so much for the NBA [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4453.820000000001s)]
*  that if they don't do that [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4456.54s)]
*  and they do these same short, terrible segments [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4457.78s)]
*  that you're about to see in the finals [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4459.9400000000005s)]
*  where it's like a one and a half minute halftime [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4461.38s)]
*  and it's like a 20 minute pregame. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4463.900000000001s)]
*  If they do that, they're gonna fuck the show up [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4466.34s)]
*  and everybody's gonna be bad. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4468.3s)]
*  So I'm gonna start there, Rosilla. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4470.18s)]
*  They did pay a lot for the NBA. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4473.18s)]
*  So then to say now all of a sudden [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4476.1s)]
*  you're not gonna have all that commercial inventory. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4477.860000000001s)]
*  Because we've talked about the halftime show ESPN [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4480.18s)]
*  with people that we really like that are on the show, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4483.080000000001s)]
*  maybe others that aren't necessarily our favorites. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4485.56s)]
*  But I barely catch it. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4487.8s)]
*  That's the 15 minute timer [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4489.8s)]
*  to get something done around the house for me. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4491.120000000001s)]
*  And if I do catch some of it, it's just a lot. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4495.360000000001s)]
*  It's like, oh, the best player on the team went two for 10. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4497.84s)]
*  Somebody's gotta step up. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4500.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's gonna get scolded. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4501.88s)]
*  Okay, here we go, it's a 30 second scolding. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4504.4400000000005s)]
*  And then I don't know who okayed, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4507.360000000001s)]
*  maybe it was because everybody was trying to be the TNT show, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4509.76s)]
*  but the analysts talking to break, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4512.14s)]
*  nobody's good at it, folks. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4517.56s)]
*  Nobody's good at it. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4520.200000000001s)]
*  It's just confusing. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4521.52s)]
*  You're like, are we in commercial [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4522.96s)]
*  or are we doing Carl's Jr.? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4524.88s)]
*  I don't understand what's going on. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4526.320000000001s)]
*  It started with PTI 25 years ago [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4528.160000000001s)]
*  and they're the only ones who are really good at it. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4529.72s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4531.9400000000005s)]
*  That's it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4532.780000000001s)]
*  Little history lesson. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4533.62s)]
*  I actually think the people that are at the very top [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4538.08s)]
*  of the ESPN know this. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4541.48s)]
*  They haven't cared, whoever's running ESPN [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4545.7s)]
*  has not cared for this entire century about this. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4548.0199999999995s)]
*  This is something they knew was a problem [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4551.0199999999995s)]
*  and they just didn't care. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4552.74s)]
*  They just cashed the checks from the commercials. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4553.86s)]
*  Yeah, but I asked you. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4555.9s)]
*  They did not care about the quality of any show they had. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4556.74s)]
*  All right, but if it's gonna be on the model [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4559.2s)]
*  of like, we bring it in but you get to do your thing, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4561.82s)]
*  then don't you think that's the negotiation? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4565.219999999999s)]
*  Don't you think that's part of it to even give this? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4568.179999999999s)]
*  I think you could say that coming out of the gate. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4570.160000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, no, it's gonna be the same. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4572.96s)]
*  And then you get there and I've literally witnessed this [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4575.240000000001s)]
*  in situations I've been in. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4579.280000000001s)]
*  Once you're actually there, it's like, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4580.84s)]
*  oh yeah, that halftime's coming now. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4583.200000000001s)]
*  Be a minute and a half because we got this job. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4586.280000000001s)]
*  I don't think they're gonna do that, man. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4588.8s)]
*  I don't think they're gonna do that. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4590.160000000001s)]
*  They've done it this whole century is my point. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4592.64s)]
*  So they were gonna have to completely shift [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4595.240000000001s)]
*  what their business model is to accommodate the show [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4597.240000000001s)]
*  and that's the only way it's gonna work. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4599.44s)]
*  Otherwise, we're all gonna be mad. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4600.54s)]
*  But this is like the situation when one of your homeboys [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4602.66s)]
*  starts dating a girl that you actually care about [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4606.419999999999s)]
*  and have respect for and you warn him, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4609.259999999999s)]
*  don't fuck this one up. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4612.66s)]
*  Like as your cousin or somebody like that. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4615.599999999999s)]
*  I know how you are, I know how you treat all the other girls [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4617.94s)]
*  that have been around, but don't fuck this one up. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4620.58s)]
*  We're paying attention to you now. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4623.24s)]
*  I think before they could do whatever they wanted to do [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4625.219999999999s)]
*  with these various shows because nobody really cared [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4628.42s)]
*  how these shows were treated. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4631.6s)]
*  Nobody really cared whether or not you called these shows [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4633.32s)]
*  back, whether or not you took them to Cut or TGI Fridays, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4636.64s)]
*  what kind of hotels you guys were staying in. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4641.72s)]
*  No one really cared how these shows were treated. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4643.72s)]
*  Now, you're dating a girl from our church, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4645.6s)]
*  you're dating our sister, you're dating our cousin. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4648.56s)]
*  You gotta treat her right or else all eyes are gonna be [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4651.7s)]
*  on her when she starts complaining, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4655.42s)]
*  you're gonna be like, hey man, this is the right, okay? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4656.96s)]
*  We care. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4660.46s)]
*  So I don't think that they'll treat Charles Barkley [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4661.42s)]
*  like anything other than the prom queen. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4664.06s)]
*  For the three of us, it would be more fun if they [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4666.7s)]
*  mistreated him a little bit because he would be the all time, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4670.4s)]
*  I'm going to say my piece about this. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4674.7s)]
*  I don't like how this is going. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4677.02s)]
*  Here are my thoughts on multiple platforms. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4678.38s)]
*  That happened to me once, Van, and the guy was married. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4682.5s)]
*  I was like, you can eat all the dicks. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4684.9s)]
*  This has been a weird thing though because [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4687.86s)]
*  there was all this stuff said and you all know [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4694.14s)]
*  Barkley's my forever number one. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4697.02s)]
*  There's never, never gonna happen. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4698.82s)]
*  The greatest guest of all time too. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4700.94s)]
*  Well, he's my favorite athlete. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4703.1s)]
*  There will never be anybody that I'll care more about [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4704.38s)]
*  as an athlete than him. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4706.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it'd be weird at this stage of my life. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4709.18s)]
*  Like, nope, I'm moving this guy up. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4711.06s)]
*  I mean, unless I had a kid, but even he'd have a hard time [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4713.14s)]
*  because it's like, I doubt you're gonna be as good as Barkley. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4715.68s)]
*  This is tough for Chris Paul to hear this, but go ahead. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4717.48s)]
*  Chris knows. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4720.04s)]
*  We talked about it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4723.36s)]
*  Yeah, I've told him. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4724.48s)]
*  He's fine with it. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4725.8s)]
*  He's a competitive guy, but yeah, he's, that's it. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4727.5599999999995s)]
*  But Barkley was like, if I might sign, I might not sign. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4730.28s)]
*  Barkley wasn't dumb about it, but he was doing [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4734.72s)]
*  almost a book tour with his contract negotiations. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4738.5599999999995s)]
*  Remember the Liv thing was getting involved [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4742.04s)]
*  and that stuff was happening [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4744.0s)]
*  and that's where some people with their agents, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4745.78s)]
*  they'll get it out there more and more [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4746.86s)]
*  and everybody just starts talking about it. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4748.42s)]
*  Then it's like the Scott Boris thing. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4749.86s)]
*  You're like, we only had to pay this guy [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4751.0599999999995s)]
*  200 million bucks, what a bargain. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4752.219999999999s)]
*  You don't realize it all worked. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4754.62s)]
*  Ernie hits that he'd never work anywhere ever [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4756.54s)]
*  other than TNT and if the show wasn't on TNT, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4759.42s)]
*  then he was done. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4761.74s)]
*  I've been confused about this show so many fucking times [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4762.82s)]
*  where I thought last year I was like, this is it? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4766.54s)]
*  And then you have to look it up. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4769.719999999999s)]
*  Then there's another year left. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4771.54s)]
*  There's another year, but the rights, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4773.040000000001s)]
*  but now if it goes here and then it's like, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4775.56s)]
*  no, we're just running it back. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4777.88s)]
*  Three of them are like, we haven't signed deals yet. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4779.360000000001s)]
*  It's like, so you don't have the show? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4781.4800000000005s)]
*  Barkley's saying he'll never do it again [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4783.4400000000005s)]
*  anywhere else other than TNT. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4785.400000000001s)]
*  So I've made my peace with the fact that it's over, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4786.92s)]
*  but no, it's not over. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4788.88s)]
*  I actually didn't know that they were moving to ESPN [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4790.4400000000005s)]
*  as a unit to maybe like two, three weeks ago. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4793.6s)]
*  I literally thought the show was over. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4796.42s)]
*  Because they keep saying it all the time. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4799.0s)]
*  I'm totally with you, Van, and on top of everything else. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4801.740000000001s)]
*  And look, I would laugh about it, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4804.34s)]
*  but Barkley dumps on ESPN all the time. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4805.62s)]
*  Kills them. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4808.740000000001s)]
*  They did it last night. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4809.58s)]
*  Kills them. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4811.54s)]
*  That's the interesting thing to me. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4812.820000000001s)]
*  He's been shitting on them so hard [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4814.62s)]
*  for like the last 10 years, tough. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4818.1s)]
*  So now for them to be over there, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4821.18s)]
*  that's so fucking interesting to me. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4822.780000000001s)]
*  But it also speaks to like Jimmy Pataro running the thing, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4824.780000000001s)]
*  going, hey, this is a great product. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4827.7s)]
*  This is better than anything we've had. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4829.66s)]
*  This has been the gold standard. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4831.14s)]
*  This is what every single new studio show, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4832.280000000001s)]
*  when you sit in on these meetings, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4834.0s)]
*  and I would be in tests of these shows, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4835.400000000001s)]
*  and like we wanna be more like TNT. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4837.52s)]
*  We wanna be more like inside the NBA. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4839.56s)]
*  It's like, all right, yeah, well, good luck. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4841.240000000001s)]
*  How about you let somebody be on these shows [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4843.12s)]
*  more than 12 months and then see what happens? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4844.8s)]
*  And granted, like- [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4848.76s)]
*  Well, also, how about you give them time [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4849.6s)]
*  to actually relate with one another. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4850.64s)]
*  They've done some of the pregame stuff they've made longer, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4853.52s)]
*  but the during the game stuff, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4855.860000000001s)]
*  and then the postgame goes right to Van Pelt. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4857.660000000001s)]
*  So there is no postgame show, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4859.68s)]
*  and that's why you have these shows, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4860.88s)]
*  because the game just happened, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4862.58s)]
*  and then we wanna hear from the best possible people [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4864.12s)]
*  talking about the game. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4866.82s)]
*  And where they shifted it was they want SportsCenter. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4868.38s)]
*  The real secret sauce, the ESPN, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4871.58s)]
*  is they're trying to drive as much revenue [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4873.18s)]
*  to SportsCenter as possible. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4876.14s)]
*  So the faster that they can have that SportsCenter [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4877.88s)]
*  follow the end of the game, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4880.22s)]
*  that boosts the rating for that SportsCenter, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4882.5s)]
*  and then they can get, that's 365 days a year, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4884.74s)]
*  they can just get more money for it. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4887.54s)]
*  That's not gonna work with Inside the NBA. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4889.72s)]
*  So I don't know, I guess that SportsCenter just goes away [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4891.5199999999995s)]
*  and they move Inside the NBA in there [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4895.88s)]
*  was the only way that would work, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4897.599999999999s)]
*  because that's what the fans are gonna want. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4898.72s)]
*  If they mess with any piece of this, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4900.44s)]
*  everyone's gonna be mad. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4902.36s)]
*  And that's the part that I can't wait to watch. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4904.2s)]
*  Even little insignificant stuff, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4906.599999999999s)]
*  if we feel like it's different anyway, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4908.5599999999995s)]
*  people will be mad, and that's it. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4910.16s)]
*  I don't know how it plays out. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4913.5199999999995s)]
*  They have to do, legitimately, the exact same show. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4914.92s)]
*  Replica. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4918.9400000000005s)]
*  Underdog, everybody, the tweets, the golf, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4920.22s)]
*  they have to do the exact same show. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4924.78s)]
*  Well, it seems like they're hiring the same crew, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4927.3s)]
*  everybody's coming, and that was a big part for Barclay. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4929.06s)]
*  Right, so if any part of it doesn't, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4932.42s)]
*  if any part of it, I'm being serious too, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4936.42s)]
*  if any part of it doesn't move, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4939.9400000000005s)]
*  hashtag not my Inside the NBA, it's going to start. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4941.7s)]
*  I have a question. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4947.36s)]
*  How does Stephen A. figure into all of this stuff? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4949.08s)]
*  They already took care of that with the deal. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4951.92s)]
*  That deal's for first take, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4955.04s)]
*  and he gets his own stuff and gets to do his own. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4957.28s)]
*  I think they knew when they were doing the deal, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4960.679999999999s)]
*  you're not gonna be in NBA next year in the same way. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4962.24s)]
*  But I'm asking, how does this impact his acting? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4964.76s)]
*  Is he... [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4967.8s)]
*  Well, that we're gonna have to wait and see. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4969.639999999999s)]
*  Fair. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4972.36s)]
*  Fair. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4974.099999999999s)]
*  You think, what do you think? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4975.78s)]
*  They're gonna put him on the show every once in a while, Ben? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4976.62s)]
*  I wonder how Stephen A., who is Stephen Naismith, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4980.0599999999995s)]
*  who is the basketball authority at ESPN, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4985.5s)]
*  I wonder how these guys come in, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4989.74s)]
*  who literally have been blamed and lauded [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4991.66s)]
*  for dictating the course of NBA culture. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4996.099999999999s)]
*  At first it was like, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4998.76s)]
*  even when the league was not as fun to watch, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=4999.9s)]
*  these guys would make the league fun. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5003.639999999999s)]
*  Then it was, these guys' criticism of the league [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5006.639999999999s)]
*  is part of a larger problem with basketball culture. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5010.2s)]
*  That's how much influence they have. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5013.219999999999s)]
*  But it didn't really matter to him then, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5015.139999999999s)]
*  because they were on another network. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5016.799999999999s)]
*  But having those kind of guys who is consequential [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5019.12s)]
*  to basketball culture in his same home field, home turf, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5022.9s)]
*  I just wonder how that's gonna go. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5028.16s)]
*  I wonder if a month into this thing, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5029.16s)]
*  we pop up and Stephen A. Smith is sitting up there with them, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5032.16s)]
*  just because he wants to do it. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5034.96s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, there's been so much talked [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5037.0s)]
*  and written about the show, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5040.2s)]
*  there's almost nothing at at this point. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5041.32s)]
*  Everybody understands how consequential the show is. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5042.719999999999s)]
*  I think the most important thing about it, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5045.0s)]
*  I was thinking back to game five, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5047.24s)]
*  and I remember writing about this at the time, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5049.599999999999s)]
*  game five, Cavs-Southwicks 2010, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5051.48s)]
*  when the series was 2-2, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5054.12s)]
*  when the series was 2-2, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5056.36s)]
*  and the Celtics just kind of killed the Cavs in game five. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5057.94s)]
*  And LeBron was bad, and seemed kind of detached, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5061.82s)]
*  and didn't seem like my life's on the line, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5065.98s)]
*  I gotta take care of it. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5068.12s)]
*  It's just something was off the whole game. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5068.96s)]
*  You're watching it going. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5071.12s)]
*  Was this a mom thing? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5071.96s)]
*  No, no, no, this was just, he just wasn't good. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5072.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5076.139999999999s)]
*  And it got to inside the NBA after. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5076.98s)]
*  And Barclay was so disappointed in how LeBron played, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5080.0199999999995s)]
*  like he just started talking about it, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5082.92s)]
*  and he's just like, I just don't understand. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5084.66s)]
*  I'm just so disappointed that LeBron played like that. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5086.38s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff that made the show so essential, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5090.0199999999995s)]
*  because those guys really cared about basketball. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5092.8s)]
*  There would be moments that happened in these playoff games, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5095.4s)]
*  or the end of a series, or whatever, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5097.86s)]
*  these big picture conversations. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5099.9s)]
*  To me, the show's funny as shit. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5103.0599999999995s)]
*  It makes me laugh in a way [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5107.599999999999s)]
*  that I don't think any studio show has, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5109.0199999999995s)]
*  but the way they could capture the moment sometimes [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5110.68s)]
*  was so important, and that's the thing ESPN [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5113.56s)]
*  can't risk with that show. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5116.04s)]
*  You have to have these guys after games, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5117.64s)]
*  weighing in in a big picture on stuff [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5120.56s)]
*  that only really Barclay and Kenny, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5123.360000000001s)]
*  like that's where the show really matters, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5125.8s)]
*  and they can't fuck with it. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5129.280000000001s)]
*  What if they replaced Kenny with Mina Kimes? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5130.700000000001s)]
*  With ESPN people? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5134.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5136.200000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5138.360000000001s)]
*  Just thinking of crossover appeal, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5140.360000000001s)]
*  like off the Stephen A point. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5141.92s)]
*  There's no way Stephen A's not sitting at that desk [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5144.88s)]
*  with those guys at some point. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5147.32s)]
*  There's no way that's not happening. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5148.92s)]
*  It'll be in the pregame, not the postgame. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5150.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, but he will be on there. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5152.4800000000005s)]
*  He will be on there. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5155.4400000000005s)]
*  It's the lock of the year, you can't even bet it. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5156.28s)]
*  He's going to say, I'm going to go on that, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5158.16s)]
*  and it's gonna be really interesting. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5162.08s)]
*  I'm not saying he's gonna now be a part of the show [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5163.92s)]
*  all the time, but the dude wants stuff, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5166.76s)]
*  and it's worked out, and he's not gonna have that show [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5170.74s)]
*  exist without him stopping by for a cameo. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5174.94s)]
*  Well, can we all agree that the more ESPN juice [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5178.54s)]
*  they sprinkle on the show, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5181.139999999999s)]
*  the matter the general public will get? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5182.66s)]
*  Yeah, but that'll be the part that's unfair. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5185.84s)]
*  There'll be no juice. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5187.34s)]
*  There's no remnants of any juice whatsoever, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5188.46s)]
*  and the second something, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5190.42s)]
*  it doesn't even have to be different, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5191.9s)]
*  that people are gonna get on ESPN's case. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5193.4s)]
*  ESPN gets actually too much shit [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5195.3s)]
*  because it's on all of the time, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5198.0199999999995s)]
*  and all of us were on pontificating 24 seven. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5199.86s)]
*  Imagine if CBS or Fox, who's running NFL, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5204.42s)]
*  also had 24 seven programming [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5207.139999999999s)]
*  of people talking about the NFL. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5210.54s)]
*  ESPN's exposure, they're just, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5213.62s)]
*  the amount of volume there is for it, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5217.88s)]
*  of all of us that were either on it then, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5220.639999999999s)]
*  or the people that are on it now, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5222.5s)]
*  it just leaves these other channels, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5224.179999999999s)]
*  like TNT's like, hey, Bones is up next. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5225.98s)]
*  You haven't seen this one yet. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5229.86s)]
*  Somebody's dead. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5233.58s)]
*  That guy didn't say shit about Tibbs in his minutes. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5234.7s)]
*  Bones, here comes a new charm. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5238.299999999999s)]
*  He's Dustin from Prince. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5240.5s)]
*  Charmed. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5243.259999999999s)]
*  Melissa Milano's back. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5245.42s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I think it's gonna be discussed [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5248.74s)]
*  all the time next season. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5251.66s)]
*  It's gonna be weirdly one of the biggest subplots [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5253.0199999999995s)]
*  of the year, and I think people are gonna be [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5256.139999999999s)]
*  really protective of the show that they really like, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5258.1s)]
*  and how it's gonna fit into this very strange ecosystem. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5261.9400000000005s)]
*  ESPN's weirder than ever. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5265.660000000001s)]
*  And it really is. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5267.54s)]
*  It's the weirdest it's ever been from a talk standpoint. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5268.660000000001s)]
*  One of the last major brand-connected shows. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5273.120000000001s)]
*  When I say, I'm not talking about YouTube shows [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5278.700000000001s)]
*  or other things like that. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5282.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm talking about brand-connected shows. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5283.820000000001s)]
*  The show's connected directly to a major sporting brand, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5285.12s)]
*  a major sporting league that is completely un-PC. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5289.84s)]
*  Doesn't even try. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5295.68s)]
*  Completely un-PC, not PC at all. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5298.04s)]
*  Whatever comes out, we're gonna talk about it. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5302.64s)]
*  They're gonna have, they don't try at all. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5305.54s)]
*  Whereas ESPN has tried very much to walk the line [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5308.28s)]
*  and be in the game of not offending people [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5314.16s)]
*  or even dialing back some of the political rhetoric [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5317.0s)]
*  of the past couple of years to not offend people. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5320.36s)]
*  But when Barkley talks about San Antonio, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5323.639999999999s)]
*  he talks about the big old women in San Antonio. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5326.639999999999s)]
*  He's going back to the jokes. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5331.759999999999s)]
*  And so all of that stuff, whether or not that melds [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5332.88s)]
*  with the culture at ESPN, which is a lot more buttoned up [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5335.82s)]
*  than gets out. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5339.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure there's much culture left anymore. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5340.44s)]
*  Whatever, the absence of culture then. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5342.599999999999s)]
*  So they gotta be able to do their exact same thing. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5344.839999999999s)]
*  And now, if anybody has complaints, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5347.839999999999s)]
*  they're gonna have them with Disney. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5350.44s)]
*  Okay, but we're ignoring a piece of evidence here [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5351.839999999999s)]
*  that tells us that they're gonna leave these guys alone. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5354.16s)]
*  The Bill and myself, ESPN experience, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5357.04s)]
*  again, they're different experiences [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5359.919999999999s)]
*  because of who we were with those companies at the time. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5361.16s)]
*  But the people that we were dealing with, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5363.24s)]
*  what McAfee is allowed to do on that show [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5365.639999999999s)]
*  is the antithesis of what all of the people wanted [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5368.179999999999s)]
*  to be on the air when we worked there, okay? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5371.44s)]
*  So he has freedom of movement with the licensing part of it. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5374.719999999999s)]
*  So that should be the model. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5378.28s)]
*  That should be. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5380.679999999999s)]
*  So basically, if you license it, you turn it over, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5381.5199999999995s)]
*  here's the time slide after the game for an hour, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5383.639999999999s)]
*  we're not touching it. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5385.96s)]
*  I also think like Jimmy and Burke underneath Jimmy [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5387.28s)]
*  are smart guys. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5389.96s)]
*  I do. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5391.28s)]
*  I know we take our, Bill and I enjoy sometimes [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5392.12s)]
*  going down memory lane and getting pissed [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5395.96s)]
*  about all this stuff, but the place at the top [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5397.5s)]
*  feels much more streamlined now. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5399.42s)]
*  And I just can't fathom guys that have really good [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5401.5s)]
*  track records would come in and then go, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5403.9800000000005s)]
*  let's, I'm not guaranteeing like it's going to be [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5406.82s)]
*  word for word, note for note, all the same stuff, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5410.54s)]
*  but I don't know why those, like, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5412.84s)]
*  if you were telling me there were other people in the past [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5414.42s)]
*  that would still be in charge, other people, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5416.5s)]
*  you're like, how the fuck is this guy in charge? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5418.32s)]
*  How is this guy making this decision? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5419.96s)]
*  Oh shit, this guy got replaced six months later [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5421.74s)]
*  and now it's a new Game of Thrones deal. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5423.9800000000005s)]
*  And now this person, because they were in this person's [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5425.78s)]
*  wedding or something else happened here, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5427.58s)]
*  you're like, this person is making decisions? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5430.18s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck is going on here? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5431.26s)]
*  You're like, oh, you have to meet with this person. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5433.34s)]
*  Who's that? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5434.900000000001s)]
*  Your new boss. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5435.74s)]
*  You're like, what? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5436.56s)]
*  I mean, so that doesn't feel like the structure anymore. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5438.06s)]
*  That's a good summary. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5441.74s)]
*  Was I wrong about any of that? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5444.26s)]
*  That was a good summary. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5445.860000000001s)]
*  Now it's, listen, they're outsourcing something [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5447.42s)]
*  in a way that we've only seen them do with McAfee, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5451.360000000001s)]
*  but McAfee's on in the middle of the day. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5454.1s)]
*  Little different. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5456.62s)]
*  It's a little different than the spotlight you have [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5457.72s)]
*  before and after NBA games when you're paying [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5459.84s)]
*  20 million plus for, however, 20 billion, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5462.400000000001s)]
*  whatever it was, man. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5465.68s)]
*  All right. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5469.08s)]
*  It's a TBD, I guess. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5470.400000000001s)]
*  It's a wait and see. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5472.56s)]
*  Ben, what else do you care about? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5473.68s)]
*  Should I lay out and have you guys do college football [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5475.72s)]
*  for 10 minutes? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5477.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, you could. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5479.16s)]
*  College football, because we're heading into the summer. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5480.92s)]
*  And then all of a sudden college football will be starting [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5484.68s)]
*  in like mid August and we'll be like, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5486.58s)]
*  wait, what, the college football started? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5487.82s)]
*  Give us the three things you're most excited about this year. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5489.62s)]
*  Man, these young quarterbacks. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5492.46s)]
*  So you have a couple of guys that are like, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5495.92s)]
*  you have some young guys that are like really [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5497.82s)]
*  on the precipice of stardom. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5500.5s)]
*  DJ Lague of Florida, Lenore Sellers of South Carolina. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5501.86s)]
*  And then you have some guys in new spots, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5505.42s)]
*  John Mateer at Oklahoma, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5507.78s)]
*  that are like really gonna be interesting to watch [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5511.24s)]
*  to see how things go, right? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5514.7s)]
*  Arch Manning, young quarterback who has a small sample size [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5517.78s)]
*  but the entire college football world, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5523.26s)]
*  I would say a large portion of the sports world [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5525.099999999999s)]
*  is gonna be watching to see how Arch Manning plays. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5529.24s)]
*  Obviously you have K Clubnik at Clemson, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5531.78s)]
*  Drew Aller at Penn State. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5535.12s)]
*  What about Hessmeyer? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5536.82s)]
*  Garrett Nussmeyer at LSU. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5538.22s)]
*  LSU has a completely reformed roster. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5540.0199999999995s)]
*  And so all of these guys that are in these different spots, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5545.5s)]
*  first getting their chance, also at Alabama. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5551.22s)]
*  Is Alabama running out? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5554.099999999999s)]
*  What's going on at Alabama? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5556.58s)]
*  I haven't, are they running out the five star [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5557.66s)]
*  that they had that was behind? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5560.38s)]
*  Can't remember the kid's name now. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5563.0199999999995s)]
*  I was watching Pacers Thunder from March this morning. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5565.42s)]
*  So this isn't. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5568.42s)]
*  We weren't really doing that, were you? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5569.66s)]
*  Yeah, Ty Simpson. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5573.86s)]
*  I have the assignments that if you want, but. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5575.94s)]
*  Pacers Thunder, was it a good game? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5579.42s)]
*  No, they smoked him. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5582.16s)]
*  I don't know if you guys want this, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5583.5s)]
*  but the Pacers were 35 and 28 on March 10th. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5584.7s)]
*  Now granted, we know that Nemhart missed time, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5587.86s)]
*  Neesmith missed two months. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5590.0599999999995s)]
*  As you mentioned at the beginning, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5591.66s)]
*  they started nine and 14, 10 and 15. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5592.82s)]
*  They went 15 and four. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5595.139999999999s)]
*  They had a loss at Milwaukee. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5596.86s)]
*  The one point loss to the Lakers on the tip and by LeBron. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5598.219999999999s)]
*  They had an off day before they lost by 21 at Oklahoma City. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5601.78s)]
*  So they went on this great, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5608.94s)]
*  OKC didn't have Chet defensive assignments. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5610.98s)]
*  Halliburton had Dort on him. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5613.66s)]
*  Neesmith had Wallace on him. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5616.3s)]
*  Hardenstein played Turner, obviously. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5618.42s)]
*  SGA played Neesmith and Jalen Williams played Pascal. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5620.0199999999995s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5624.34s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5625.34s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kind of out of season with all this stuff. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5627.219999999999s)]
*  Van, but I'm bigger picture. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5629.139999999999s)]
*  I'm doing a big Tuesday college football thing. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5630.82s)]
*  Bruce Feldman's coming on this every year, every year. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5632.62s)]
*  Now, a sport I love disgusts me far more than any other sport. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5636.38s)]
*  Like this sport is it rotates. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5640.74s)]
*  You don't ever know what the sport's going to be. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5642.74s)]
*  No, it's just the new thing where we shouldn't have had 12 teams. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5644.82s)]
*  Now we're going to have 16 and the SEC in the Big Ten. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5649.179999999999s)]
*  I don't understand how the Big Ten all of a sudden after two national [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5652.0199999999995s)]
*  championships is like, yeah, we're awesome, too, now, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5654.139999999999s)]
*  because the depth of the conference is not the same as the SEC. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5657.299999999999s)]
*  But that's not really the point because I'm mad at both the SEC [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5659.74s)]
*  and the Big Ten for doing this. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5662.179999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5663.219999999999s)]
*  So you you ransacked everybody else's conferences. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5663.42s)]
*  Now you're pissed about how deep your conferences are. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5667.219999999999s)]
*  And now you want four auto bids a piece. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5670.139999999999s)]
*  So it's 16. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5672.179999999999s)]
*  You guys get eight. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5673.86s)]
*  And then I don't look, I haven't read through all the different proposals, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5674.98s)]
*  but it just sucks that the sport has no like David. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5677.9s)]
*  They need a David Stern who would just go, yeah, actually, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5683.139999999999s)]
*  we're not doing any of those things. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5687.179999999999s)]
*  And I don't mean to sound like a guy who's, you know, at a neighborhood [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5689.74s)]
*  meeting here at an HOA thing, but for the greater good. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5693.219999999999s)]
*  And this sport is not about the greater good. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5696.66s)]
*  And it's fucking gross that Stanford plays wake in an ACC game. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5699.54s)]
*  I mean, you've heard all these rants from me before, but all the latest news [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5702.62s)]
*  cycle stuff with college football, it actually gets in the way of my excited [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5705.38s)]
*  excitement for Nussmeyer dialing it up, taking chances on third and slinger. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5709.46s)]
*  Yeah. Third and 12. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5715.139999999999s)]
*  Fuck it. We'll probably be out here for fourth and seven. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5716.38s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you, I don't pay attention to it anymore. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5720.26s)]
*  There you go. And and the reason why I don't is because. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5725.42s)]
*  The core is this. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5732.0199999999995s)]
*  I want to be able to enjoy enjoy LSU [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5734.34s)]
*  versus Mississippi State on a random Saturday. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5738.099999999999s)]
*  Anybody can enjoy LSU, Alabama. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5741.86s)]
*  Anybody can enjoy LSU, Florida. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5744.74s)]
*  Anybody can enjoy LSU, Texas. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5747.179999999999s)]
*  I want to enjoy LSU State. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5749.9s)]
*  I want to enjoy LSU out of conference like lower FCS teams. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5752.179999999999s)]
*  I want to enjoy college football in its essence. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5757.46s)]
*  And the more you pay attention to everything that's happening [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5761.3s)]
*  in and around the sport, you just can't because it's not the same. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5763.62s)]
*  So you like block it out and compartmentalize it. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5767.26s)]
*  It sounds like I block it out and compartmentalize it. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5769.54s)]
*  I pay attention to programs, players, recruiting and coach movement, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5771.9s)]
*  because the business part of it is such a fucking bummer right now. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5778.0199999999995s)]
*  Every once in a while. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5782.82s)]
*  To Ryan's point, I'll think about the fact [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5785.22s)]
*  that the Pac-12 doesn't exist or that SC [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5788.46s)]
*  has to play Minnesota. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5793.74s)]
*  In conference, and I'll be like, you know, what the fuck are we doing? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5797.26s)]
*  Like beyond even a cultural standpoint from what college football is [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5801.0199999999995s)]
*  and used to be, that doesn't make any sense. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5805.18s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to travel across the country and play somebody [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5808.18s)]
*  and then have Penn State come to the Coliseum and walk in quicksand [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5811.26s)]
*  for the first half of the game because the guys are traveling too far. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5818.26s)]
*  They kick ass and it's it doesn't make any sense. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5822.62s)]
*  Well, you know, can I piggyback on that? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5826.0199999999995s)]
*  Sure. Because having some parent people in my life who have kids [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5829.22s)]
*  who compete in college level and how these conferences have screwed up [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5832.7s)]
*  even beyond football, like even if your kids playing [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5836.9s)]
*  girls soccer or running cross country and it's like, yeah, my kid goes to Berkeley. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5840.259999999999s)]
*  We have a meet at Penn State this weekend. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5844.78s)]
*  It's like, what? How is this college sports? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5846.9s)]
*  The whole point of the conference is we are putting teams near each other [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5850.299999999999s)]
*  so that the kids didn't have to travel that far so that they could continue [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5855.139999999999s)]
*  to do schoolwork and they could play sports, but it wouldn't dominate [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5858.7s)]
*  their entire life. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5861.86s)]
*  We lost that narrative, what? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5862.98s)]
*  20, 25 years ago, once the conferences started getting weird. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5864.7s)]
*  Well, yeah, now it's like now it's insane. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5867.74s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I was watching Carter Bryant, the Arizona kid [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5870.139999999999s)]
*  for the draft last night, and it was the Arizona Oregon game. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5873.0599999999995s)]
*  And I was like, oh, yeah, good old. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5876.38s)]
*  And I even stopped myself like not a good old pack 10 pack 12 game. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5877.98s)]
*  This is a big 10, big 12 game. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5881.86s)]
*  Yeah, this is fucking stupid. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5884.66s)]
*  But this started with the Big East when the Big East [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5886.099999999999s)]
*  started to get a little weird. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5889.34s)]
*  And they see that first time when they started jumping back and forth [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5890.98s)]
*  and were like, well, you could go back to the big eight. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5894.06s)]
*  You could talk about, you know, the big eight part of it was was a disruption. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5896.3s)]
*  But at least all of it still made geographical sense. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5900.700000000001s)]
*  And the Big East, there was a couple of different things that happened. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5903.14s)]
*  They screwed themselves. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5905.54s)]
*  ESPN offered them a really like straightforward deal for their college [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5906.820000000001s)]
*  football TV rights. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5910.22s)]
*  And they pushed back and it was like, well, cool, you morons are like fifth [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5911.860000000001s)]
*  on the priority list. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5915.02s)]
*  It was one of the big forks on the roads of this century for sports. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5916.22s)]
*  And then they got competitive about, oh, you're not going to do this. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5920.02s)]
*  Watch this. And they beef up ACC and the rest of this history. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5922.58s)]
*  It's just also it's kind of like a larger and I don't mean to get too [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5926.42s)]
*  into the weeds on it, but it's a larger conversation about like [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5931.9s)]
*  moving from a society where culture [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5935.54s)]
*  dictated football into a society where money dictates football. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5939.42s)]
*  Right. So when culture dictates football, you have different areas of the country [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5944.5s)]
*  that play football in different ways because of the caliber of player. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5948.66s)]
*  And the style of play that that comes from there. Right. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5952.82s)]
*  You had Pac-12 pretty boy football. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5957.1s)]
*  You had bruising down south SEC [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5959.22s)]
*  football with speed and power, kind of the same thing. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5963.14s)]
*  Grinders playing in the cold weather up there in the Big Ten. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5965.86s)]
*  And these teams would meet each other and it would really be a clash [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5970.54s)]
*  of those different places. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5974.42s)]
*  But there was dictated by like the kind of talent you could get from where you were [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5975.7s)]
*  and the kind of schemes and [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5979.3s)]
*  offensive and defensive identities. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5982.26s)]
*  That's what I miss. And I've already done this too many times. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5984.179999999999s)]
*  But for Bill's, when you threw on a game, you knew [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5986.86s)]
*  what it was supposed to look like. And that to me was fun. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5990.86s)]
*  You know, I don't want to drive. I was almost in Nebraska the other day. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5994.5s)]
*  You know what? It looked like fucking Nebraska. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=5997.94s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6000.78s)]
*  I turned around, but I like Tommy Frazier. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6003.0599999999995s)]
*  The I would add I would add these two wrinkles. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6007.98s)]
*  Oh, they'll never make me this Zara Sports. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6011.58s)]
*  I pushed for the job forever. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6014.26s)]
*  My best chance is probably the Obama administration because he actually [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6015.62s)]
*  listened to the content. He didn't care. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6019.14s)]
*  Thankfully for him, we have a college football playoff. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6021.38s)]
*  And thankfully for him, I don't think people should be. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6024.0599999999995s)]
*  I think if you're out of school, you have to be there for at least two years. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6028.42s)]
*  Should be would be one rule I would make. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6031.099999999999s)]
*  So you can still have the transfers. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6034.099999999999s)]
*  You can still have that stuff. Coaches or players. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6035.46s)]
*  It's two years. If you want transfer, you can do it after two. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6038.98s)]
*  You can keep your eligibility, but you still have to make a two year [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6041.9s)]
*  commitment to whatever school. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6044.459999999999s)]
*  That would be the first thing. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6046.9s)]
*  The second thing would be, let's can we fix the conferences somehow? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6048.0599999999995s)]
*  That's like, I don't know. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6052.139999999999s)]
*  I like like there's who like what you mentioned earlier about [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6053.339999999999s)]
*  if there was a czar or whatever, that'd be the first thing they did. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6057.179999999999s)]
*  It's like, all right, guys, this is this is stupid. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6060.259999999999s)]
*  Let's let's let's start. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6063.9s)]
*  Let's press the reset button and just start this over. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6065.54s)]
*  And maybe the teams in the West Coast should try to play [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6068.139999999999s)]
*  as many of the West Coast teams as possible. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6071.22s)]
*  That's a conversation with Fox and ESPN. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6073.099999999999s)]
*  That's really who you have in a conversation with. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6075.58s)]
*  You're having a conversation with Fox and ESPN or Amazon or Apple [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6077.46s)]
*  or whomever else is making the money go through the roof [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6081.46s)]
*  to align the super conferences and make it worth their while [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6086.26s)]
*  to do it the way that they're doing it right now. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6089.58s)]
*  It's not a conversation. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6091.18s)]
*  So we're heading towards we're just heading toward a 30 team [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6091.78s)]
*  college football league basically that maybe exists outside of NCA. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6094.82s)]
*  Maybe to the giant conferences. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6100.3s)]
*  And that's why they're already doing this stuff to be like, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6102.66s)]
*  and we already get all of these automatic bids. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6104.9s)]
*  And you just go like part of me understands the stronger conference. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6106.7s)]
*  Like some of these schedules, you look at them going, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6110.98s)]
*  you've got to be kidding me. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6112.86s)]
*  Florida. Yeah. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6114.099999999999s)]
*  How do you get through this with three losses and you could be considered [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6115.219999999999s)]
*  a top 10 team in the country? [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6118.900000000001s)]
*  But, you know, all the conference, the conference stuff on the realignment [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6121.7s)]
*  part of it as Indiana fans hate me because I was like, you, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6125.26s)]
*  you didn't play anybody and you also have the 16 teams, the big 10. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6131.22s)]
*  I think they played one of the top seven and they, of course, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6137.38s)]
*  were one of the top seven and then they had to put the pacers [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6140.82s)]
*  for like a month and a half. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6143.34s)]
*  Hey, yeah, it's like that. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6145.1s)]
*  You really need to win them back. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6146.5s)]
*  Maybe who's your watch was again? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6147.9s)]
*  Yeah. Some fever stuff maybe for you. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6150.42s)]
*  Well, I'm an angel. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6152.86s)]
*  Reese guy. So that's what I'm talking about. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6153.78s)]
*  Ryan knows what's up. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6157.179999999999s)]
*  Made a lot of progress. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6158.66s)]
*  There you go. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6160.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6161.219999999999s)]
*  We still working the game out. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6162.42s)]
*  We still get our left hand, right? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6163.78s)]
*  We're going to make them layups. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6165.299999999999s)]
*  But you're better. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6166.5s)]
*  Great rebounder. Great rebounder. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6171.179999999999s)]
*  Mitchell Robinson ask, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6172.98s)]
*  did you guys see that Cooper flag was estimated to make $28 million [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6175.26s)]
*  in NIL last year? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6178.900000000001s)]
*  I never did any of that stuff. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6181.54s)]
*  That's right up there where the videos I don't believe videos anymore, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6182.820000000001s)]
*  and I don't believe in NIL. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6185.46s)]
*  That's a lot for the contracts for podcasts. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6188.02s)]
*  Oh, those are obvious. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6192.66s)]
*  I believe some of those things signed around $125 million deal. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6194.22s)]
*  OK, this seems pointed. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6198.42s)]
*  No, it's just I don't. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6201.5s)]
*  Just people seem to report some number that an agent gave them like, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6203.219999999999s)]
*  all right, I'll put that in the newspaper. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6206.62s)]
*  Sounds good. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6208.179999999999s)]
*  The the $28 million for flag seemed high. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6210.7s)]
*  Right. I mean, I have money like Miami State. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6217.339999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think part of that is just, you know, he wants to be an NBA player. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6222.299999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? So but he could have leverage. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6225.099999999999s)]
*  He could have done the Eli thing. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6226.9s)]
*  I still think that would have been so much fun if he was like, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6228.139999999999s)]
*  yeah. I don't really love Dallas. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6231.0199999999995s)]
*  These are the NIL conversations that I'm having. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6234.66s)]
*  Number one, I'm hearing that there are actually high school kids [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6237.0199999999995s)]
*  that have committed to various schools that are being paid [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6240.86s)]
*  10, $20,000 a month while they're in high school [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6244.78s)]
*  for them to keep their commitment. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6248.98s)]
*  That's bananas. That's bonkers. That's crazy. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6250.74s)]
*  That is because, you know, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6253.38s)]
*  now the commitments are worth even less than they used to be [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6256.099999999999s)]
*  because the money talks even more than your relationship [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6258.82s)]
*  with your position coach or whatever. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6261.179999999999s)]
*  The Cooper flag thing, he was only there one year. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6263.099999999999s)]
*  And so him making 30 million. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6266.54s)]
*  And out of from NIL, is this from his senior year on or one year at Duke? [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6270.139999999999s)]
*  That seems like too much money. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6275.54s)]
*  I know he's got shit to go off, but it was the reported number. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6281.0599999999995s)]
*  A rumor was baked into the number. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6285.38s)]
*  I didn't see the piece. So I 28 seems like a lot. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6287.02s)]
*  Twenty eight times. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6291.22s)]
*  I would have guessed like, so you have part of the TV rights in there. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6292.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know where he's getting it from. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6296.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. But you think like if if if that was kind of money [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6300.580000000001s)]
*  floating around. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6303.580000000001s)]
*  Caitlin, if she had stayed for one more Iowa year, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6305.42s)]
*  I can't even imagine what she would have been worth. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6307.900000000001s)]
*  Yes. Now we're now we're talking because what does she like it? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6309.860000000001s)]
*  Eighty seven thousand dollars or something. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6312.5s)]
*  But the and this is this is the part of the WNBA conversation [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6314.9s)]
*  where I would stick up for. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6319.5s)]
*  Their salary plight is that it's like, well, you make all this money off the court. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6322.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like, OK, but what the fuck? [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6325.82s)]
*  So you're admitting like, hey, we're not going to pay you anything an hour, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6328.179999999999s)]
*  but you're going to make a lot of tips. Right. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6331.58s)]
*  Well, they have less games and they're on the old contract [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6335.5s)]
*  and they have the new contract they're negotiating. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6338.46s)]
*  But the league, like the ratings for the league are like stunning. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6341.299999999999s)]
*  And you could argue like Chalamet was there in the next side [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6345.82s)]
*  and Caitlin Clark was there in the Indiana side. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6348.379999999999s)]
*  It's like, I don't know, not. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6351.74s)]
*  Not not far off from a star power standpoint, she's a massive star. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6354.139999999999s)]
*  I think that she's a bigger star than him. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6358.66s)]
*  I you can make the argument, I don't know. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6360.94s)]
*  Chalamet, he's had some 200 and 250 million dollar debuts. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6363.139999999999s)]
*  Can I say something? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6367.98s)]
*  So he so Dune debuts. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6369.66s)]
*  So he has Dune and he has Willy Wonka. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6372.5s)]
*  You know, I'm in on Chalamet. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6375.34s)]
*  I don't want people to think that I'm not in on Chalamet. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6377.46s)]
*  I'm in on Chalamet. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6379.34s)]
*  Definitely in. Right. Huge star. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6381.9800000000005s)]
*  But I would say that like there is a little bit of wish casting [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6384.54s)]
*  that's going away, that's going on with like how big of a star [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6388.3s)]
*  Timothy Chalamet is right now. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6391.7s)]
*  Doing gigantic, two gigantic movies, but also Dune is like this huge [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6393.46s)]
*  science fiction IP will walk as this huge science fiction IP. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6398.1s)]
*  So, I don't know, he's a gigantic counter. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6402.700000000001s)]
*  Can you be a counter? He's hit the point. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6405.46s)]
*  That is the hardest point to get to, where if he has a movie coming out, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6408.42s)]
*  there's just general awareness that he has a movie coming out. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6412.14s)]
*  And the last person who hit that point was Leo. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6414.740000000001s)]
*  It was like if Leo is making a movie, it's like, oh, Leo's making a movie. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6417.780000000001s)]
*  I'll probably go see that. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6421.9800000000005s)]
*  I think Tarantino is like that as a director. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6423.14s)]
*  I think Fincher has hit that point. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6426.74s)]
*  I think Christopher Nolan has at that point. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6428.9400000000005s)]
*  It's very hard. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6430.74s)]
*  PTA, but at the same time, like his movies haven't. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6432.9400000000005s)]
*  They giant money the way some of these other ones have. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6438.02s)]
*  That's the thing. Like critically artists. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6440.78s)]
*  Yeah. For the artists, for the screenwriters out there. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6443.9800000000005s)]
*  But I think Leo is the last one before Chalamet, where it's like, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6447.9800000000005s)]
*  if you see an ad for a new Chalamet movie, you're like, oh, new Chalamet [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6452.66s)]
*  movie. The question for me is, did did MBJ get there after Sinners? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6456.14s)]
*  Could did or maybe he needs one more after Sinners to get that. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6461.34s)]
*  But I don't know if he's there yet or not. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6464.820000000001s)]
*  But I think Chalamet is. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6466.46s)]
*  I think Kugler is definitely there. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6468.14s)]
*  I think Kugler is definitely there. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6469.9800000000005s)]
*  Kugler is definitely there. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6472.02s)]
*  I think Mike is right there as well. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6473.1s)]
*  Sinners is. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6475.860000000001s)]
*  One of the most successful movie [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6478.42s)]
*  projects, maybe the most successful movie project of this this century to me. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6481.66s)]
*  Just because it's a completely original story. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6489.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, that is like incredibly ambitious, like incredibly ambitious. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6493.26s)]
*  All black cast in the South, like not a four quarter set in the 1930s. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6501.02s)]
*  Horror. Like a horror set in the 1930s. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6507.3s)]
*  All black cast, high budget. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6511.54s)]
*  And it does what it does. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6513.58s)]
*  It's really remarkable, to be honest with you, as a filmmaking [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6515.1s)]
*  experiment, what the movie. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6518.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mental Kugler. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6519.86s)]
*  He can do whatever he wants. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6521.38s)]
*  I told Van when we left the theater, the we saw it the day before. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6522.82s)]
*  The movie came out, right? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6527.86s)]
*  We saw it like that Thursday, four o'clock Thursday. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6529.18s)]
*  Yeah, it was Thursday, four o'clock. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6531.66s)]
*  I told Van two hundred million dollars at least. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6532.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's very private. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6535.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of my good predictions. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6537.66s)]
*  Right. I've had some bad ones, including OKC versus Boston for the finals. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6540.58s)]
*  This one of mine, I stuck with that one all year. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6544.259999999999s)]
*  Bill told me we were walking out of the theater and Bill told me, listen, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6547.179999999999s)]
*  if the black community just shows up like they should for this movie, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6551.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm telling you, the sky is the limit. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6554.74s)]
*  Did not say that. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6556.62s)]
*  He goes, because I can tell you that I felt it. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6557.54s)]
*  I felt it deep in my soul. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6560.9s)]
*  If the black community can just show up for this movie like they should, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6562.46s)]
*  where the sky is the limit. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6566.259999999999s)]
*  We agreed it was going to make a ton of money. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6567.94s)]
*  It's like Todd Chrisley getting out of jail. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6569.86s)]
*  And then is he out? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6571.94s)]
*  He's one of the great civil rights leaders of our times. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6575.099999999999s)]
*  Did you see what he said, Bill? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6578.74s)]
*  What he talked was he gets out of jail and he's in his first. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6580.9s)]
*  And, you know, there's a whole thing Trump pardoned him. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6585.82s)]
*  So he doesn't want to do that. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6588.259999999999s)]
*  He wants to come back out and still be cool. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6590.0199999999995s)]
*  He goes on a whole soliloquy about how bad black men are treated in jail [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6591.46s)]
*  and how great he was treated while he was in prison. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6596.7s)]
*  Todd, please clip that show like Todd. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6599.3s)]
*  Todd was showing up, telling you, man, he goes, I was allowed to watch TV. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6604.38s)]
*  All right. I'm going to wrap up because it's been. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6616.26s)]
*  Are you embarrassed? Well, unless you guys have anything else. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6618.1s)]
*  Ben, you get we have seven minutes left in the pot. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6621.62s)]
*  If you have one more topic, give it to us. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6624.9400000000005s)]
*  No, that's it. I'm you're tapped out. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6627.22s)]
*  I want to go to the gym. Let's be done. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6630.22s)]
*  We're still let's go to the gym. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6632.06s)]
*  We don't need to preview the OKC Indiana Series. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6634.9800000000005s)]
*  OKC is a minus seven fifty favorite and we can do that on our next. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6637.42s)]
*  I'm going to preview a Tuesday. I'm going to watch the March game again. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6641.7s)]
*  I like what you did. I like what you did. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6646.820000000001s)]
*  You're so happy about the patients. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6648.38s)]
*  You didn't want to talk about the finals. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6649.780000000001s)]
*  Minus seven fifty is a massive line for the finals, and I don't [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6653.54s)]
*  going back to you'd have to go back to Lakers nets, I think, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6657.7s)]
*  to see probably a more one sided matchup. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6661.42s)]
*  I second Lakers Nets one where she's like, I can't even try to make a case here. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6664.54s)]
*  I'm going to ask one question before we go. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6669.3s)]
*  From a franchise standpoint. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6672.7s)]
*  What kind of trouble would OKC be in if they lost the finals here? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6675.22s)]
*  It seems like there's not a ton of pressure on them. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6680.900000000001s)]
*  Obviously, it's their first time getting there. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6684.58s)]
*  They've built pretty progressively over the last [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6686.38s)]
*  couple of years to get here and have this. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6691.14s)]
*  But they are such a well put together team, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6693.26s)]
*  such a dominant team in so many different ways. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6696.86s)]
*  And a lot of young players, a lot of flexibility right now [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6700.5s)]
*  with what they're paying people on the roster. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6705.14s)]
*  But if they don't win now, if they don't win, you could argue that they need to win [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6706.82s)]
*  this finals to start the run that people think they're going to have. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6712.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're that worried about it. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6716.38s)]
*  But I think what's at stake for them is almost like something bigger than the title. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6720.54s)]
*  Like if they swept Indiana. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6724.54s)]
*  And they finish, they'd be 84 and 18, I think, Rossella. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6727.1s)]
*  And that just puts them in one of the all time great seasons anyone's ever had. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6730.9400000000005s)]
*  They would always have to be mentioned, which is slightly different stakes. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6735.22s)]
*  Right. I do think Indiana will try to muck it up against them, make it chaotic [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6738.22s)]
*  and try to do what they did with the with the with the next and just push the pace, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6742.86s)]
*  play with as much pace as possible and just try to make it attract me. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6748.66s)]
*  But man, it's the opposite of mucking it up. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6752.74s)]
*  Well, mucking it up and just making it chaotic and weird the whole time. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6756.0599999999995s)]
*  You're right. Mucking it up is wrong. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6760.139999999999s)]
*  Making it chaotic. Whatever that verb is. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6762.139999999999s)]
*  I had an idea in my head of what mucking. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6764.38s)]
*  So what just chaotic ending it up. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6767.259999999999s)]
*  Is that a verb? Yeah, I understand. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6770.58s)]
*  I'm being a little unfair here. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6773.179999999999s)]
*  They just want to they have to do this and make OKC try to play with them. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6774.7s)]
*  And that's Indiana's superpower, at least so far. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6778.5s)]
*  Play our pace. You're going to do what we want to do. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6782.38s)]
*  Do this with us. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6785.099999999999s)]
*  And then they rope you into it. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6786.38s)]
*  You know, like, this is fun. I love doing this. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6787.82s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're down game one. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6790.0599999999995s)]
*  But I don't think that's going to work. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6792.34s)]
*  This so to put it in perspective, minus seven fifty, it was minus three [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6794.66s)]
*  seventy five against Minnesota. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6798.38s)]
*  And I was like, man, that's that's pretty aggressive there. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6799.58s)]
*  Because I thought Minnesota would be more competitive in that series. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6801.74s)]
*  They were not ready to win the series. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6803.74s)]
*  This is I'm looking at it right now. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6807.9s)]
*  You would remember this better than I would, Bill. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6811.22s)]
*  But were the Lakers minus 2000 against the Sixers in 2001? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6812.94s)]
*  It was unbettable, but I don't remember what the exact into that. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6818.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't remember the exact one, because then the Sixers won game one [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6822.3s)]
*  and OT and it was like, oh, yeah. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6825.86s)]
*  Team team versus me. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6829.3s)]
*  No, I think if you're looking at. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6831.78s)]
*  If you're looking at OKC beds, so them to sweep the series. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6834.38s)]
*  Is plus three thirty and then to win in five is plus two twenty. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6839.14s)]
*  They're down to minus seven hundred on Fandel now, but I think. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6843.98s)]
*  House is like already on record as like he's betting the sweep [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6848.0199999999995s)]
*  and he thinks Indiana will not win a game. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6850.86s)]
*  That price is great and go against it in game three, all that stuff. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6853.74s)]
*  I think Indiana could win a game, though. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6859.34s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of a [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6861.58s)]
*  little bit of a big difference in the game, but I think it's a little bit [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6863.58s)]
*  of a big difference in the game. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6866.78s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of a big difference in the game. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6868.0599999999995s)]
*  But, you know, like, like, OKC got killed by Minnesota in game three. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6870.0199999999995s)]
*  Like they think young teams, especially in the road, I think they bet [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6875.22s)]
*  they were a little different home versus road. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6879.94s)]
*  I think Indiana could catch them in one of those games, but we'll see. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6882.22s)]
*  All right, Rossello, sad, everyone at the gym van. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zHiCEhK7K8&t=6885.3s)]
