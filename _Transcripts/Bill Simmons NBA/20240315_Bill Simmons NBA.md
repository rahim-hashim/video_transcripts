# The Worst NBA Contracts Draft With Joe House and Big Wos | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEzwezyKrE)
*  All right.
*  We're doing it again.
*  Third annual worst NBA contracts draft.
*  I think two years ago we tried to be nice and call it the regrettable
*  contracts, but we're not going to be nice.
*  What do we care?
*  We're just these let's call it what it is.
*  These are the worst.
*  This is our crew.
*  Big Was is back.
*  Joe house is here.
*  Nobody has more experience with bad NBA contracts than Joe house.
*  You've lived it.
*  How many years?
*  35 years of your life, bad contracts.
*  Every single year, it seems like we might be out from under it.
*  And then there's a new brand new arrival, a new candidate, a new
*  signing, and it just keeps on coming.
*  It's it's in perpetuity here in the nation's capital.
*  By the way, Bill, these contracts are signed generations of these guys.
*  Families will be able to enjoy this money.
*  I think it's okay if we call them bad contracts because these guys are overpaid.
*  I think it's okay.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's an important thing to say at the top.
*  We are not talking about these people as people.
*  Yeah.
*  We are only talking about them as assets on an NBA team and what they're worth and
*  whether a franchise decided they were worth more than they're paying the person.
*  And that's where we are right now, where we have guys that might be worth 10 million.
*  And for some reason they're getting 30 a year.
*  They're guys that maybe should have a $40 million four year deal.
*  And for some reason it's 120 and we're going to point out all those.
*  What we do, we do a draft.
*  Uh, was has gone first the last two years in a row house always passes up the sandwich
*  pick, even though he loves sandwiches.
*  So you're going to go second, but I'm going to go third and then have the first pick
*  back.
*  Um, so we do snake fashion.
*  Do you guys remember who the first picks were in 2022 and 2023?
*  I mean, I think it was, yeah, let's see.
*  Well, I would assume it was either Bradley bill or Ben Simmons.
*  No, you went off the board quickly.
*  You blew houses.
*  Mine.
*  You took Davos Bertons.
*  You did it.
*  Number one pair.
*  I have serious house.
*  I thought he was getting them and, uh, every time I think you were going Westbrook last
*  year, here was, here was what the order was.
*  Ben Simmons went first.
*  Okay.
*  Bradley Beale second.
*  Duncan Robinson was our third pick.
*  And that's the thing about the worst contracts draft.
*  Sometimes it lights a little flame under somebody.
*  Sometimes they play themselves out of the draft.
*  Duncan Robinson, a valuable guy for Miami this year.
*  So kudos to him.
*  That was so bad, Bill, that they pulled his podcast from, they said you can't even
*  podcast anymore.
*  You're playing so bad.
*  Well, he's back.
*  Bertons was fourth and then Rudy go bear was our fifth pick.
*  Another guy who's not going to be drafted probably today.
*  Uh, towns Collins, young Jordan pool was ninth and Evan Fournier was our 10th pick.
*  So a couple of things for the listeners.
*  If somebody's on an expiring contract makes them less valuable, that doesn't mean
*  was isn't going to take clay Thompson at some point, even though he's got three
*  months left on his deal.
*  He still might take them, but, uh, that expiring deal makes them a little less,
*  uh, a little less gamey for us.
*  And then the other thing I just want to mention the top house, less bad contracts,
*  like less long, bad ones than we used to have.
*  And it just, I think, cause the terms are shorter, the athletes are more willing to
*  bet on themselves.
*  Like, didn't you notice there's just less?
*  Yeah, I felt like, you know, one of the wrinkles that we're going to try and
*  incorporate, there'll be some speculation coming into the upcoming free agencies.
*  And as I look down the list of guys that are going to be free agents, it's like,
*  you know what?
*  I don't really see any of these guys as candidates for gross overpays.
*  And we accept LeBron James.
*  Well, that's a matter of debate.
*  42 year old LeBron James make it $60 billion a year.
*  Maybe it won't be a gross overpay was I don't know.
*  Do you think LeBron comes up in this draft?
*  I mean, just so the listeners know, we have added an addendum in the sense of
*  anticipating guys who are going to get deals that end up looking ridiculous this upcoming summer,
*  which is only, man, that's only like four months from now.
*  Right?
*  So four months from now, there's some guys that are in line for some pretty cool raises for them
*  and their families that might look nasty the second after the ink dries when that.
*  Well, we can only guess, but we can guess that Pascal Siakam is going to get a max or close to a max.
*  Yeah, we can guess that OGN and OB is going to get a max or close to a max.
*  We can guess that LeBron is getting at least a hundred million for the next two years combined.
*  Probably.
*  Probably.
*  Yeah, he's angling for a third year.
*  We'll see if he gets it.
*  You know, that Las Vegas franchise isn't going to pay for itself, so he's definitely angling for a
*  third year. But yeah, LeBron is in line. Yeah, you already said Siakam.
*  Those are the big ones.
*  Harden's going to get paid.
*  Oh, shit. I forgot about Harden. Yeah, Balmer's definitely paying him.
*  He's going to get paid.
*  All right, so James Harden's extension is on the board, if anyone wants to say that.
*  Wow.
*  Let's go.
*  Where's Contracts Draft? Let's do it. Was, lead us off. Who do you have?
*  So this one, it was definitely a little bit of, I had to fight with myself about what the pick
*  would be because there are guys who have more money left on their deal, but are quality,
*  you could say, players at their position. And so while they're a bit underwater, they're
*  a bit underwater on the contract, meaning they're probably getting paid 10, 15 million
*  more than they should. And they're going to have that over the course of the next two to three
*  seasons. How's this already laughing? Excited? But then there are guys who are complete zeros
*  when they don't play. And when they do, they're negative. And that's why my first pick is Ben
*  Simmons, who's owed 40 million dollars.
*  That's a relief. Oh, I was so worried.
*  Next year. Next year, Ben Simmons is going to get 40 million. And the reason why I didn't pick him
*  over guys like Levine or Beal or some of these other guys who are going to quickly come off the
*  board, the Nets are trying to be good right now.
*  Yeah, because they don't have their pick. They actually needed Ben Simmons.
*  And they're paying him 40 million this year and 40 million next to not play. And when he does play,
*  he's effectively a backup center, guys. They're paying a backup center 40 million dollars next year.
*  Seventy eight million this year and next year. He was the second pick in last year's draft house.
*  So last year, we did a whole thing about bad contract or sad contract.
*  Right.
*  That's a nice angle.
*  Lonzo Ball for more of you.
*  Lonzo Ball, bad contract, but also like a sad contract. Like it's not his fault.
*  How is Ben Simmons a bad contract or a sad contract for you?
*  It's both. And honestly, it's wonderful that we are doing this draft on the same day that it's
*  reported that Ben Simmons had his surgery on his back for the second time in three years. The news
*  came out today. Ben Simmons has played in 57 games since the Nets acquired him during the 2021,
*  go back further. He's played in 57 games since the Hawks series in 2021.
*  Sure. Fine.
*  Which was three years ago.
*  And he missed games due to his mental health issue, apparently, which is a funny way of saying,
*  I don't want to play basketball unless you trade me. And he's missed games because he
*  allegedly hurt himself trying to get himself into shape for the season. Whenever it was that he
*  decided to return to professional basketball, this is a dude who just doesn't want to play.
*  He's changed agencies.
*  He doesn't want to play basketball. He could take that $40 million that he's going to get next year.
*  The last time he will ever get anything like that in terms of money and go back to Australia,
*  I don't know how they feel about him there. Could he join? Could he be like a, you know,
*  get on the national team in Australia, play for them? Is that a path to rehabilitation?
*  He can't play in the NBA. He doesn't want to play in the NBA. And so honestly, we're going to be
*  bidding him a Bon Voyage, I believe. This is the end of the line for Ben Simmons because his deal
*  will be finally, mercifully for the Brooklyn Nets expiring next year. And the Simmons thing
*  is so crazy because it took another bizarre turn last week or maybe a week and a half ago
*  when his agent came out and said, guys, it's my fault Ben Simmons isn't playing.
*  I didn't do the due diligence of finding the right doctors and getting second and third opinions.
*  And like, I've never, I've never heard of this in my life. A guy's agent came out and is taking
*  the bullets because Ben Simmons treatment wasn't taken seriously enough.
*  Well, I figured Ben was going to be one of our top two picks and actually did some,
*  did some research trying to figure out was there an exact moment that this went sideways? Because
*  Doc had said on one of my pods, he was like that Atlanta series when they started fouling him
*  and I saw it in his eyes and he was never the same after they did that. So I actually went back and
*  I was like, is that true? In the 2021 Washington series house, if you remember Russell Westbrook,
*  my guy pulled your D, you leave one of Russ's last fans. So you're, you're down three, nothing in
*  game four in Washington and they start doing hack a Ben trying to get back in the game.
*  They end up, they're up to with like, you can go watch on YouTube. They're up to with like
*  two plus minutes left and they intentionally foul Ben Simmons after he gets a rebound.
*  I think he makes one misses the other, but so now the seeds planted.
*  He averaged in that Washington series in five games, 15, 10 and nine, he almost averaged a
*  triple double. You go to the Atlanta series that drops to six, seven and nine. And the key game
*  was that game five that doc mentioned. Philly's up, they're up 51 31 in the first half. They're up
*  like 26 in the second half and Atlanta comes back and wins. But one of the things that happens second
*  quarter Philly's up 20, Atlanta starts fouling Ben Simmons and he misses seven of his next eight
*  free throws. And he's never the same. So it's like, I I'm sure physically there's some issues.
*  I think stress has some, some stuff to do with back issues, which I personally experienced,
*  but he finished that last three games of the Atlanta series, six, seven and nine,
*  seven for 20 from free throws. And then for the rest of his career, since he's made zero threes
*  31 for 72 from the charity straight. So his last 92 free throws he's made 38 was 38 for 92
*  making, you know, high thirties to me, this, there might be stuff going on with them physically,
*  but to me, this is like, this is a meant, this is like Chuck Knobloch. We're going in that
*  direction with this is somebody that got the yips. Yeah. This is somebody that something happened to
*  them and they couldn't get it back. But maybe he didn't want to put in the work. Maybe physically
*  he wasn't feeling the same, but, um, this is like a sports documentary at this point house.
*  Well, and, and I think this could be the end, like the last, the final chapter is this upcoming
*  season. Who knows whether or not he's able to rehabilitate himself after this back surgery
*  and, and show up. I mean, the nets are saying, or we expect them back for a full season, you know,
*  best of luck. And it is very curious to me, the observation made at the outset, as we were talking
*  about this pick the Brooklyn nets are trying to win right now. Is that really what we're going to pull in?
*  Yeah. They need like a rebounder defender. They don't own their pick futures. Like they have picks out,
*  they have a bunch of swaps out. They don't own their destiny as far as picks are concerned.
*  And so they want to put as quality, high quality of roster out there as possible
*  at all times. And there is $40 million burning a hole through their books. It's just a cautionary
*  tale. This is why they dumped their whole front office. Cause when you get this bent, oh no,
*  they'll wait. He's got some, he's got some, he's got some compromise on Joe side that we haven't
*  heard about, man. Well, we, we like Ben Simmons as an asset when he was holding out with Philly,
*  even though there was buzz that he was in London, that he wasn't even working on his game, that he
*  didn't really care about playing basketball. And I was still like, that's still an asset. Like if I'm,
*  if I'm another team looking to cash in on somebody, I would still think about that. Even last year
*  with Portland, with Dame, I was like, you know, and if I'm Portland and it's just two years of
*  Ben Simmons roll the dice, the world, the dice era with Ben Simmons is now over. And that's it.
*  You're right. He might be an Australian two years. All right, House, you have the second pick. Who do
*  you got? I'm so happy. This was so nice of Was the lead in that he, he teed up is so perfect for this
*  player. This guy, I literally have never seen a player with this much talent who is so disconnected
*  to the, the, the, the, any of the elements of winning basketball. And of course I'm talking
*  about Jordan pool. He is literally the dumbest basketball player in terms of the talent that he
*  possesses I've ever seen ever in my entire life of as a fan of professional basketball, our good buddy,
*  Tom Haberstro. I feel like he did this for me in the middle of February, did a breakdown. So Jordan
*  pools in the first year of his four year, $126 million contract that gold. We should, we should
*  have mentioned that sooner. Four years, 126 million. And this is year one, three years, 100 million
*  basically left on the deal after this year. Oof. So this is a guy who has the most turnovers
*  without an assist in clutch time for any guard going all the way back to 1996, 97. Wait, he
*  doesn't have an assist in crunch time? No clutch time assist. Zero. No assist? How is that possible?
*  Well, somewhere along the way here. He's the point guard. Well, the team, the teams, you know,
*  finally decided to bring him off the bench. He leads all players in the NBA with the most fouls
*  beyond the three point arc. The worst kind of foul that you can commit. Jordan pool leads all
*  players in that he is number one amongst all guards at the NBA in travels. He has the worst
*  shooting percentage among all players with at least 150 attempts on pull up three pointers. Take
*  a guess at what his shooting percentage is for, for, for, for dribble up, pull up three pointers.
*  He's underwater. He's definitely under 30. I would say like 28%. 27.3 as of, you know,
*  it feels worse when you're watching them on a small TV in your house. And I honestly don't
*  know what the path out of this is. I can't, I can't come up with it's a true conundrum. It's a,
*  it's a challenge that I'm not up for. How does he get better? What fixes him? I honestly,
*  a couple of my wife's friends, I not even close friends, but extended friends, like microdosing
*  is in now. I wonder, maybe they should just try microdosing with them. It seems like it calms
*  moods. It mellows people out. Like maybe we're at the microdosing level with Jordan pool.
*  So brain chemistry, we want to alter his brain chemistry. Maybe it'll have him have an assist
*  in the last three minutes. I was looking at the stats about just like these are more simple than
*  the stats you came up with, but he's for anyone who's played over 25 minutes a game, he's 173rd
*  out of 179 players in net rating. He's minus 11. He's shooting 32% from three, but he's taking
*  6.8 three pointers a game. And in the last two years, only two players have averaged seven
*  three pointers a game, but shot under 33% Jordan pool. And can you guess who the other one is?
*  So seven threes a game under 33%. Russell Westbrook. No, good guess. It's, it's Jalen Green.
*  Oh, wow. Of course it is. That's probably going to be in the wizards in two years. Like don't
*  rule it out. The conundrum here for me is just how good he was in the last couple of finals games.
*  So now worst case scenario, he looked like Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford. Yeah. You know, that,
*  that was going to be his destiny. Like instant offense off the bench, good three point shooter,
*  a lot of confidence, really smart decision making. He looked curry light a little bit.
*  And I mean that as a positive that he could do like a curry impression for them.
*  And from the moment he got punched by Draymond, it went away and we haven't seen it since.
*  And I don't know what happened in the best of times. Jordan pool was a negative on defense,
*  literally one of the worst high minutes guards in the league by every single metric. I test,
*  you name it, teammate, I rolls, whatever metric you want to use. He was leading the league and
*  being horrible at defense, at guard, and he's supposed to be an all offensive player.
*  And yeah, I think he's at above a 25% usage on the season or about there, which is damn high,
*  right? Like that's like running the offense type of thing. And he's got a true shooting
*  percentage at about 51. He might even be huffering around the fifties by the time of this recording.
*  And so negative on defense and now high minutes, high usage, not neutral, not like kind of decent.
*  He's horrible on offense. Now, do you have stats on eye rolls? Did second spectrum keep track of
*  that? How many times somebody like podcast every now and again and hear him defend the punch house?
*  Can you yeah, wait, Draymond. That was a lose lose literally forever and involved. There were
*  no winners whatsoever. House. What's it like to watch him week to week when a player who clearly
*  cannot get out of a funk to the point that it's almost like watching. We've seen this happen in
*  other sports, right? This happens in baseball where like the closer just can't throw a strike
*  anymore. We've seen it in football where the quarterback, it happened to Mac Jones this year.
*  Like he just literally lost his confidence and became unplayable for a team that needed a
*  quarterback. What's it like to watch an NBA player go through this? The problem I have is I'm not sure
*  it's a funk. I think this is who he is. And you know, I don't think he belongs in the NBA,
*  to be honest with you. Well, this is the challenge, right? If you, if you what is the thing that he
*  does that helps the team with winning? What, what? But we've seen him do it though. So the thing is,
*  we've seen it surrounded by three hall of famers. He was surrounded by three hall of famers with,
*  with discrete minutes. I do wonder if somewhere early on, if you wanted to be a person that
*  subscribed to the golden state, uh, you know, light years ahead, the thesis that they dubs culture,
*  that they overpaid him, that they understood how limited he ultimately was going to be.
*  And they zag, they said, you know what, what if we gave him this enormous contract to make the
*  rest of the league think that there is some value associated with this dude, because he is a sunk
*  cost. He's absolutely a sunk cost, uh, in terms of actual winning basketball. I know that they
*  really thought he had a chance to be like a special piece of a bunch of good teams over the course of
*  the decade. I don't, I don't think they know what happened, but I will say this, I, I'm still rooting
*  for him and I always feel bad for him. And I thought he got a really raw deal with that, with
*  the Draymond incident. And he did, and he did handle it with a lot of grace. Anytime he's talked
*  about it in public, he's been really freaking gracious and could have been a lot more pissed
*  off about it publicly throwing people under the bus and stuff like that. He's been really
*  gracious. Maybe that's what he should do. Maybe he, maybe he needs to, that's how he gets his mojo
*  back is he should love some grenades. All right, we're going to take a break.
*  I can't believe the second guy on my board is still available and I'm going to take him right
*  after this. All right, coming back, I have the third and fourth picks in the worst contracts draft
*  and I'm going to take somebody who was number two on my board ahead of Ben Simmons.
*  Zach Levine, four years, including this year left $198 million plus has a 15% trade kicker.
*  If he gets traded right now, he is the seventh biggest contract value in the entire league,
*  which would go up with the trade kicker. He's hurt. He's had at least one knee surgery. Did
*  he have two knee surgeries or one? I can't remember. He had at least one torn ACL, but now
*  he's got this foot thing. He was available for a month and nobody wanted to trade for him except
*  LeBron, which by the way is a fact. How much we trust. So here's what really strikes me fellas
*  with Zach and this is like, cause somebody's going to try to talk themselves into him this summer
*  for $198 million minus whatever it was this year. He is, this was his 10th year in the,
*  in the league. Do you guys realize that? That he was in the 2015 draft.
*  Was how many playoff games do you think he's played in?
*  Total number of playoff games. What would your guess be? Well, I guess he was,
*  this is year 10 of Zach. He was, he was part of the Jimmy Butler deal. They got Jimmy to Minnesota.
*  Yeah. So he wasn't on that Minnesota team. The Bulls only made the play in.
*  So he's never made the playoffs. He's just going to talk it out.
*  Zero playoffs. Zero playoffs. No, it's four playoff games. I was going to say five. I was
*  going to say five. All right. So I had to look this up and you basketball reference,
*  I'm a subscriber to StatHead cause I like looking up weird shit. How many guys have played
*  the first 10 years of their career and played less than five playoff games? Well,
*  you could get answers for that. How many of those guys also made an all-star team and played less
*  than five playoff games and played 10 years in the league? It's him and Maurice Stokes.
*  Those are the only two. Maurice Stokes, which is one of the saddest NBA stories ever, because he
*  had like an annual, this guy was basically Elgin Baylor before Elgin Baylor got hurt and they had
*  the Maurice Stokes award and it's, you know, he's a beloved NBA figure. He's the only other
*  one in the history of the league that this happened to. If you expand it to five playoff games or less,
*  the great Steve Francis enters the equation as the third guy. House, this is pretty dire.
*  And this is a guy that you've looked at for the Wizards for the last four or five years as like
*  30% kind of wanted him and 70% nude and badly. Definitely not interested. Definitely not. No,
*  I mean, he's, this is a guy who's going to, this contract's going to run its course and there will
*  be a reset of, you know, what, what he can get in the marketplace. And he'll be 34 at that point. 33.
*  Is it going to be half of what he's getting right now? Is it going to be, is it, is it 20,
*  25 million, right? This is the last one. Yeah. Have we now with the, after the Bradley Beale deal,
*  where it's like, Oh, you gotta give them that you got to protect the asset. You can't lose the
*  asset. And a year later they have Jordan pool for the Bradley and a bunch of, they have 40
*  second round picks in Jordan pool because they protected the asset. Same for the same for the
*  bulls. The bulls are, I got to protect the asset. Can't let Zach Levine leave. Well, now you're stuck
*  with Zach Levine. Is this era now over? Are we going to see a team just be like, you know what?
*  Fuck that. I don't even want to protect the asset. Good luck. Godspeed. Yeah. I think because of the
*  structure of the salary cap teams often just get capped into doing it. Meaning there's no way to
*  even get replacement level talent in the building. You just, you're just literally fielding a way
*  worse team at that point. But at the same time, man, I wondered what the bulls specifically,
*  what they might do when faced with this, because if people remember Zach Levine was in the press
*  complaining because he thought the bulls might not play him, I'll pay him. Right. And I remember
*  Wind Horse had put something out and Chicago had been putting out for a while. Like, look,
*  why would we pay a guy who can't get us in the playoffs? Yeah. He's never done it. And then,
*  what are we the wizards? And then ultimately they did it. They pulled the trigger on it.
*  And yeah, it's been quite regretful. The fact that so many teams want to add, you know, the idea of
*  what Zach Levine brings to the table. He just languished there and nobody pulled the trigger.
*  And then also that first, so you guys remember him and Billy Donovan got into it. Yeah. So there was
*  all this stuff in the press, him and Billy Donovan hating each other. And let me tell you, it wasn't
*  just Billy Donovan, the guys on the team, that first time he left the team and they took off,
*  the guys on the team were sick of Zach Levine. So it's like coaches, players, like everybody's
*  off of this guy. And then teams around the league were like, I'm good. Even Rob
*  Palenka was disciplined enough not to do something like this. That's crazy.
*  Yeah. So Levine gets hurt this year, Kobe White gets more minutes and the Bulls immediately look
*  way better. And you know, or at least a frisky playing team. How's anything to add about Zach
*  Levine before I go to my fourth pick? No, I mean, we said it all. Good luck to him for the
*  rest of his career. It might not be very long. Top three for Zach Levine, tough B for him.
*  All right. Well, I also have the fourth pick. I feel semi bad doing this, but then I thought about
*  how I lost my 2022 title, banner 18 for the Celtics because really Steph Curry in game four
*  and Jordan Poole coming off the bench in the last three games. But really it was Andrew Wiggins
*  turning into the second best player of the series and becoming this amazing two way guy,
*  tapping and all the potentially had leading to him getting a pretty nice extension. Four years,
*  109 million last year. He disappeared for a long time. Don't want to speculate on whatever.
*  We've all been like, I don't know what happened, but feel bad for him. I have an idea and it wasn't
*  warranted. And this year he did it again and was just gone for two weeks. So this is two years
*  a row where he just left the team. But I'm just going to do production. He's down to 12.6 points
*  a game and four rebounds. And his three point shooting is in the 35% range. And the reason
*  this is the number four pick for me is I think he's almost impossible to trade. Who is, who is like,
*  Oh cool. I can get Andrew Wiggins. I just, at this point he's going to hit his thirties.
*  There's been some erratic stuff the last couple of years. People aren't sure about the motor to
*  begin with. And if he leaves that golden state infrastructure, what am I getting?
*  And I just think I was looking at everybody else on my list and I, I would, he would give me the
*  most hesitation house. It's like, Oh, Andrew Wiggins for that. I don't know. The problem with him is
*  what evidence is there setting aside the title runs six months in 2022. We'll always have those
*  six months. That's right. That he wants six months that he wants to play NBA basketball.
*  That he likes playing. That's it. Yeah. It was like the six months before Kyle's wedding,
*  when he like wasn't smoking, he wasn't going out the same thing. He, Andrew Wiggins,
*  like, look at this guy. He's changed his life. He's an adult now. Kyle is all grown up. He's
*  throwing a wedding for himself. Um, yeah, I don't know. Why is it where, where's Wiggins a year
*  from now? What team still going to great court that I mean, he's not so bad. I feel like yet
*  that he can't even be salary dumped. But when he signed that deal, everybody was like, man,
*  he should have held out for more. Everybody thought it was a steal for what he got. And
*  what we all forgot is that Glenn Taylor gave him a max rookie extension on a freaking promise
*  that he would try hard. That was a thing Glenn Taylor said in public. He said, I talked to
*  Andrew and he told me he's going to work himself into being worthy of the contract. I just
*  fashioned on it. That's a thing that happened. Such an underrated, awful owner, Glenn Taylor.
*  Yeah. It was just a disaster. He's so low profile. He did some of the dumbest shit ever.
*  Cause you know why, Bill? Cause a lot of times bad owners are associated with meddling.
*  With Glenn Taylor is the opposite. It's apathy. Yeah. And like, Hey, this David
*  Kahn seems like a good guy. You know, the one thing I'll say with Wiggins house is that by all
*  accounts, like really well liked teammate. Okay. You could feel it in the 2022 playoffs when he was
*  doing well. They were all the warriors and Steve Kerr and the coaching staff, they're all, they
*  called them wigs. Yeah. So happy that he was having a moment, right. Which makes me think like,
*  could this come back? But I just, for that price, I don't know who's taken like when Dallas didn't
*  want to take a gamble on it and went for PJ Washington instead, right. They could have just
*  probably flip grant Williams and a pick and a Wiggins if they wanted, or even just grant
*  Williams and something. But I just don't feel like anyone was, was looking at Wiggins.
*  House you're up number five.
*  Well, I can't let a top five of, of worst contracts in the NBA go by without including Bradley Beale.
*  I mean, he's 30 years old. He's in the second year of his five year, $251 million deal.
*  The final season of that contracts is a player option for 57.1 million.
*  He just said, he just said, yes, I'm going to exercise that.
*  Can we bet on that future? Is that a future we can get vandal to write some odds for us?
*  By the way, that's the second biggest contract value in the entire league right now.
*  Well, contract, yes value. No, he's played 36 out of 65 games. And you know, when you,
*  when you look up his stat line and says Bradley Beale nursing hamstring is what it says he's,
*  he's averaging 18 point, 18.6 points per game. Now look, this, the stat line for him this season
*  in the 36 out of 65 games that he's played to date, not bad. He's shooting almost 50% from the field,
*  just 49.7 and he's up on his career average from three 37.7%.
*  I gotta say, I like the way he's been playing for them. He just wants to know his play.
*  He's playing well.
*  If he was playing, but yeah, I think he's fit in really nicely with them.
*  Me too. Good, good asset when, when he plays.
*  But he's being paid as if he's shade Gilded Alexander.
*  Yeah.
*  But he's a glorified third banana. I mean, come on. It's a terrible contract.
*  And then you forgot the last part, um, house, which is my favorite part about the Bradley
*  Beale contract. He has a no trade. So even that move with him, did it go from the
*  I think you get to bring it. Yeah. It's like BD. You just get to bring it to the next stop.
*  Even if you find a place that's crazy enough, sicko enough, you know, to love Brad Beale so
*  much as to try to trade for him and give you value for the guy, uh, he could veto the deal.
*  It's, it's, it's the gift that keeps on giving the Brad Beale contract.
*  One of my favorite Bradley Beale stats is he hasn't played 60 games in a season since the 2018,
*  19 campaign when Kawhi was on Toronto and Kevin Durant was on the warriors.
*  It was five fucking years ago. He's played 60 games.
*  I do like the way he fits with Booker and Durant though. Hey, house and I talked, uh,
*  and I know house did a thing on the East coast bias. As always, like you guys stole
*  stuff that I brought up in the thread. At least you gave me credit this time.
*  I did. What are you talking about?
*  It's fine. Um, but I was saying that Phoenix, the more I stare at the West and the more I stare at
*  Denver and how unbeatable they are, especially in the last five minutes, just nobody's beating them.
*  So unless you, if you, you have to be up 10 on them with five minutes left and that's how you beat
*  them in a playoff series. But the only way to beat them is just to outscore them literally. Like you
*  have to, that they're going to score on their end. So you just have to score at least one more
*  point to them on your end. And Phoenix might be the only team in the West that can, can do that was
*  where they could just be like, all right, you're definitely scoring, but we're definitely scoring
*  too. And that's how to beat them. I don't see another recipe for beating Denver.
*  I'm of the mind that you kind of got to, I'd like to see somebody build a jumbo package against them.
*  Um, if guys will remember the last time this team lost at full strength was with the Lakers,
*  Dwight Howard still has something in the tech. Minnesota has the people to do that.
*  You know, uh, like they, I think you gotta have a jumbo package available. I actually think Rudy
*  does pretty decently, um, against Jokic when they face up with each other, not that he's like killing
*  them or anything, but it's, you know, he plays pretty well against the guy, but outside of a
*  jumbo package, I don't think the outscoring thing is going to work. I don't think anything's going
*  to work. Maybe Durant and Booker are getting hot four times in a series and they win three of those
*  and then Beal has the one rando game where he has like six threes. I just can't imagine that the
*  Nuggets are losing four times to a team because of Bradley Beal. That just, no, he's fun to
*  anybody. Somebody's going to have to get injured for that, for it to be realistic. I am intrigued
*  by what was just shared because that is the way that Phoenix beat them. Um, last week they played
*  Nurkic and Eubanks 53 minutes and both those guys fouled out of the game and what they got,
*  what that got them to was overtime, but then they wanted overtime. They did outscore Denver in the
*  overtime. Um, so it is that Durant made a three, Beal made a couple of big plays. Yeah. Um, well,
*  we'll see with Bradley Beal. All right. Was, I mean, this is where the board drops. If we're
*  doing the NFL draft, this is like a swing pick right here. This could go in a lot of directions
*  right now. And you got two in a row. So what do you got? Man, I got to go back to Chicago
*  and one Nicola Vucci main Vucic. Wow. Vucic bitch. Because I don't think people realize how
*  badly this guy's thinking up the joint, um, this year at this point. So just so folks know,
*  he's got about like 66 million left for three years after this season, 41 and a half million bucks,
*  which is a bit two years. Yeah. For two years. Uh, that's what you pay a starting quality above
*  average center in this week. Is that where you pay a guy who gets replaced by Andre Drummond at
*  crunch time? It's insane. His defense is gotten worse obviously over the years with age and his
*  offense one, because he's got the sort of cultural veteran cache, guys feel a need to give him the
*  rock. Yeah. So he could quote unquote go to work on killing his team. And now he's taking threes at
*  volume and he's at like 28%. And so it's very reminiscent of what happened to house and pick
*  up basketball near the end of his career. No, near the end, near the end guys still felt like,
*  oh, it's house. We got it. We'll feed them at the top, but you know, it wasn't there in the same way.
*  This is a black hole.
*  He's so bad. And the bulls are so anonymous at this point that people don't notice,
*  but that extension they gave him has been a killer. And is he competing at this point?
*  Who was the other person in there? Like we also are at 66 for three for Vucevic.
*  I think, I think it was the, we loved Lanzo. We loved what we had when Lanzo and, you know,
*  Caruso and all these guys were cooking. During the two weeks when Lanzo and Caruso and we had.
*  So sad. I think they fell in love with that and felt like Vuce was a big part of it and it was
*  justifiable, but clearly, and then, you know, they, they gave up a bunch of pigs to bring them in just
*  terrible, terrible transaction. I really want, I'm ready for Vuce to move into the next phase of his
*  career. The Marc Gasol late 2010s, an eighth man on a good team where he comes in and every,
*  you're not relying on him, but every once in a while it's like, Oh my God, he,
*  Vucevic had 12 points in that quarter. And that's kind of where he is now, but unfortunately he's
*  the starting center on a team making 22 million a year. How's any last Vuce thoughts other than
*  the obvious wizard trade that's going to happen with him? No, no, they're not going to do that.
*  Okay. All right. Was what's your other pick? So I think it's time to get just slightly spicier.
*  I've been waiting. And I'm still not a fan of the Carl Towns deal. Okay. I'm still not a fan
*  of a guy who is a center. And I get it. He made the all-star team. He's a quality offensive player.
*  Well, say what the deal is five years. I think it's about 260 million, 257 million for this year.
*  And the next four, two, five, seven. Yes. Over the next four years after this one,
*  there will be $220 million left on Carl Towns. And at least one of the years starts with a six
*  after this year. And this is a guy who is a center who you had to go trade for someone
*  who you're now paying $45 million to do what? Play center. Okay. Because of Carl Towns' game,
*  Minnesota is paying $120 million a year in centers. Okay. They were number one in the West for like
*  60 of the days of the season so far. Look, they did not work well. They had Edward so all isn't lost.
*  And again, Carl Towns is a quality player. It's not like he's some unplayable whatever player.
*  He is not a $50 million NBA player. He's just not. I had him lower on the list.
*  I did too only because I think we got a little bit of validation of what Minnesota was after
*  in terms of bringing in Go Bear. We did see them be able to function together and his versatility
*  still I think makes him a little bit of an asset, but I was, I'm not arguing with the point.
*  I listen, he was going to get drafted. I just was grabbing him at seven was a little like when the
*  Pacers took Walker eighth last year. It was like, Whoa, he's going now. Okay. Yeah, now it's, I mean,
*  I did notice that he went out and Nas read immediately went into a spot and had like 34
*  points and looked really good. 20 million a year for Nas read center. So here was here's why I
*  didn't have him in the top 10 because I think if they shopped in the summer, I think, I think teams
*  would pay for him. Like I think the Knicks would pay for him. I think there's some teams out there.
*  They'll be like, Oh, town's is on board. We take this back plus some picks. Like, whereas
*  I just don't think Beale has a market. Yeah. Beale's market was basically somebody buying the sons
*  and just being like, ah, let's make the finals. I don't care about picks. I don't care about the
*  second apron. Let's get some players. Like he was it. He was the only guy bidding. So with towns,
*  I do feel like there's a couple of teams that would like, if for instance, Oklahoma city,
*  that's, that's a guy that they should be thinking about if he ever became available because
*  he fits what they do. They like all those permanent people. They have a million picks. I don't know if
*  they care about the money as much. Um, any other Carl Anthony towns? This is like the nicest we've
*  ever traded him in the worst contract strap. Hey, listen, look, I thought Rudy should have got his
*  spot at all star honestly, because I have a dominant defense and it's because of Rudy go bear.
*  Uh, I just, I don't know that Carl towns thing seems absurd to me. Although again, to be fair,
*  what he's done on defense this year deserves, he deserves credit for that eight years or whatever
*  we are into the Carl towns experience. He's decided that defense is a thing that matters.
*  Serious teams actually perform at, um, serious players. But yeah, that, that, that deal looks
*  absurd to me. Every time I look at that number, I'm just like blown away that Carl towns got that.
*  Was this might be one of those picks when you look back at this draft in June
*  after towns falls apart and the playoffs series and be like, whoa, great value at seven.
*  Come on, man. That was a top four pick.
*  Well, that's a perfect segue and set up into my next pick because I can absolutely tell you a
*  player and a team that would gladly take Carl Anthony towns. And that is the Atlanta Hawks in
*  exchange for Trey young. I, I'm really surprised that Trey young made it this far in this draft.
*  We still,
*  why it took them last year, like 10 spots early.
*  Right. I think he's in exactly the right spot right here at the,
*  what is it? Number eight or number nine in this draft. Yeah. Number eight.
*  He is, uh, it was a five year, $215 million deal. This is there. We need a name for this
*  class of like overpaying. It's, it's, it's your Zach Levine, your Bradley Beale, your Trey young.
*  I don't know if I want to put a KAT into this, but there is this.
*  So it's like, it's not, it's not a max deal. It's like, uh,
*  it's the first, it's his first rookie max extension, right? So towns is on his second one.
*  Right. So that's why his is so much. So first max, this is his first max. And so that's why for me,
*  it's like, he's still a borderline all star, which means he is close to like a $35 million player.
*  Like he is. So I don't see it as input in terms of production, in terms of leadership and that
*  kind of, well, it depends. Let's define production. What is his role on a team, you know, setting
*  aside and I, I'm going to, you know, recognize what I'm doing here. Um, what he did with that
*  Atlanta team in the Eastern conference playoffs, you know, a couple of years ago, can he ever do
*  that again? I, this contract is based on that performance. Well, you need Ben Simmons on the
*  other team. You need Joel and B to gag to free throws at the end of a game. There's a lot of
*  stuff that has to go your way. I think the thing with Trey young, the potential of what he is,
*  you could even see it like house and I were fascinated by the, the bedding for this season
*  where the Hawks at one point after 60 games were 22 games under 500 covering the spread.
*  What was their record? They were like 19 and 41 against the spread. Despite all evidence that
*  the Hawks were bad week after week gamblers were like, this is the week here they go. I was watching
*  highlights the other day Trey young looked amazing and then guess what? They'd fucking lose again.
*  And they just lost in Vegas is just set in the line perfectly. And all these idiots like us are
*  like, this is the week for the Hawks. They were, I like nailed most of my over-enders and I had a
*  bunch when I was in Boston, I did a bunch of like future parlays. And of course I put the fucking
*  Hawks in like four of them where I have, where I'm going to hit six of the seven win over-enders.
*  There's the Hawks who are going to be 10 wins lower. I just wonder if that's Trey's destiny
*  that they'll be dining off this 2021 playoffs for the rest of his career where we're like, well,
*  that one time remember that. And it's just, you know, maybe it was a fluke. Maybe Philly should
*  have beaten them in five. And then we would be talking about it the way we should be talking
*  about it, which is like, he is a good stats bad team player until, until we have further evidence
*  that he's not and was, I mean, you care about the Hawks the most out of the three of us. You probably
*  watch the Hawks the most. What evidence is there that he's more than a good stats bad team guy?
*  Look, I think what he does is elite is passing is elite. And under the right circumstances,
*  he can be pretty elite at scoring as well. I think the problem with that is, is the route that he
*  takes to these stats is very alienating to teammates and Trey Young being a guy who's always going to
*  need teammates to pick him up defensively. So the proposition that he's making to his teammates now
*  and in the future is watch me take all the shots, hog the ball, pass it when I feel like
*  take 40 footers on a whim and then lift me up on defense. Who signed up for that?
*  It's just an insane proposition. It's a very junior situation of the LeBron situation. LeBron's earned
*  all the accolades with this, but when you're on LeBron's team, if you win, LeBron gets all the
*  credit and if you lose, it's your fault. And if you're on Atlanta, Trey gets the credit. If
*  anything good happens, I think this is part of the Murray thing. It's always interesting when Trey
*  doesn't play what happens with Murray in those games. He's like finally, finally, I get to take
*  dad's car out of the garage. I thought it was a whiff early for Trey Young, but House, I also,
*  I respect that you're a man of principles and you stick to your guns. And it was a very predictable
*  pick. I'm going to take a break and then do my two in a row.
*  All right, coming back. I have two picks. Honestly, I'm stunned guys. I'm stunned that he's still
*  available at the ninth pick. I thought for sure he was going as one of the last two.
*  DeAndre Ayton. Yes. I'm waving the white flag. I'm not defending him anymore. I'm done. I just can't
*  do it anymore. DeAndre, it's not you. It's me. It's not you. It's me. I just need some space.
*  I can't defend you anymore, but it's, but you're great. I had a great time riding for you and
*  mentioned in 2021 finals and how, you know, you were able to kind of guard Yana sort of, and,
*  you know, you got a bad deal in Phoenix. You got blamed for everything. And if you could just
*  end up on the right team, I'm done. Can't do it. Three years, 102 million left.
*  And that's this year and the next two. He's 15 and 11. Like he's proven, he's like the guys House and
*  I grew up with these centers that can get, they can get 18 and 11. They can get 15 and 10.
*  And they don't really seem like they're always trying minus 6.7 net. I thought he was in a
*  great situation. This Portland team, Rob Williams goes down. He gets to be the starting center.
*  And it's like, all right, prove it to us, show us Phoenix made a mistake. And he kind of did the
*  opposite was. You can go, I want to say 10, 12, 13 possessions at a time without even noticing this
*  man is on the court. Okay. Both ends. It's insane how bad this guy has been this year to me. And
*  again, this is relative to the deal. He gets paid like an upper echelon starting center in the NBA.
*  He is nowhere close to that. He's again, he's not a negative. So, you know, he's not Jordan pool range
*  where he's actively hurting his team every single minute that he's on the floor. But my God, the
*  dominant, too much money allocated to further production. Like would you rather have Luke
*  Cornett for $2 million a year or Deandre Ayton for 30? Siamia for Cornett. Thank you. I don't know
*  if you've seen him lately, but he might be a $30 million a year guy the way it's going for Luke
*  Cornett. It's a good room protection house. You try to talk yourself into Ayton with the wizards
*  a bunch of times. Is that I thought there was a possibility that that was he was going to be part
*  of the Bradley Beal thing because it was apparent. It seemed that Phoenix was thinking about moving
*  on from him. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good. I'm all good with, with, with Mr. Aiden.
*  Well, maybe, maybe Portland signs Buddy Hill this summer, get a little Bahamas reunion. Maybe
*  that'll get him going. I just like, if it didn't happen this year with no Rob Williams, I don't
*  know if it ever happens. All right. So Ayton one pick, I'm going to admit defeat on him.
*  I have two guys on my board. One is like an underrated drive by. And then the other one is
*  super spicy. And I think I can get the super spicy guy in a couple of picks.
*  I'm going to go with Kelden Johnson.
*  Probably weren't expecting him in the top 10. He's a four year, four years, 74 million.
*  Yet another guy when everyone, when we have to talk about how smart the Spurs are, even though
*  there's been really no evidence since 2017 that they're either smarter or dumber than anyone else.
*  Like literally there's none. Nobody can come up with any evidence. What are you talking about?
*  They stumbled into weapon.
*  Next generation of talent. They're geniuses.
*  They, they, you know, if you just go through the moves, not great, but they gave Kelden Johnson
*  this extension and he's dropped from 22 points to 16 points a game, 33% three point field goal.
*  The last two years, he's got the worst net rating on the Spurs minus 8.5. And I test wise, I'm like
*  fucking a man like Wemby needs better teammates. And one of the guys you look at right away is like,
*  I wish Kelden Johnson was better. So you go from your 22 point a game score and a really bad team
*  to now that you have a good teammate, it should make you better. And it just doesn't feel like
*  it has. So, uh, I don't know who would be excited to trade for that contract house.
*  Um, sure. Except for it's not that much money is the thing.
*  It's like 18, 19 million. It's 20 million this year and it goes backwards.
*  But that's fun to see. So to me, the reason why I don't like your pig bill is because there's a guy
*  on his team, Zach Collins. I mean, good Lord, what does he play with when he's, he's got 34 million
*  two years after this one. Okay. So yeah, like Zach Collins, he didn't make my draft list. He has 34
*  million, 34 million over the next two seasons after this one can't play with Wemby. Obviously
*  can't man lineups without them. Um, and they just paid him blindly for just like on
*  now he's 22. Oh no, they got it. He got an extension. Jesus. Two year, 34 million extension
*  next to this one, but he's only at 7.7 this year. Yes. Two years, 34 million in the next two years.
*  He's just been wiped out of the rotation, wiped out of existence. He does nothing. Is that your
*  next pick? Oh no, you're not up. Well, no, cause I, cause I got, I gotta go spicy my next few. Oh no,
*  you're not. Oh, I can't wait. I like it. Well, we just went, now I regret not going spicier, but yeah,
*  I just, I wanted to lash out against the Spurs cause the Wemby thing makes me so mad. That's,
*  that's why we're here to pick you up. Can you put a fucking better team around Wemby? I say it every
*  podcast house you're up. Um, well, I, I'm kind of surprised with the Deandre Ayton pick. Um,
*  because the combination of his age and the duration of the contract, there is still an out.
*  That out doesn't exist with his teammate, Jeremy Grant, who is in the first year of a five year,
*  $160 million deal. This guy is making 27 and a half million this year, 28.8, 29.8 next year, 32.
*  And he's, he's, he's 30 years old. So I mean, congratulations to Jeremy Grant, by the way,
*  tremendous job, like turning himself into two great deals. He's like the new Kirk cousins.
*  He really is. That's just a great call. So I, I, in house, I had him in my top 10 and then I went
*  and looked at his stats this year. Cause I, from watching Portland, I was like, yeah, Jeremy
*  Grant's pretty good. And is he's averaging 21 a game and shooting 38% from three. Like he's a good
*  player. He is for sure. He's just too overpaid. And Portland's atrocious. And it makes no sense
*  at all for them to, to, to have, they, they have $60 million combined going to Deandre Ayton and
*  Jeremy Grant. And they have these, the kids who really should be getting that this run, um, you
*  know, they have to find out what they got with scoot. Uh, Simon's still, still, you know, salvageable.
*  Um, Shaden sharps legit. Uh, I don't know. I mean, if it's a go along to get along contract,
*  it just feels like that's what it is. And it feels expensive to me. He could be a very valuable
*  player in a different kind of circumstance altogether, but I don't know what he's doing
*  on Portland at that price. The reason he wasn't up on my list is that I think the second this
*  season's over, they'll be getting calls on him again and they'll be able to extract value out of,
*  um, his deal again. And so like, they just punted on it. This, this, uh, this past trade
*  deadline, cause they're like, people are going to want this guy because like you said, he's
*  shooting 38%. Although I do think, I think he's a little bit overrated. Like I do think that,
*  but I think his perception because he plays a premium position cause he's got great size and
*  he's making his threes. Um, I think people will still call them for him and he will, he will draw
*  some, some damn, some interest this summer again. So that's why he was low for me. Although again,
*  I do think he's a bit overrated in that way. I like house. I thought you made the key point
*  about where he is the last two years of that deal when he's in his mid thirties
*  and maybe not as exciting to pay 34 year old Jeremy Grant 32 million. So how spot on low.
*  All right. Well, as you're on the clock with two
*  Kawhi Leonard just left the freaking Clippers game with back spasms. So now we're adding back
*  spasms to a Gimpy, meniscus and ACL. I mean, the injuries just never stopped piling up for this guy.
*  And yes, obviously when he plays, he's a borderline MVP candidate, but he never plays
*  and he's going to make $50 million. Three years preceding this. Um, that is,
*  Oh, that is a scary proposition. So to me, I'm making that bet that he's just not going to be
*  on the court. And that is for expenses. Four years this year, plus the next three, he's making 45.6
*  this year. And then a new extension kicks in from uncle Steve. Uncle Steve's like, I got a new arena.
*  Yeah. Who wants some money? And he gave Kawhi three years, $149.65 million house.
*  I mean, what would you say for when you throw in Kawhi's history and the curse of the Clippers,
*  what is the over under for Kawhi games in the three year extension? If you had to bet,
*  I'm going to set it at 140 games. Would you go over or under?
*  Way under. That's a, that's an outrageous number. 140. Would you go under us?
*  You have to play 141 regular season games next year. Including this year? No, next year. No,
*  no, next year. The three years. I'm going under. That's 50. That's 50 a season, right? No. Yeah.
*  Under, under, under, under, under, way under. So that, all right. So and I'd count the postseason
*  in that too. So that's basically you're saying he's going to make more than a million a game.
*  Oh yeah. Absolutely. Well, the funny thing is we do the Ringer 100 voting and,
*  and I think I had Kawhi as the sixth best player in the league. Yeah. I just wouldn't want to pay
*  him $200 million. I'd want to pay him by the season. He just doesn't play. He doesn't play.
*  He doesn't play. He's a liability that way. He doesn't play. But if he's healthy come these
*  playoffs and, and, you know, uh, Harden and, and George are healthy. He just left the game. He just
*  left the game and went to the hospital with bad spasms. It's a regular season. It's a regular
*  season. Okay. It wasn't great. They got drugs for that. Okay. Was what's your other pick?
*  CJ McCollum. I mean, fair. He's just, he's just got such a great reputation in the media. He's
*  a media member himself. Like nobody would ever come after CJ McCollum because he's such a positive,
*  well liked, so polished and all of that. I don't fall for it. It's a bad deal.
*  The guy can't guard anybody. He's not a point guard. He's not like a,
*  a setup guy, set the table type of guy. Thankfully he's shooting threes at volume
*  for the first time in his career. Really like he's always been like a sort of mid range darling.
*  But guess what? He's the third sort of setup guy on this team. Doesn't guard people. And all he
*  does is spot up essentially. He's overpaid two more years at 32 million a pop after this year.
*  So 64 million after this year. If you count this year, $100 million. So CJ McCollum could be a
*  glorified microwave dude. I think that's absurd. Overpaid as hell. Bad contract. CJ McCollum
*  rounds out my roster. That was my favorite wise pick of the draft.
*  I'm not falling for this media glad handing. I'm not going to fall for it. I'm too impartial.
*  What are your additional thoughts?
*  I mean, he was staring me right at the face. It was, it's right. He's getting paid for something
*  that doesn't have to do with going out and playing basketball and helping his team with
*  basketball games. I like them, but sometimes this happens where what's weird is they double down on
*  it. He was pretty pricey when they got him and then they're like, Hey, how about two more years?
*  Feels like the 25 range is the right range for him. And he's, he's above that. All right. House,
*  who do you have? I have a, I ask a technical question because I have a combo, but I don't know.
*  This would be the first time in the history of the worst contract thing. What this is really
*  amounts to is an indictment of one particular team, but I don't want to, I could just say one of the
*  players and you would understand who the other side of the coin is. I'll do it. However, the pod
*  father dictates, but I'm asking permission for a combo pick here. Cause I don't think you'd have
*  to forfeit next round's pick, but I'll allow it. Cause I like it. I don't think you're going to take
*  any of my snake picks. I don't think so either. I'm looking at Deandre Hunter and John Collins
*  and wondering what in the hell was Atlanta doing two years ago? What in God, John Collins is,
*  is now in the third year of a five year, $125 million deal. And the Andre Hunter still has,
*  you know, four years, $80 million. I believe. I have him for four for 90. This is your one
*  of its extension. Yeah. Right. So three years after this and it's 90 million total for the four years.
*  This is how you create teams that, that, that, that can't possibly find their way to success.
*  This gross overpaying role players. These guys, what contribution does John Collins make to a
*  winning basketball team? Now the curious thing, both these guys are 26 years old.
*  The knock on John Collins three for 78.6, by the way, including this year,
*  what's left. 26 million a year for this year. Next to. Yeah. And Hunter had, you know,
*  garnered this reputation of being a defensive ace, except for he can't play. When he does play,
*  he doesn't play very good defense. So I'm happy to use both of my picks right now on this
*  disastrous Atlanta tandem. And this is three picks in a row for me with Atlanta. And honestly,
*  it might be the only franchise that, that, that gives me hope with my Washington franchise
*  because of, of like, they really do rival Washington in terms of grossly overpaying
*  role players for third and fourth, not even really third, fourth and fifth bananas on teams
*  that actually have aspirations for winning. I'm glad you're blaming Atlanta for the contract,
*  even though it's now on Utah. It's telling that when they traded him to Utah,
*  Utah was like, here's our offer. Nothing. Right. They did the Michael Corleone.
*  Here's my offer. Zero. We'll just take the contract and give you a bag of balls back.
*  The Collins thing is interesting because I do like his game, but yeah, I, if the three point
*  shooting was in the forties. Yeah. Never came back around. Honestly, he broke the hand and it never
*  came back around. And I feel bad because I've been a John Collins apologists for about four
*  years. And I thought the Utah thing would finally be able to turn it around, but it turns out he's
*  just a nice little low end starter. He was definitely on my board because he gets paid
*  like a sort of premium power forward type and Utah, he gets plenty of opportunities, plays around
*  plenty of space. Like they got a creative offense and it just hasn't worked out. It's just, he's not
*  worth the deal that he's on. It's just a fact. There's no two ways about it. Deandre Hunter's
*  not a starter. He's not a guy. He's not a guy. And he got his deal at a time where everybody was
*  just like, oh, the way the cap is spiking and blah, blah, blah. Like you could never overpay for a
*  little role player, three and D wing guy. It doesn't matter if he can't dribble or shoot or pass. It's
*  all good. It's going to work out. And it just didn't. And yeah, I think Hunter is a way worse
*  value on his contract than, than John Collins is only because I can see John Collins get meaningful
*  minutes for like a real team. Hunter's, Hunter's at least in threes this year. He was not last year.
*  We're gonna take one more break. And when we come back, I am bringing the momo fuku spice
*  and we are about to give, give this podcast a shocker.
*  All right. For my next two picks, I dedicate both of these picks to Gilbang.
*  Curb your enthusiasm. What was it? Episode three or four, the shocker.
*  Gilbang was on the porn set all day and you know what? His equipment wasn't totally working.
*  And then somebody had an idea to put a little Tabasco in his ass. And it turned out it wasn't
*  the actress he was working with. It was the cameraman. And he told a whole story and Larry's
*  wife was horrified. And this was the first great curb your enthusiasm episode. And house and I
*  revere Gilbang. I'm Gil banging both of these picks. First off, Lamelo ball. Welcome to the draft.
*  Yeah. Sheesh. I mean, honestly, for the love of God, the mellow ball, 10 million this year,
*  his extension hasn't even kicked in yet. Five years, 204.5 million starting next year
*  for the mellow ball. Who's played 58 games last year and this year, who every time I watch the
*  Hornets, he's just in street clothes, smiling as they're down 20. I have no idea if he could be
*  even the second best player in a good team. From a culture standpoint, we've now had a whole
*  presidential term with him and. I don't see it. I know the talent is there, but this feels like
*  somebody who's going to break some hearts along the way where it's oh, man, he's so talented. Oh,
*  did you see he had a 36, 15 and 10 last night? And. I don't see it. I don't like where it's gone was
*  in the mellow ball is my first pick. Yeah, I mean, I feel you. He's somebody I thought about myself.
*  The talent is obviously there. He's obviously still super young. I don't think he's plateaued
*  in terms of output when he's actually played. He's shooting threes at pretty nice volume, 36%.
*  You can't be mad at that. That's not scintillating, but it's like, OK, this is respectable.
*  He's always had the core vision, always had the size. Let's get those positives out the way.
*  He does not play. He is highly unserious, is not a defensive player yet, even with all of the size
*  and. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know yet. I think the yet is going to be standing for the next 10
*  years. And like, there's just no proof that a guy like who never played this guy does. He's got to
*  get on the court. And when he's on the court, he has to be a serious person. Like, I know it's like
*  some of this stuff is very cosmetic. It's like, oh, he's not moping on a bench. Well, sometimes
*  you should mope. Your team stinks and you're never on the floor. Stop showing up the games
*  and goofing around. You know what I mean? Like, I get it. This is a scary, scary, scary situation.
*  Good thing they got Randy Miller. Maybe this segment will be a PSA for him.
*  LaMelo Ball, we all think you're talented. What we don't want is 10 years from now on whatever
*  Twitter ends up being in 2034 is the 90 second montage of some media going, LaMelo Ball is a
*  problem. And it's these little ball highlights. Oh, man, the mill, a ball is really good. Your
*  destiny can't be the 90 second Twitter montage of that. You were a problem when you didn't make the
*  playoffs ever. So get your shit together. The mill, a ball. What do you have to add house?
*  I feel the exact same way. Stop the clowny pants. I mean, this is the thing is, is there,
*  you know, I'm not going to besmirch the family, but we have a problem with getting the balls on
*  the basketball court. That is now a documented fact. So we all, we all love Lonzo. And to me,
*  that was like, I don't know what happened with his knee, but I, we've at least seen moments from
*  Lonzo where it's like, this guy is a winning player who has real value and adds something to
*  good teams. And LaMelo just seems like a guy who's a good stats, bad team guy. And he's not,
*  doesn't seem like a culture guy, at least not yet, but he's young. Maybe there's a chance, but.
*  And again, just, just the opposite end of the spectrum with a young guy. And some of this stuff
*  is structural for me in the sense that LaMelo ball has accomplished practically nothing in the NBA.
*  And he's already got, he's, if he does, if he doesn't live a single finger again, he will have
*  earned $250 million. And at a certain point, it's like, you can't tell me my career has panned out
*  bad in that sense. So with, with, with that being said, what's his incentive to turn into a serious
*  player? Turn that to a Victor Wimby Yamu, who I'm not going to lie. I was pretty skeptical. Like
*  he's going to come in here and kick everybody's ass. He's a dog. He's yelling at his teammates.
*  He's playing hard. He's taking defense. He's serious. He is taking it so freaking serious.
*  And that's what you want to see out of a young guy. Yeah. And we're not seeing it. So we all agree.
*  Something's missing. Can't put my finger on it, but the way Wise just spelled out the Wimby thing
*  that's exactly how I feel. You either have that. I want to dominate and I want to kick ass and I
*  want to be awesome and I want my team to be awesome. Or you're just playing basketball to get stats and
*  look cool. Yeah. And Instagram followers. Maybe there's still time for the mellow ball.
*  All right. My other pick also another Gil Banger
*  This year in the next three, he's owed $207.3 million.
*  He's going to be 37 years old getting a paycheck that starts with a six for the year.
*  He's good once a week. Not positive, but his best years might be behind him. We're about to find out
*  over the next three months.
*  Every once in a while he gets absolutely torched by somebody.
*  I hope he doesn't make a diss track about me.
*  Jamie Lillard. It's just too much money and it's money that scares the fucking shit out of me.
*  If I'm the bucks for three years from now, it's a terrifying number.
*  So for what we're seeing now and think that he's be three years older in three years,
*  and we're going to be paying 60 plus million.
*  House, it just, it's, it's, it makes you gulp.
*  I made this case on this show a year ago with, you know, there were still only four years left,
*  but it is, it's about his age at the end of this deal. Now, the thing that you better than me and
*  maybe have a perspective on what the next media deal might look like.
*  So there could be a form of cap relief, you know, as you, when they, when teams like the
*  book, it's going to be as exciting of a media deal as everybody seems to think.
*  Okay. All right. But we do think the cap will go up some amount, right?
*  I think we'll still get those 10% raises. I believe so. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So that, that creates a little bit of room.
*  Well, let me ask you this.
*  Not enough.
*  If you're a network and you're like, all right, what am I paying for?
*  The two most famous players in your league are 39 and 35.
*  What's, what's year seven of my deal looking like?
*  I better really believe in Anthony Edwards and Jason Tatum and Wemba Nyama.
*  Who's a French guy.
*  Fair enough. Fair enough.
*  Like is, so the biggest player, the, all the biggest players in your league are not going
*  to be from America. Yeah, it's tough.
*  It's tough. Like Jokic is the best part of the league and it's not close right now.
*  And I feel like the ringer probably spends the most time talking about him, but I, you know,
*  I don't know if he's a national guy like LeBron and Curry. I don't think it's ever happening.
*  I also don't think he gives a shit, but I don't know what I'm paying for. If I'm the,
*  if I'm the networks, why, like, why do I have to pay a 25% premium on where we were already?
*  Well, I think maybe if you think you're a network and you're just better at selling this package
*  of goods than the previous partners were, because let's face it, they haven't been always awesome
*  at doing that. Don't want to say no names, but maybe that's, that's the play. It's like, yo,
*  I think this is a depressed asset and I can do way better with this, what these guys have to sell
*  than what, you know, the current partners are doing. I think that's the only way to spin it.
*  When you look at, you know, some of the current numbers and trends, et cetera, et cetera.
*  The problem is what Derek Thompson talked about on this podcast a couple of weeks ago is there's
*  so many basketball fans who don't actually watch that much of the games, but they follow the league
*  religiously on social media. Like my son, my son knows everything when Benyama is doing. I,
*  I know for a fact he hasn't sat down and watched more than like five minutes of his first game with
*  me. So how do you sell that to networks? I think it's a, I think it's a problem. Anyway, we'll see
*  if the, if the cap goes up, the Dame contract, not that bad. I just know house is terrified.
*  You want to get through another podcast about a Dame lowered, uh, this track or anything. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Any sort of eye emoji. If they make it to the, to the finals this year, the NBA finals this
*  year, then it'll all be worth it. I mean, I think if I, if you put that on the table next, when they
*  retool this summer, where they actually have the ability to add to the roster and not just be
*  trotting out like, you know, a joke of a wing rotation. I think this year and next will be the
*  window. And I think Dame has been out of rhythm, out of sorts. He's definitely obviously clearly
*  not having as good a season as he had last year, but I think he can bounce back. I think he's got
*  it in him. Um, I'm not as down on Dame as you two guys are, but I understand the trepidation.
*  I'm down at the 50 plus million a year. It's just in general, but that number is terrifying
*  no matter who the player is, unless it's like Jokic. Um, house, what's your next pick? Well,
*  I used the combo and you said I had to skip. Oh yeah. So what's up? What's it? What do you got?
*  All right. We're getting down to the nitty gritty here. We may, we may have two more rounds in us.
*  So that we'll go this round next round and we're, and we're a rep and we can go MPJ MPJ for me.
*  Still, you look good. Good. Last night. Listen, look, I just think Jokic is,
*  he, he, he lifts all boats, man. Uh, this guy, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
*  it's can't be overstated how much he elevates all the things that are around him. I think Jamal
*  Murray is an amazing player. You know, I think he is extremely complimentary of what Yo, um,
*  Jokic brings to the table. I don't think without Jokic, you'd be some world beating, dominating
*  one. I just, I don't, I think the world of the guy and I think he's great for this team. He's
*  extremely clutch, but I think because he gets to work off of Jokic, that thing looks beautiful.
*  Same with MPJ. Like he's, he's doesn't got any moves. He's would never be any ball dominant guy.
*  He's not some prime clay Thompson, just deathly scaring everybody with what he's doing with
*  movement shooting and shooting and all of that. And respect to him for becoming a plus defender,
*  actually using his size and all of that. But like you think about the back,
*  you think about the, it's only a matter of time before this guy's probably like, yo, man,
*  I need more touches. I need to rock more. I'm just thinking in the future. So MPJ,
*  I'm looking at that contract and, and yeah, I'm not, I'm not too, too crazy about it.
*  So we got 115 million for this year and the next two, three years, 115 million kind of this year,
*  history of back issues, although he's been really healthy and I, I'll be the 170th person to make
*  this point on a podcast this year, but he definitely is the X factor of that team. It seems like when
*  he plays well, they're unbeatable and they might be unbeatable anybody, but when he plays well,
*  you're like, holy shit, now what, now what happens? And if you do that playoff series twice
*  per playoff series, you know, that's a win for him. House is just thinking about him ending up
*  on the wizard. It's like three years from now. He's the perfect wizard. House likes MPJ. See,
*  he doesn't, house doesn't want to say it, but you're kind of an MPJ guy. All right,
*  Waz, what's your other pick? Just cause I have to, it's a bonus. I mean, wow. I can't do this.
*  Y'all not going to get me to buy this thing. I'm never going to buy this thing.
*  The T-Rex arms at center, I'm never going to buy it. I get it. He's a focal point of what they're
*  doing on offense and he doesn't always embarrass himself on defense and he plays hard and he's a
*  positive guy, but he's got four years, 186 left after this year. Okay. Which again, over $200
*  million when you- That was an Uncle Vivek. Uncle Vivek's like, you've heard of Uncle Steve. Here's
*  Come on now for six foot eight center. I just, I can't, who doesn't shoot threes?
*  I can't be, he killed Anthony Davis last night. Well, it's like, I'm not impressed. That's all he
*  does. During the postseason. It's fair. I'm not, I'm not buying this bonus thing. Y'all can buy it.
*  I'm not. So basically five years, 214 million for him, if you include this year. I mean, we took a
*  lot of heat Simmons when we, you and I were together looking at the lists of potential all
*  stars and we didn't know exactly what to do with the bonus. The light, the beam people came at us
*  for not having, and he, he does have this incredible double, double streak going into the season.
*  You know, not only that, but it's production that matters. Like, you know, they, they beat the Lakers
*  ass last night. Uh, because he, he's, you know, he, he, he's very challenging to Anthony Davis.
*  I guess my question is, and I know this kind of defeats the purpose of the worst contract
*  draft, but every team kind of has to have at least one guy making over 40, right? Yeah.
*  And probably two, you know, this is the situation Lakers are in that we're still, and I talked
*  about, like, if you, you basically, every team has the spot and the guys are going to make between
*  40 and 50. And if you pick your two guys and they're making it combined 90 to a hundred,
*  what are those two? What's the ceiling with those two guys? That's what everybody has to figure out.
*  So if you're the Kings, you're like, all right, here's, we have Fox Fox on a pretty good deal
*  because he's under 40 because they signed it two years ago and some bonus. So we're paying like
*  85 million maybe for those two together. What's our ceiling? And then you can talk yourself into,
*  well, we had the number one offense last year. We're really fun to watch. He likes being in
*  Sacramento. Bouncing the first round by Jordan Poole. I get it. The case for the contract is
*  this guy actually likes being in Sacramento. Our fans like him and our team's pretty good.
*  With all that said, it's too much money for sub bonus. I agree. It seems high.
*  Your ceiling is very low. What's your other pick?
*  No, those were the two. No, I made MPJ and sub bonus. Oh yeah, you did MPJ and sub bonus.
*  So house is up. He did too. I have a confession. Is this the last pick or the second to last pick?
*  This is the second to last pick, but we can help feed you if you're out of things.
*  No, no, no. I just have a confession. There's a name on this list that I'm just staring at it.
*  I don't want to say it. I don't want to say it.
*  Go bang us. Give it to us. I'm going to save it. I'll save it for the last pick.
*  This is low hanging fruit staring us right in the face. Whatever Pascal Siakam's next deal is,
*  it's going to be a gross, grotesque overpay. It's going to be a preposterous.
*  We're all so certain that it's going to be a max. Do the Pacers really have to do that?
*  I don't know if it's going to be a max, but it's probably going to be like 40, 42 range.
*  I think it's going to be like 220 for five years, something like that.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  For me. Yeah.
*  For what? The problem is they have a truly transcendent talent in Halle, right? And so
*  you have to surround him with complimentary pieces. And so far it seems like-
*  You got to overpay for the piece.
*  Yeah.
*  But is that the piece? That's the piece you're going to overpay for?
*  You want him to be your third best guy. He can't be second.
*  I would sign that deal and then immediately try and trade him for Carl Anthony Towns.
*  If I was to do that deal, that's what I would try to do.
*  I'm an indie optimist. And what I will say is that since Halliburton got hurt and he
*  rushed back, he just hasn't been the same. So I'm not going to judge the Siakam trade
*  too harshly right now because Halliburton isn't at his best. And ultimately Halliburton
*  has to be at his best so we can see what it really looks like.
*  For sure.
*  But yeah, the Siakam deal, it can be a little bit, it's kind of scary.
*  I will say to me he is in the class with Julius Randall and Jalen Brown where it's like,
*  oh man, how much money is it? Oh, he doesn't do this. He doesn't do that. But when they're
*  on your team, it's a nice guy to have on the team. All three of those guys are three of the
*  10 best forwards in the league and they play. They're durable. You know what you're getting.
*  You watch Indiana at the end of games and it's like Siakam will make a really good play with
*  90 seconds left. Like he's been in big games. I like him. I just think he's too expensive.
*  That's it. He's going to be too expensive. He will be on this list next year. He definitely
*  knows how to play and that is a very good reason to have him on a team with the youth that
*  Indianapolis has. I do wonder a tiny bit. It looks to me like his athleticism is diminishing.
*  I do think that. Wadsley, yeah, immediately. So that makes me feel better.
*  All right. So I have to pay nine. Like he's on the other side of that hill. Yep.
*  I have two picks left. The first one's easy. I'm offended that he hasn't gone yet.
*  He's making for this year and the next three, four years, 94 million dollars.
*  And to me, it's like for what he does during a game, I can find 30 guys in the league who
*  basically does this. It's cam Johnson on the Brooklyn Nets. It's like, oh yeah, they traded
*  the rant. They got, they got a McKell bridges back and they got cam Johnson. They resigned him
*  to almost a hundred million dollars and he's going to blossom. Well, where's the blossom?
*  He's he, first of all, he, he's one of the few people who failed by team USA theory. Usually
*  when you play on team USA, you come back and you're better. He's somehow worse. He's three
*  points worse. Three point shooting is fine. He's a 40% three point shooter, but that's really it.
*  Doesn't really rebound. Doesn't really pass solid defender. It's a three and D guy. Why do I have
*  to pay a three and D guy? 22 million, 23, $24 million a year. I don't want to. No, thank you.
*  It's the same conundrum. You're in with Deandre Hunter. It's like, cool. I'm getting all this
*  stuff, but can I patch this together and find people that I'm paying $5 million a year for?
*  So anyway, I'm a little dissatisfied. I thought he'd be better this year and he's just not. So
*  he's one of my picks. Cam Johnson is like a Teyvon Austin type. Every time somebody thinks about him
*  or brings him, Oh, Teyvon Austin, he's unlocked some stuff. Such a great piece. And it's so
*  explosive. And it's like, bro, he's dropping 40 in the spiked basketball era. It's like the Brady
*  Anderson 50 home run situation. We're in the spike stats era and the stats went down.
*  Yeah. But what I'm saying is remember those games where he dropped 40 like three times in a row and
*  it was like, Oh, when Kyrie left the team at first, that's what got people really excited about this
*  dude. But yeah, I've never saw it for him. He's the poster child of, are we really sure that
*  Brooklyn's trying to win? I mean, it's the conversation at the top. I understand the point
*  about them not having a picture or anything, but right, right. This guy, this is, this is exactly
*  why I asked the question. The Nets can lose to anybody. They prove it at time and time again.
*  They'll lose to any team in the entire NBA on any given night. And this guy at this salary is part
*  and parcel of it. There is no proof to me that that's a serious team with serious intention to
*  trying to win. But good luck. Good luck to them. Well, the good news is they haven't changed their
*  front office in 10 years. Can I make a quick defense of Cam Johnson, even though I just picked
*  him in the worst contract draft, please. If Cam Johnson was here as I can, what happened this year?
*  I think his response would be my point guards were Spencer did with a cam Thomas and Dennis
*  Smith Jr. That's what happened. Give me a real fucking point guard. Maybe, maybe you'd see your
*  20 points a game. Okay. Leave me alone. All right. My last pick. This is emotional. I'm sad it's over.
*  I was really having a good time. There's some good ones left.
*  But I gotta go.
*  This just is it's been jumping out at me. I can't stop staring at it.
*  This year in the next five, $262 million for Anthony Davis, who was 31 years old.
*  It's not a bad pig who's been playing big minutes really since he got in the league,
*  who hasn't exactly been Mr. Durability. No. And look, I don't mind the number this year.
*  I don't mind it next year. I don't mind it the year after that. But now you're taking me into
*  the rest of the 2020s. You're taking me into he's going to be 35 years old, 36 years old, 37 years
*  old, making $60 million. What is that going to look like? What is our evidence of big guys
*  hitting like the year 14, 15, 16, 17 of their career and still being awesome? I thought it was a
*  kind of perplexing extension. I didn't really understand it because they already had them
*  under contract. And that's just a, that's a lot of money house.
*  It is the one of the curiosities of the way that the NBA contracts have to work. There is no
*  mechanism by which you can reward a player. And it literally is the thing that Washington,
*  I'm very accustomed to this and seasons when a Poland owned the team years where guys had good
*  seasons, they would come back and they would get like giant contract extensions without really any
*  bottom of what, what does this do to the cap? What's our team building thesis? It was nope.
*  We had a good season last season extensions for everybody. And so it's, it's because there is no
*  way to truly compensate guys for, you know, uh, uh, resetting the direction of a team, resetting
*  the trajectory of a franchise. I think Anthony Davis, 10 year house, I fucked up. I said, uh,
*  I said six years, 256 million. It's five years, 256 million. So it's 83 million this year and
*  next year. And then the extension that kicks in is three years, 177 million, culminating with
*  a player option in 27, 28 for $62.97 million. Anthony Davis has already picked that up.
*  It's just a bonus. He's he got, they gave him a bonus. They gave him a bonus because he helped
*  them be competitive. He was a running mate for LeBron. He made the Lakers relevant. They won,
*  the, the, you know, the summer camp title, um, in 2020. So look, you know, those are all
*  meaningful things. I, I'm fine with, with rewarding him for that, but, uh, right.
*  I, I cannot wait for Waz's take cause he's making a face.
*  No, I listened. I think AD, um, like you guys said, the reason he's at the back of this thing
*  is cause for the next three years, he's going to justify whatever he's getting paid. But once he
*  gets up in the years, when you count the injuries and I think of a big man who's playing well into
*  his mid to late thirties, which is Al Horford, but his game isn't so predicated on athleticism,
*  like AD's is. Al Horford is like spreading you out to three. AD can't shoot threes. You know,
*  AD is counting on catching lobs and, and, you know, being really athletic on the perimeter,
*  on switches and stuff like that. Uh, I don't know that that kind of stuff is going to be greatly
*  diminished at the end of this deal. So I get it, but I'm an AD guy. So I'm a, I, I, I, I.
*  For me, he's second team all NBA this year. Yeah. Cause I'm going to still vote with positions. I
*  think he's been the second best center in the league and it's perplexing to me that he's been
*  as good as he's been in the Lakers have been better. I'm just looking, we've followed the NBA
*  too long and house and I are older than you was, but you, this, these athletic tall big guys who
*  can't shoot from deep. It goes, Germaine O'Neal, it was over all of a sudden and three different
*  teams try to talk themselves into him after it was over. And he went to like Miami and he went to
*  Toronto and it was just like, when it's over, it's over. And I just think it's going to be abrupt
*  with him. Cause of what you're talking about with the athleticism. Um, he's not going to have a plan
*  B. Horford was able to refashion himself around a lot of the skills he had, but he also wasn't
*  making $62 million in the final year of his deal. So that last deal with, with, with Elton Brand,
*  that was, that was tough. Yeah, true. True. They did have to attach a first round pick to trade it.
*  All right. House your last pick. Okay. So here's the name that I've been staring at. This is a
*  confession and I'm not going to select him out of respect and love for our beloved colleague, Chris
*  Vernon, but John Moran, it's 5,000 with the last 18 months of John Moran. Well, there's a lot of
*  uncertainty. Now it's, it's, it's everything because we want him to play in this league,
*  the TV contracts that we're talking about. He should be asserting himself as the best American
*  player. Like he should be in that. We should be, it should be him, John Moran going head to head
*  with Anthony Edwards, going head to head with Jason Tatum and Zion and Zion and Halliburton.
*  Let's get some Americans in the mix, baby. Yeah. We just got to get every, the past 18 months in the
*  rear view mirror as quickly as possible. And so I am not going to sit here and cast his contract.
*  It's a fair level of compensation. It's the same amount of money that Zion's making. I think it's
*  fair. The extensions for both those guys after the rookie contracts. Zion did get drafted last year.
*  He did. I know, but he, he deserved it because he, there was no proof that he could play a full
*  basketball season. Looks like a knock on wood. Like let's not jinx Zion. I want Zion in the playoffs.
*  All right. So who's your pick? Got to be Kyle Kuzma. And the reason is because
*  Kyle Kuzma took an extension from the Washington Terrible franchise and
*  they put him on the table as they told him that he was going to be. And they had a deal in principle
*  with the Dallas Mavericks. And he said that the team asked him, do you want to go to Dallas and
*  play with Kyrie and Luca? And Kyle Kuzma said, nah, I'm good. This is great. I love it right here.
*  Kyle Kuzma, he said he wants to build something special in DC with you guys. Come on now. He's
*  he's looking forward to opening up that new building. It's been a special year. That new building in
*  Northern Virginia. He's excited to open that thing up, House. It's the funniest thing I ever heard.
*  I love this so much. Do you want to go to Dallas and play with a team that's going to make a deep
*  run potentially in the playoffs? No, I'm good. I would love to know the validity of that idea.
*  I would imagine that the deal fell through and Kuzma was like, I know I was supposed to be traded,
*  but I still like being here because he's a nice guy. I've had a theory on this. Let's hear it.
*  Kuzma played with poor Zinkus last year. Yes, he did. Might have made a call, huh?
*  Yeah. Probably hung out right on the road a little bit. Hey, what was it like to play with
*  Luca? Maybe he heard some stuff. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised. Interesting.
*  And by the way, guess who was pretty miserable playing in Dallas? Poor Zinkus. And guess who
*  immediately left Dallas and was good on Washington and now in Boston? Poor Zinkus. And I wonder if
*  Kuzma's like, man, I already did that. I won a title doing that with LeBron. I don't need to win
*  another title. I have a ring. I'll stay here and I get a lot of shots. Maybe Jordan Poole will be
*  good again in the 2020s. I can see it. Maybe he likes DC. Maybe he likes the DMV. House, you haven't
*  left the DMV since we graduated college. I honestly have no problem at all with Kuzma.
*  And I think that contract is honestly fair. He's a good fourth player, fifth player, fifth player.
*  Contract is expensive. I think that's a good Kuzma contract, especially just before we get out of
*  here, obviously. Just a couple that I had up here that you guys didn't mention. You're up. You have
*  the last pick. You got to finish it up. Oh yeah, it's you. Yeah. Kuzma, you're the second to last pick.
*  You're wrapping a set plus. It's not Nerkish for me. It's Tyler. It's Tyler Hero. It's Tyler Hero.
*  Oh, I'm glad he got taken. It's the Jordan Poole deal. Good job. Essentially the exact same deal.
*  It's four years, 120, right? We're four years, 126. Three years, 99 mil at the end of this season.
*  He just has not lived up to it. They went to the finals without him last year. It's like, it's tough.
*  He basically was part of the reason they couldn't get Damon there because everybody thinks he stinks.
*  He does shoot it still, you know, but he doesn't really do anything else. That's a tough, tough
*  contract. Tyler Hero. Now you got Heat Nation against you. Now you have a weird
*  coming out wise. Do we really think that Heat Nation takes slams Tyler Hero? That's going to be a headlight now.
*  Does Heat Nation stand by Tyler Hero? I don't think so. Well, they try to trade him out. I don't think so either.
*  I don't think so either. Yeah, it's been on the trade on eBay. It feels like a lifetime. I think they've moved on to
*  Jovich and Jaime Jaquez, who are legitimately good rookies and legitimate pieces. I agree.
*  All right. So to recap. Ben Simmons was our first pick to was house took pool. I took Levine and Wiggins.
*  House took Beal. Was took Vucevich and Townes. House took Trey. I took Aitin and Kelter Johnson.
*  House took Jeremy Grant was to Kawhi and McCollum started to get spicy right around here. House asked
*  to take two picks a row and took Hunter and Collins together. I took Lamello and Lillard with the
*  Gilbang same game parlay. My Michael, Michael P. Jordan, AKA Michael Porter Jr. I have MPJ down.
*  I wrote it as MBJ for some reason. Michael Porter Jr. and Sabonis. What you got super spicy here in
*  the second half of this draft. I didn't really realize it until I was looking at it. House took
*  the Siakam extension that hasn't happened yet. I took Kim Johnson and Anthony Davis.
*  Kyle Kuzma went to house and the last pick was Tyler Herod. We have some apologies as always.
*  We'd like to offer apologies. Bruce Brown, two years, 45 millions, making 20 million next year
*  to be the ninth man on Toronto. Apologies. Kevin Herter, the Red Rocket, three for 50.5.
*  His stats dropped dramatically. Sorry to him. Grant Williams, 453, made it 50 games with the
*  team that signed him. He can't believe he doesn't know what else he had to do to get picked. Michael
*  Finley's taking Snipes at him in the media. There's drive-bys on him every day. PJ Tucker with the
*  two for 22.6 taking the leave of absence and everybody be like, all right, tell us where you
*  need to come back. He didn't get picked. Rob Williams, three for 37.2. Sorry to Rob.
*  Sorry to Draymond Green, four for a hundred. One more incident away from maybe just being suspended
*  for the rest of the season. I'm not sure I'd want to be on the hook with that. And then last but not
*  least, Davos Bertons, 16 million this year and a $5.5 million buyout just to get out of his $17
*  million extension. So you have to pay five and a half just to get him out. But he did not get
*  picked and it made me sad. This is the first time we've done the draft without Bertons. Maybe next
*  year somebody overpays him. All right, before we go, we got to bring in Saruti. Saruti, who won the
*  draft. Man, was super spicy. I think I love the hero pick. The bonus thing was just I especially
*  have to like triple doubles owning Anthony Davis. It's going to be a tough one, but I'm willing to
*  hear it as somebody who still thinks that trade is a disaster for the Kings. So I got a side with
*  laws. You know, obviously houses Homer, so there's no house. I give the slight edge to.
*  Was congratulations. You won the 2024 worst contract strap. I mean, he did have the first
*  pick, but when you when you start out with Ben Simmons, it's your team is loaded.
*  Yeah, you start out Ben Simmons, Vucevic, Towns. Wow.
