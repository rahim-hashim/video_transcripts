# The Grizzlies’ Future, the Devers Trade, and Kon Knueppel Stops By | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w)
*  Alright, taping this close to dinner time, Chris Burnett is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the fourth part of the week, or it's going to be, because I had another one Thursday night, but we were arguing on texts. We have other guys. There's just too much sports going on. It's like, fuck it. Let's just keep doing podcasts. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=29.84s)]
*  Burnett was scolding me about my opinions on the Desmond Bain trade because he's in Memphis. We're making front of house because he passed out on a golf course. What happened to you last week? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=41.12s)]
*  I didn't pass out on the golf course. It was the hottest day of the year here in the DMV, Washington, DC. And you add in the humidity and it was a long round. It was my little club here in the neck of the woods. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=52.84s)]
*  And we were out there and I was enjoying a couple of gentlemen's beverages as one might with his buddies, with his pals, and came off the golf course okay. I was tired and I had to do a shower and everything. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=65.84s)]
*  I drove myself home, no problem. I meet my family for dinner and I sit down and what do I do? Order another service, of course. Got to a Mexican restaurant and I'm eating my shrimp taco salad. And the next thing you know, I'm like, I feel a little lightheaded. I'm not feeling great right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=80.84s)]
*  You were going to have like a stroke or a heart attack? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=97.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. It was like a little fear, like a fainting spell, like a little spell. I was having a spell. And then I was like, I should get up and try and get some fresh air. Let me get up out of this chair. And I go like this. I'm on the video. The boys can see it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=99.84s)]
*  And I go like this and I'm back down. And then I look up and mama's like, bruh, we are calling an ambulance. Don't you move? Don't move. Because you close your eyes there for about 10 seconds. And I was like, I'm fine. I'm fine. Let me get up and walk home. Just help me get to the car. I'm fine. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=112.84s)]
*  I didn't really lose consciousness and I was lucid enough to have a conversation. And then they brought all the responders. They had to clear the poor people trying to have their burritos on the patio. It was a nice evening when the sun set. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=131.84s)]
*  And they thought this golfer was dropping dead in the course? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=146.84s)]
*  I was fine. It was fine. They hooked me up. But all I needed was the IV. They put me in the thing. They gave me some IV. I was like, oh, hey, can I go home now, please? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=149.84s)]
*  Soberno, is this drunk house? Dehydrated house? What version of house is this? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=158.84s)]
*  I have so many questions. So wait, is this at the restaurant? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=163.84s)]
*  At the restaurant. This was like two hours after I was done playing golf. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=167.84s)]
*  Is your kid with you? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=171.84s)]
*  Yeah, that was so he got upset. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=173.84s)]
*  Oh my god, he's tormenting your child. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=175.84s)]
*  This is, this is, this is trauma. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=178.84s)]
*  A man should be allowed to have a great time on the golf course. I will say this. I did start taking a medicine that has the effect of reducing liquid, you know, whatever, diuretic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=181.84s)]
*  And that is a natural dehydration thing. And I had worked out in the morning and I hadn't really hydrated from the workout. And then I went to play golf. And I didn't really, I would say I did the opposite of hydrate while I was playing golf. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=192.84s)]
*  Did you get admitted to the hospital? Like, were you mean by admitted? I mean, I went to the ER. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=206.84s)]
*  You did. You went to the ER. How long did it take you to get in? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=211.84s)]
*  I saw that nurse. I saw that nurse. How long? No time. I was on a thing. They rolled me right in. Yeah, because I was in it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=214.84s)]
*  So it sounds like I need to... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=224.84s)]
*  One IV here and one IV here. Yeah, I had a, but I was like, oh, they gave me eight bags. I was there for five hours. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=225.84s)]
*  Eight bags? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=232.84s)]
*  I saw the docs. I was like, what are my restrictions? What should I be worried about? You can go live your life, son. Go do your best thing. How about this? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=234.84s)]
*  Don't drink a whole bunch of vodka seltzers out on the golf course without mixing it in the water here and there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=243.84s)]
*  What did you shoot? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=249.84s)]
*  I actually played great. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=251.84s)]
*  It's such an advertisement. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=254.84s)]
*  It's my usual. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  Severe dehydration. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  My mid-80s kind of thing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  I was happy without my ball off the tee. Great tee ball all day long. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=260.84s)]
*  It does get crazy hot in the DMV, not the Defend House. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=264.84s)]
*  It was the humidity and I had not had anything to eat or drink over the course of the day. I'm a big dummy. What can I say? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=267.84s)]
*  It was really that medication that I didn't understand the impact of it. He's like, look, it's a new deal. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=273.84s)]
*  This is our PSA. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=278.84s)]
*  Electrolytes. I need electrolytes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=280.84s)]
*  PSA, Bill, don't mix pills and alcohol. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=283.84s)]
*  We all needed that PSA. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=287.84s)]
*  The pills were already part of the program. I didn't mix it. I just didn't understand the impact of it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=289.84s)]
*  I only been taking them for a couple of months. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=295.84s)]
*  It sounds like I need to get rid of parent corner and just add old corner. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=297.84s)]
*  Old man corner. They were not boner pills for the record. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=300.84s)]
*  Not that I'm against those. I'm just telling you that's not the pill that caused the problem. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=304.84s)]
*  In this instance. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=309.84s)]
*  When you come out here at the end of August, let's just get colonoscopies together. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=311.84s)]
*  Let's go full tail. Let's embrace our own. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=316.84s)]
*  I'll get another. I'm happy to get as many as you want. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=320.84s)]
*  If you haven't got yours yet, we'll do it. I'm happy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=323.84s)]
*  Well, Verno had his version of a colonoscopy in the form of they traded the third best player in the Grizzlies for four picks and a swap, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=325.84s)]
*  which is now defending as like the greatest. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=333.84s)]
*  This is like the new version of the Paul George Kawhi trade. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=336.84s)]
*  You're just not every ringer. No, I did not do that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=339.84s)]
*  What I did do was defend that this is if any other team makes this trade, everybody loves this trade. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=342.84s)]
*  That's the way this goes. Right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=351.84s)]
*  If you get that kind of value for a non all star player, everybody loves this trade, especially one, by the way, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=353.84s)]
*  a non all star player that's on a full on max two hundred million dollar contract who has four years left of that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=360.84s)]
*  Right. If that's not good enough for your team with what you have, then if I would have told anybody two weeks ago that that that they are going to trade [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=368.84s)]
*  Desmond Bain and that that's the level of return that they will get from Desmond Bain, nobody would have believed it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=383.84s)]
*  But then when it happens, it's like, wow, this is going to be great for Orlando, which I agree. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=389.84s)]
*  I think it's going to be great for Orlando. Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=395.84s)]
*  But if you are getting that Phoenix pick next year, you're getting the 16th pick in next Wednesday's draft, the 16th pick, which is not a bad pick. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=399.84s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=409.84s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of players. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=410.84s)]
*  Last year, 16th pick was Jared McCain two, three years ago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=413.84s)]
*  It was Alper and Shengun. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=418.84s)]
*  So just don't tell me that you can't get a good player with 16. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=420.84s)]
*  You got to hit it. You have to hit it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=422.84s)]
*  But that's not a bad. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=424.84s)]
*  That's a good range for the draft to be in next year's Phoenix pick. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=426.84s)]
*  Who knows what that can be? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=431.84s)]
*  Well, isn't that that's the that's the worst one of a Phoenix Washington swap. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=434.84s)]
*  Right. So it'll be the whatever is a little worse. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=438.84s)]
*  You get that one. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=441.84s)]
*  It'll be Phoenix's because Washington's is, I think, eight protected. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=442.84s)]
*  I think it's protected through eight. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=446.84s)]
*  But so it will be it will be Phoenix's pick. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=447.84s)]
*  OK. And who knows where they're going. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=450.84s)]
*  And then I understand what you're saying about like, well, and they're going to be good. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=452.84s)]
*  So those picks won't be good. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=457.84s)]
*  But all I would tell you is if there's anything we have learned in the NBA, it's that we never, ever know. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=459.84s)]
*  Two years ago, the Grizzlies won 56 games. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=467.84s)]
*  Then they won 51. Then they had a lottery pick where they took Zach Ede last year. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=470.84s)]
*  No one would have we never thought we were going to be having a lottery party ever again. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=475.84s)]
*  Right. And then it happens. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=480.84s)]
*  And to wit this year, this year, the number one pick in the draft is a team we watched a year ago in the NBA Finals. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=483.84s)]
*  The number three pick in the draft is the Philadelphia 76ers who got Paul George last offseason. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=492.84s)]
*  So all I would say is and look, I expect Orlando has got a great young core. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=501.84s)]
*  I think they should be very good. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=507.84s)]
*  But all I would tell you is you never know. And those assets are real. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=509.84s)]
*  And you use those assets. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=513.8399999999999s)]
*  If the Grizzlies don't take the assets that they just got from Desmond Bain and then their cap room and everything else they have and don't improve their roster greatly, then it's a failure. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=515.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. But this is, in my opinion, step one of what is going to be an offseason where they build out around John Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=529.84s)]
*  Now, if you want to argue that that's a stupid thing to do, that's fine. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=540.84s)]
*  I disagree with that. I think it's a smart thing to do because you put those guys with a myriad of different lineups in the past. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=544.84s)]
*  And every time they've won every time when they've been healthy, they have won. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=552.84s)]
*  And in fact, they were two games separated from being the three seed this year. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=557.84s)]
*  So what if Memphis would have been the three seed this year? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=563.84s)]
*  Then what? Then would people be talking about possibly? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=567.84s)]
*  Oh, is this blowing it up? Oh, they shouldn't build around these guys. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=570.84s)]
*  Oh, like two games. And by the way, from February 15th on, the season went to absolute hell and they fired their coach. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=574.84s)]
*  Right. True. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=583.84s)]
*  So, I mean, I would just say. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=584.84s)]
*  And the other thing is Desmond Bain has gotten more love in the last three days that Desmond Bain has gotten in five years. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=586.84s)]
*  Five years. I've been watching him every night rooting for him every night. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=594.84s)]
*  I love Desmond Bain. But people have talked about Desmond Bain more in a loving and glowing way since he got traded from Memphis than they ever did when he was playing in Memphis. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=599.84s)]
*  And the reason I attacked you is because you and Ryan were having your little Memphis hatred party that you guys have. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=611.84s)]
*  And he hates he hate he he you don't like Jared. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=621.84s)]
*  He doesn't like Jav and Desmond Bain suddenly became a guy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=626.84s)]
*  You said I was just at the NBA Finals and I watched Desmond or I watched those games and Desmond Bain's the kind of guy that can play 35 minutes in that game. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=631.84s)]
*  I stand by it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=640.84s)]
*  We played Oklahoma City. We played them like that happened. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=641.84s)]
*  We did play them and he was 20 for 72 and two and seven for 32 from three and couldn't dribble against any of them. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=646.84s)]
*  So we played that team, the team that's like the mountain, like the one that you have to climb in as we think in the Western Conference. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=656.84s)]
*  Like we played them and he was I mean he was pitiful. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=665.84s)]
*  He passed out in a Mexican restaurant like house. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=670.84s)]
*  He passed out in a Mexican restaurant. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=673.84s)]
*  This episode is presented by State Farm. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=675.84s)]

*  Well, I would just remind you that Jaren Jackson was also horrendous in that series. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=705.84s)]
*  It shot 37 percent at 20 rebounds total in four games. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=710.84s)]
*  So if we're going to I think everybody looks bad against OKC. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=713.84s)]
*  That's not how I judge my personal moves. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=717.84s)]
*  House, what was your take when you heard about the trade? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=719.84s)]
*  I loved it for Orlando, obviously. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=722.84s)]
*  And I think that is the main reason for why the glow up of Bain is occurring. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=726.84s)]
*  It's like in this context where it's like, oh, wow, that's a perfect fit for Orlando. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=732.84s)]
*  This guy is going to fit in seamlessly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=737.84s)]
*  And, you know, it's all the positive aspects of Bain. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=740.84s)]
*  And so I think, Berno, that's that's the love that you're seeing. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=744.84s)]
*  It's like, put him in that context. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=747.84s)]
*  OK, we get it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=749.84s)]
*  But I was watching one of those dreadful Fox shows in the morning and they had a guy on there and he's like, oh, Bain, it's a perfect 3 and D guy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=750.84s)]
*  And now this gives Orlando one of the best defensive backcourt. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=762.84s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=765.84s)]
*  I think saying you got it, CJ McCollum and you write like that was the Memphis problem. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=767.84s)]
*  Right. Is that you had you basically had the New Age version of Lillard and McCollum where you have two diminutive guards, both outstanding players. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=774.84s)]
*  Right. But it's really hard to build like to unless you are and especially when they all start getting paid, like every team's going to go through this where it's like where it's time to pay up for the guys. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=783.84s)]
*  And it's like, man, those three have to be good enough or else because you're not going to have good enough players on the rest of the roster. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=796.84s)]
*  Like you have to hit everything. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=804.84s)]
*  Right. Well, that's why I like it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=805.84s)]
*  But I like it for Memphis because, yes, it creates the flexibility to do triple J in a long term kind of deal and lock him down. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=808.84s)]
*  I'm a triple J fan. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=818.84s)]
*  You didn't rebound when you played pickup. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=821.84s)]
*  Also, Bill, he is he's been a defensive player of the year. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=823.84s)]
*  But also, thank you to you. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=827.84s)]
*  No, thank you to you and all of your voting brethren. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=830.84s)]
*  You just enabled Memphis to be able to really build out a roster. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=835.84s)]
*  Because he didn't get the OMBA. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=839.84s)]
*  It's two hundred million dollars difference. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=841.84s)]
*  Literally two hundred million dollars. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=844.84s)]
*  That's amazing. That's amazing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=847.84s)]
*  He was he would have been eligible for a five year three hundred and forty five million dollar contract. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=849.84s)]
*  Wow. If he would have made third team OMBA, I think he missed it by one vote. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=858.84s)]
*  So thank you to you. Thank you to you. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=862.84s)]
*  Is that true? This is like when you look at all this stuff, I don't want to know any of this. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=865.84s)]
*  I know. I don't want to know what the implications are. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=870.84s)]
*  I want that power. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=873.84s)]
*  He he now like they can renegotiate this next year. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=874.84s)]
*  He's on the books for twenty three. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=878.84s)]
*  They can renegotiate that year. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=879.84s)]
*  But now instead of his eligible extension now becomes four years, one hundred and forty seven million instead of five years, three hundred and forty five million. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=881.84s)]
*  That's pretty big. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=893.84s)]
*  And so obviously, obviously, if I'm paying him four years, one forty seven, I feel great about that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=894.84s)]
*  If I'm paying him five years, three hundred, I don't feel great about that at all. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=901.84s)]
*  House. That's a good deal. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=904.84s)]
*  And here's the aspect of it that I like for Memphis. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=906.84s)]
*  Jalen Wells is a dude. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=909.84s)]
*  And what Desmond Bain moving on means is we're going to see a lot of Jalen Wells. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=911.84s)]
*  Like I think his come up is going to like the replacement level that he's going to be able to put on the table. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=915.84s)]
*  And they are guaranteed a lottery pick. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=922.84s)]
*  So it's a trade in my estimation where you're freeing up Jalen Wells to become the player that he can become. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=923.84s)]
*  And you have a guaranteed lottery pick all those other picks. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=930.84s)]
*  That's like currency for more deals that climate is going to be willing to deal in as as he as he does. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=933.84s)]
*  But really, here's why the trade makes sense for Memphis lottery pick next year. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=939.84s)]
*  Jalen Wells, you know, with a more prominent role, that's why it makes sense to me. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=943.84s)]
*  They also are going to go get that wing. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=948.84s)]
*  You know that that has been their search, right? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=950.84s)]
*  They tried to get OG and Inobi. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=953.84s)]
*  They tried to get McKell Bridges. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=955.84s)]
*  They tried to get last year. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=957.84s)]
*  They literally were at the finish line with Dorian Finney Smith, who would have been amazing for their. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=960.84s)]
*  And of course, Brooklyn leaks the trade, which was canard and con char and a pick and then gets a better deal from the Lakers. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=967.84s)]
*  Right. So they leaked out the trade that was already set that that was ready to go down and then canvassed the area and got what they thought was a better deal from the Lakers. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=979.84s)]
*  OK, so if we're following this right, whether it was McKell Bridges, whether it was OG and Inobi, they obviously, you know, kick the tires on Jimmy Butler and Jimmy Butler went to literally anybody that had an opportunity to say, I don't want to go to Memphis and said that on air, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=990.84s)]
*  whether it was Mark Spears, whether it was on and on. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1007.84s)]
*  Right. They kick the tires on Durant. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1010.84s)]
*  Right. And that couldn't happen last year. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1012.84s)]
*  Like they made an offer for so you know that they look at it and they go, we have John Morant, we have Jared Jackson Jr. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1015.84s)]
*  We need a wing player to go along with. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1021.84s)]
*  Can they trade back for Desmond Bayne? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1026.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. Stop. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1028.8400000000001s)]
*  They need a wing like Desmond Bayne, it sounds like. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1030.8400000000001s)]
*  Six five guys, 40 percent three point shooter, 20 a game and five is a game. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1033.84s)]
*  OK, well, if we still had Desmond Bayne, you'd have the under for the Grizzlies next year. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1038.84s)]
*  So you didn't think it was good enough. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1043.84s)]
*  We don't think it was good enough. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1045.84s)]
*  40 to 50 games a year. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1046.84s)]
*  That's why I would have the under. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1047.84s)]
*  Your best guy doesn't play. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1049.84s)]
*  I mean, he played 50 this past year and then you want to go through his game. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1050.84s)]
*  I got it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1055.84s)]
*  I got it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1056.84s)]
*  We know. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1057.84s)]
*  We know. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1059.84s)]
*  Two thousand twenty two fifty seven, two thousand twenty three, sixty one, two thousand twenty four, nine, two thousand twenty five, fifty. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1060.84s)]
*  Hey, hold on. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1068.84s)]
*  Your best guy doesn't play. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1069.84s)]
*  No, no. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1070.84s)]
*  Sixty one would have been a lot more if you wouldn't have gotten suspended for. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1071.84s)]
*  I mean, that was he's never played 68 games in a season. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1074.84s)]
*  He's been in the league six fucking years. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1079.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1081.84s)]
*  Like at some point you are who you are. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1082.84s)]
*  But when he does. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1084.84s)]
*  This is what I would argue. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1085.84s)]
*  When he does, he is absolutely awesome and they win. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1087.84s)]
*  This is not Lamello. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1092.84s)]
*  This is not Zion. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1094.84s)]
*  This is not other guys that get thrown in that same mix. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1095.84s)]
*  When he plays, they win at an extremely high rate and he performs at an insanely high level. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1099.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1109.84s)]
*  Would you house are you worried about either of these numbers? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1110.84s)]
*  Three point shooting the last three years for him. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1112.84s)]
*  Thirty point seven, twenty seven point five, thirty point nine free throw attempts by year eight point one, seven point one, six point four. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1115.84s)]
*  So I have somebody getting less to the line who still can't shoot threes, who any good defense knows that he's just going to go fly into the rim and do the thing where he jumps in the air and double clutches. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1124.84s)]
*  Like I just haven't seen him improve as an offensive player. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1135.84s)]
*  Now, I understand the success rate thing. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1138.84s)]
*  But if you're telling me you're building around a star score who doesn't play all the time and a star big man who does rebound, I just don't know what your ceiling is. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1140.84s)]
*  House, you'd be the time maker. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1150.84s)]
*  Then how are they good? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1152.84s)]
*  Just tell me how are they? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1154.84s)]
*  How were they good? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1155.84s)]
*  You tell me you were there. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1156.84s)]
*  No, they were 40 games. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1158.84s)]
*  Thirty four last year. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1160.84s)]
*  So how they don't have any good players. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1161.84s)]
*  They don't have anybody that anybody likes except the bait who just got traded. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1164.84s)]
*  Evidently, everybody loves Desmond Payne now. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1169.84s)]
*  It is crazy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1171.84s)]
*  The reason that they are good is because they ran a great offense. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1172.84s)]
*  They are a tremendous three point shooting team with a bunch of guys that nobody's heard of. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1176.84s)]
*  Good depth too. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1181.84s)]
*  At every position. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1182.84s)]
*  They don't really have good depth. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1184.84s)]
*  But they bring in Scottie Pippen and Canard and Contra. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1185.84s)]
*  They started two rookies. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1189.84s)]
*  Like last year. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1193.84s)]
*  But last year they won 48 games. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1194.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1197.84s)]
*  They won 48 games. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1198.84s)]
*  They John Morant played 50 games. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1199.84s)]
*  They got literally zero, zero, less than zero out of Marcus Smart. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1201.84s)]
*  Negative return on the smart deal. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1206.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1208.84s)]
*  That was a bad deal that they paid for. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1209.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1211.84s)]
*  And they started the 39th pick and the ninth pick in a by all accounts horrendous draft. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1212.84s)]
*  And somehow won 48 games. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1220.84s)]
*  So somebody is good is what I'm saying. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1223.84s)]
*  Somebody's good. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1226.84s)]
*  You know who else is good? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1227.84s)]
*  Taylor Jenkins. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1228.84s)]
*  You want him to be the Knicks coach? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1229.84s)]
*  No, that was another one. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1232.84s)]
*  Every time somebody leaves down, Vernaut is kicking them hard in the butt on their way out. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1234.84s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1238.84s)]
*  I love these guys. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1239.84s)]
*  I love Taylor Jenkins. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1240.84s)]
*  I love Desmond Baines. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1242.84s)]
*  So why did you fire him? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1243.84s)]
*  You just told me you were overachieved. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1244.84s)]
*  Because here's the deal with Taylor Jenkins. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1246.84s)]
*  Once I don't understand what all took place, but like they brought in. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1249.84s)]
*  They brought in a bunch of like. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1253.84s)]
*  After the last season, they brought in a bunch of assistant coaches. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1256.84s)]
*  They installed this new offense. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1260.84s)]
*  John Moran hated it. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1262.84s)]
*  Desmond Baines hated it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1264.84s)]
*  Like, interestingly enough, like it did not accentuate the talents of these guys. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1266.84s)]
*  So, I mean, they could have won even more. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1271.84s)]
*  And then you the defense went to absolute hell and you never beat anybody good. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1273.84s)]
*  All of those 48 wins were generally against bad teams under 500 teams. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1281.84s)]
*  Or somebody's best guy was hurt that time they played them. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1287.84s)]
*  And then your second part of your schedule, right? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1291.84s)]
*  The second part of the schedule, it got hard and they were losing all the time. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1294.84s)]
*  And they went from the two seed all the way down to the play in, right? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1298.84s)]
*  Where they're at the eight seed. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1301.84s)]
*  And you guys know as well as I do, right? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1303.84s)]
*  The players aren't going to get blamed, right? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1305.84s)]
*  And now, I mean, look, obviously there is at least they're making a move. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1308.84s)]
*  And they're saying it's not good enough roster wise, right? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1312.84s)]
*  They admit it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1316.84s)]
*  But this is where I push back. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1317.84s)]
*  And we can let House be the tiebreaker. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1319.84s)]
*  I'm good with the Desmond Baines trade if you keep going now. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1322.84s)]
*  And you just completely blow it up. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1326.84s)]
*  Which is what you said you don't want to do. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1328.84s)]
*  Blow it up? For what? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1330.84s)]
*  I would. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1332.84s)]
*  For what? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1333.84s)]
*  What are you doing now? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1334.84s)]
*  Where are you going to the West? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1335.84s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1336.84s)]
*  Where? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1337.84s)]
*  What planet am I on where blowing it up is a smart way to build your basketball team right now? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1338.84s)]
*  We just got done talking about the number one pick. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1344.84s)]
*  Cooper Flagg is going to play in Dallas. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1347.84s)]
*  And Dylan Harper is going to play in San Antonio. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1349.84s)]
*  And Ace Bailey or Kahn Kanepel or whoever is going to be playing in Philadelphia. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1352.84s)]
*  OK? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1357.84s)]
*  Ask Utah how good it is to blow it up. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1358.84s)]
*  Ask New Orleans how good it is. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1363.84s)]
*  To blow it up. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1365.84s)]
*  Hey, do you think Utah is in a good spot right now, Bill? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1366.84s)]
*  Do you think Memphis is in a good spot right now? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1369.84s)]
*  They were just two games away from the three seed. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1371.84s)]
*  They're not 20 games away. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1376.84s)]
*  They're two. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1379.84s)]
*  House, what do you think the finals odds are for Memphis on Fanduil for next year to win the title? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1381.84s)]
*  Too low. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1386.84s)]
*  To win the title? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1388.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1390.84s)]
*  60 to one. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1391.84s)]
*  65 to one. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1392.84s)]
*  110 to one on Fanduil. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1393.84s)]
*  That's disrespectful. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1396.84s)]
*  It's like we're two moves away. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1398.84s)]
*  I hope we trade for Jalen Brown. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1400.84s)]
*  I really do. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1402.84s)]
*  That would just send you into an absolute tizzy. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1403.84s)]
*  What's the trade? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1406.84s)]
*  Make us an offer. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1407.84s)]
*  We will. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1408.84s)]
*  We might. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1409.84s)]
*  You never know. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1410.84s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1411.84s)]
*  If you're telling me you're going to take all these assets plus Gigi Jackson and some of these dudes you have, some stealth assets, and you go all in on somebody, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1412.84s)]
*  it might make more sense to me. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1421.84s)]
*  But House, you still haven't really weighed in on whether you would want to build around Ja Morant after what we've seen the last three, four years. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1423.84s)]
*  It's not just Ja though. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1430.84s)]
*  It's Ja and Triple J. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1432.84s)]
*  It has to be a package deal because you're not going to get 60 games out of Ja. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1433.84s)]
*  You're just not. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1437.84s)]
*  And the thing, it better be a point of emphasis. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1438.84s)]
*  We better see him shoot the three with some improved efficiency this upcoming season. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1440.84s)]
*  Having said all of that, like if you sit down and look at the Grizzlies offensive numbers, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1446.84s)]
*  from last year, it's incredible. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1450.84s)]
*  They had the second, they were number two in scoring offense. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1451.84s)]
*  They were in the top three in offensive rebounds. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1455.84s)]
*  They were in the top 10 or 11 in three points. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1458.84s)]
*  Like they were, it was a bad ass offense. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1460.84s)]
*  And you look at that roster and say, well, where was that coming from? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1462.84s)]
*  Who was doing all of that scoring? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1466.84s)]
*  Ja only played 50 games. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1469.84s)]
*  Well, it's all these dudes that, you know, Verdo can rattle off that are, that are effective. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1471.84s)]
*  And they had that offense. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1476.84s)]
*  That maybe there was this tension in the, in the coaching room between, you know, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1478.84s)]
*  the scheme and what the players wanted to play. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1482.84s)]
*  But the proof is in the pudding. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1484.84s)]
*  Like they, their, their problem was, was exactly what Verdo said. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1486.84s)]
*  They didn't play any defense from February until the end of the season. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1489.84s)]
*  No defense whatsoever. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1492.84s)]
*  You think Bain's defense overrated, properly rated, underrated? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1493.84s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1497.84s)]
*  It's not even rated. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1498.84s)]
*  He's not a, he's not a defensive stalwart. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1499.84s)]
*  I mean, he's another guy. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1501.84s)]
*  He's much like, uh, T.V. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1503.84s)]
*  I mean, you see what Jayla Williams did to is doing to knee Smith right now. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1505.84s)]
*  A guy that we liked. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1508.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1509.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1510.84s)]
*  The guy that looked good as a big time athlete with size and length against like Jalen Brunson. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1511.84s)]
*  He's in a world of shit right now. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1517.84s)]
*  I mean, they are just finding him constantly. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1519.84s)]
*  And so he's not that level of defender. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1522.84s)]
*  And so again, he's, that's not, he is, he's not that level of defender. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1525.84s)]
*  He's not that level of defender. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1529.84s)]
*  He's not that level of defender. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1531.84s)]
*  He is. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1533.84s)]
*  He I, Desmond Bain can be. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1534.84s)]
*  I don't want to go too far on this. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1538.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1541.84s)]
*  But there's going to be a world where Steph Curry is no longer in the league and Desmond [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1542.84s)]
*  Bain's right there at the very top of the best shooters in the league list. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1548.84s)]
*  That's true. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1552.84s)]
*  He is a great, like not good, great shooter. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1553.84s)]
*  Great. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1559.84s)]
*  And Orlando needed. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1560.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1562.84s)]
*  Just roll in it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1563.84s)]
*  Now they do need something. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1564.84s)]
*  You know, if they, if they could generate the look for him, you know, he is, I don't [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1565.84s)]
*  want him doing a ton of dribbling. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1571.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1574.84s)]
*  I want him to be able to play shooting guard and he ran a lot of Chris Lee's offense last [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1575.84s)]
*  year. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1579.84s)]
*  And, you know, he, it's kind of like when you guys would watch Jalen Brown, right. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1580.84s)]
*  The less dribbling, the better. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1584.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1586.84s)]
*  Like I don't want. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1587.84s)]
*  And so I want him playing shooting guard. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1588.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1590.84s)]
*  And I, I don't want him playing point guard. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1591.84s)]
*  I don't want him handling the ball on, at a high level. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1594.84s)]
*  How's you guys talked about this on ringer gambling show about the Orlando title odds [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1599.84s)]
*  for next year, which probably are not the time to do it. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1604.84s)]
*  You want to wait for other people in the East to make moves and then do it. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1608.84s)]
*  And I don't think they're going to make the finals next year, but I also don't know what [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1612.84s)]
*  the F's can happen in the East. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1615.84s)]
*  You know, like I had Doc Rivers on last night. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1617.84s)]
*  If I have Giannis on my team, I don't even care who else is on the team. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1619.84s)]
*  I'm like, I have a puncher's chance. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1622.84s)]
*  Who the fuck knows? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1624.84s)]
*  Um, do you think Orlando, what, what, what's left for them to do? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1625.84s)]
*  How about win a playoff series once? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1629.84s)]
*  Well, that would help. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1632.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1633.84s)]
*  Cause I mean, before we talk about finals, but I do think if they hadn't had all the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1634.84s)]
*  injuries last year, I do think there's a world where they won 50 plus games and would have [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1639.84s)]
*  been an absolute bitch in the playoffs. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1644.84s)]
*  I don't know if that, how many rounds they would have won, but they had the year from [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1646.84s)]
*  hell last year and they, Suggs was a huge part of what they did. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1649.84s)]
*  I agree. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1652.84s)]
*  You know, and they had every oblique injury. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1653.84s)]
*  They're two guys, both had the same injuries. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1656.84s)]
*  Like that was nuts how that played out. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1658.84s)]
*  So, you know, I think that a healthy version of that team, Indiana is like, Jesus, they're [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1660.84s)]
*  like going to be walking dead by the end of this finals with the amount of playoff games [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1666.84s)]
*  they've played, playing a hundred plus game season at this pace. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1670.84s)]
*  So you will say, the reason they were extremely good, right? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1674.84s)]
*  They, I heard Zach Lowe saying with Goldsberry that clip that they haven't had a top 20 offense [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1678.84s)]
*  in 13 years. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1686.84s)]
*  I mean, that was the most shocking stat I think I've ever heard in my life. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1687.84s)]
*  Like how? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1691.84s)]
*  Top 20? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1692.84s)]
*  There's only 30 teams in the league, right? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1693.84s)]
*  So they have an, so they did it by defense, right? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1696.84s)]
*  They were a great, like sensational defensive team. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1699.84s)]
*  And obviously a huge part of that is, and Suggs went out was Katavius Caldwell-Pope, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1703.84s)]
*  who you've already put in the grave. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1710.84s)]
*  Cause I heard you guys acted like that was a total non-asset. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1712.84s)]
*  No, listen, you have to face the facts of this. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1717.84s)]
*  You got four picks and a swap for Bain. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1720.84s)]
*  One of those picks was to take Caldwell-Pope's contract away from Orlando because it was [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1722.84s)]
*  a sunk cost for them. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1728.84s)]
*  Cause that's how bad it was. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1729.84s)]
*  And you can ask any Orlando fan who had to watch them last year, that was like the lightning [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1730.84s)]
*  rod for the whole season was how bad he was. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1735.84s)]
*  Now I don't know if he's going to be bad again. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1738.84s)]
*  Can we agree as a horrendous team to be a corner three specialist on? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1740.84s)]
*  Like it's a world of difference. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1745.84s)]
*  This guy went from winning a title with LeBron and winning a title with Jokic to a team that [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1746.84s)]
*  does, creates no open shots for anybody. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1751.84s)]
*  Or you could say he was playing with LeBron and Jokic and that's why he looked as good [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1753.84s)]
*  as maybe he did as a role player. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1757.84s)]
*  Now you take them away from that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1759.84s)]
*  And now he's playing with John Morant who generates more corner threes than anybody. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1760.84s)]
*  And more DMPs. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1765.84s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1767.84s)]
*  Put him up against Zion. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1771.84s)]
*  What's it like to go to work? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1774.84s)]
*  And is that like the first question you ask after you say to everybody, Hey, how are you? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1775.84s)]
*  Is job playing? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1779.84s)]
*  Is that the second question? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1781.84s)]
*  It is annoying. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1782.84s)]
*  There's no way around it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1783.84s)]
*  Is job playing? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1784.84s)]
*  No, he's playing. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1785.84s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1786.84s)]
*  There's going to come a day where it all comes together and he's healthy. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1787.84s)]
*  I know it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1790.84s)]
*  I know it. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1791.84s)]
*  Well, when guys hit their late 20s, sometimes that happens. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1792.84s)]
*  We got to take one break and then we're going to keep going. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1794.84s)]
*  Hey, both of you love golf. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1796.84s)]
*  We do. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1799.84s)]
*  The US Open just came and went. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1800.84s)]
*  And the most exciting part of it for casual fans like us was when they showed the 2008 [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1802.84s)]
*  US Open in Tiger Woods and Rocko Mediate. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1807.84s)]
*  I was fucking riveted. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1809.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1811.84s)]
*  Just, I mean, the perfect storm, literally bad weather, um, a really hard course house. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1812.84s)]
*  You talked about it on fairway Roland and we end up with just an absolute, uh, bizarre [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1818.84s)]
*  carnage, just the way it plays out. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1825.84s)]
*  This is the second most important golf tournament of the year and nobody is, you know, there's [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1827.84s)]
*  just no conversation about it after. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1832.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1834.84s)]
*  Is this just an aberration or a house? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1835.84s)]
*  Is this a bad sign for golf? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1836.84s)]
*  What is this? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1839.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1840.84s)]
*  This is, you know, um, it is partly the effect of that golf course, that venue where, you [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1841.84s)]
*  know, it's, it's easy for the USGA, the governing body that's responsible for the US Open to [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1849.84s)]
*  set a goal of par as being the outcome, right? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1855.84s)]
*  Which I kind of enjoy. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1860.84s)]
*  I don't mind that like minus three is going to be the best score in four days basically. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1862.84s)]
*  The way the weather, um, kind of interrupted things and the impact of the weather over [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1868.84s)]
*  the course of, of the four days, it did have, you know, they're playing out of the rough. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1873.84s)]
*  They turned out to be wet rough. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1878.84s)]
*  There was water on the golf course for the last round. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1880.84s)]
*  It introduced some uncertainty where some guys were going to get lucky breaks and some [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1883.84s)]
*  guys were going to get unlucky breaks. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1887.84s)]
*  And so that's how you get a leaderboard where folks haven't heard of a lot of the players. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1889.84s)]
*  And then, you know, we, the whole thing was saved by the last, you know, five holes because [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1893.84s)]
*  JJ Spahn went out and won the golf tournament. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1898.84s)]
*  He birdied the last two holes and he played the back nine and two under par. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1900.84s)]
*  He went out and shot, uh, uh, no, he shot three under par on the back nine. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1904.84s)]
*  He went 40 on the front and 32 on the back, um, to win the US Open. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1908.84s)]
*  That's, that's pretty damn good. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1912.84s)]
*  And he's, he's like your classic kind of grinder guy. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1914.84s)]
*  So very relatable. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1917.84s)]
*  All the stories that have come out afterwards. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1918.84s)]
*  Awesome, dude. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1920.84s)]
*  Um, I'm, she's doing a great job on the interview circuit now, but we were deprived of like [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1921.84s)]
*  the, the, the very best guys in the world coming down the stretch in the hunt. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1926.84s)]
*  And I think that's the big complaint. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1931.84s)]
*  Which we had on Thursday when we had all those names and it was like, oh, here we go. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1932.84s)]
*  It's all a reflection. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1936.84s)]
*  Verno had an exciting moment with his dad though. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1937.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, it's all a reflection of who won it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1939.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1941.84s)]
*  People just don't know JJ Spahn. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1942.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1943.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1944.84s)]
*  This happened a few years ago. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1945.84s)]
*  So I worked that, uh, the US Open, uh, the year it was at LACC. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1946.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1953.84s)]
*  Windham Clark won and it was like, okay. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1954.84s)]
*  Everybody was hoping Rory was going to take it down at the end of that. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1957.84s)]
*  It was right there. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1961.84s)]
*  And it didn't happen. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1962.84s)]
*  And so because Windham Clark's not exactly a household name or anything at that time, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1963.84s)]
*  it was kind of the same kind of deal with this JJ Spahn thing. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1967.84s)]
*  It's like a cool story, but it appeals to the niche golf audience and not some huge audience. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1970.84s)]
*  That being said, my poor dad, my dad, this is on father's day, no less. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1975.84s)]
*  My dad calls me on Sunday afternoon and I answered the phone and he rarely will call [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1981.84s)]
*  because he can't figure out how to use his cell phone. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1989.84s)]
*  And I have to go to that. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1992.84s)]
*  And usually it's like, can you come fix my mouse? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1994.84s)]
*  Can you plug in my HDMI? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1997.84s)]
*  I forgot my spectrum password. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=1999.84s)]
*  I can't change the inputs. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2001.84s)]
*  What's going on with this thing? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2003.84s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2005.84s)]
*  And so my parents live very close to me. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2006.84s)]
*  And so I said, I said, hey, man, happy father's day. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2009.84s)]
*  And he was like, oh, yeah. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2012.84s)]
*  Happy, happy father's day to you, too. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2015.84s)]
*  I swear to God, I think he had no idea it was father's day. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2017.84s)]
*  None. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2021.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2022.84s)]
*  And he's like, hey, I just, I just had a question. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2023.84s)]
*  He's like, so I was watching the US Open and like Tiger was about to go to a [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2027.84s)]
*  playoff. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2032.84s)]
*  It looked like, and then like now it's like this guy burned to whatever. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2033.84s)]
*  He's like, is it the same? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2039.84s)]
*  And I was like, dad, no, I was like, I was like, dad, what you're watching [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2040.84s)]
*  right now, he's like, this is like live right now. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2045.84s)]
*  And I was like, yes. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2048.84s)]
*  And I was like, dad, did it never dawn on you at all that you were watching a [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2049.84s)]
*  30 year old Tiger Woods? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2055.84s)]
*  Like how could you possibly thought you were watching something live? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2057.84s)]
*  He was so into Tiger Woods versus what? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2063.84s)]
*  Rocko Mediate? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2066.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2067.84s)]
*  It was an amazing tournament. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2068.84s)]
*  Number one, it was at Torrey Pines in San Diego. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2069.84s)]
*  Number two, Tiger's like 30 and wearing a sweater vest and Nike stuff. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2074.84s)]
*  And it's clearly young Tiger Woods. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2079.84s)]
*  And no, my dad, I think my dad was disappointed that he was watching Sam [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2083.84s)]
*  Burns at the end of the US Open. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2088.84s)]
*  I think he should have told him it was Tiger Woods and Tiger Woods won the US [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2091.84s)]
*  Open. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2095.84s)]
*  He found out five days later, dude, I told this story on my local show and [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2096.84s)]
*  people were sending me all this shit that I should have my dad go back and [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2101.84s)]
*  watch. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2105.84s)]
*  He's going to love it. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2106.84s)]
*  He's going to wait till he sees the 86 World Series. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2109.84s)]
*  Like all this shit. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2113.84s)]
*  You know, he should show Gantz or John Morant plays 35 minutes. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2114.84s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2117.84s)]
*  We're supposed to enjoy this whole season. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2119.84s)]
*  How do you think they, they intentionally don't like put a glaring 2008 US Open [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2123.84s)]
*  when they show those because of people like this older audience that might [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2130.84s)]
*  actually think Tiger Woods is contending. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2134.84s)]
*  It's got to be intentional, right? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2136.84s)]
*  They definitely knew they had the forecast. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2138.84s)]
*  They knew that might be bad weather. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2141.84s)]
*  They teed up the 2008 US Open. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2143.84s)]
*  I mean, it was some criticism because why would they show Oakmont like an [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2145.84s)]
*  older version of Oakmont or something? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2150.84s)]
*  Why wouldn't they do that? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2152.84s)]
*  Why would they couldn't show 2016 because they fucked up the ruling with [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2153.84s)]
*  Dustin Johnson and paralyzed him a stroke. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2157.84s)]
*  And then the broadcast, the guys on the broadcast were trying to criticize [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2160.84s)]
*  the USGA so they weren't going to put that one on, but they could have put [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2165.84s)]
*  2007 on because that was Phil and Tiger both chasing after Angel Cabrera. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2169.84s)]
*  Now, Angel Cabrera, maybe not the most sympathetic character. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2174.84s)]
*  Maybe not that, maybe not. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2177.84s)]
*  But 2008 Tiger, I mean, that that thing shows you what a US Open is supposed to [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2179.84s)]
*  look like and feel like. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2185.84s)]
*  I mean, the crowd is sitting on top of the green. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2186.84s)]
*  That's part of the problem with Oakmont. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2189.84s)]
*  People were not like close enough. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2191.84s)]
*  It wasn't your giant roars. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2193.84s)]
*  That Tiger thing, people were losing their fucking minds over the really bad thing. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2195.84s)]
*  But also they did clear it out. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2200.84s)]
*  They cleared it out for the lightning and the rain and whatever. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2202.84s)]
*  But not over the four days we didn't have any. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2205.84s)]
*  I mean, that makes me think though, watching Tiger and just being so nostalgic [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2208.84s)]
*  for those 12 years when from 97 to 08 basically. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2212.84s)]
*  And, you know, like in basketball, we have to have this stupid face of the league [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2216.84s)]
*  conversation all the time now. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2220.84s)]
*  And it's just like these people are comets that pass through, right? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2222.84s)]
*  In the last 30 years in the NBA, I thought Magic's point about if you could sell out [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2226.84s)]
*  the other team's stadium, that's usually a good sign of whether you're at the [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2231.84s)]
*  right level. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2235.84s)]
*  Tiger could sell out any golf course. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2236.84s)]
*  MJ could sell out any stadium. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2238.84s)]
*  Kobe and Shaq together could sell out any stadium. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2240.84s)]
*  Kobe by himself in the late 2000s. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2242.84s)]
*  LeBron on Miami and Cleveland the second time he was there. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2245.84s)]
*  And then Curry when he showed up at 14. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2248.84s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2251.84s)]
*  We haven't had anybody since and it's OK. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2252.84s)]
*  I would tell you right now and I'm actually a relatively good person to probably talk [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2254.84s)]
*  about this is somebody who goes to every single home game in a small market. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2259.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2264.84s)]
*  The current LeBron are the only two. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2265.84s)]
*  It is true. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2267.84s)]
*  If you go to those games, you will see thousands of Curry jerseys and thousands of [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2269.84s)]
*  LeBron jerseys in any city in the country. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2275.84s)]
*  But it's not an argument. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2279.84s)]
*  The only way it changes is somebody would have to win like three, four straight [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2281.84s)]
*  titles in a row. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2285.84s)]
*  And even then, I don't know if it's gonna happen. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2286.84s)]
*  But when Benyama is the next guy who I think could potentially sell out stadiums, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2288.84s)]
*  if he just is like, you know, he's averaging 25, 15, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2292.84s)]
*  15, eight blocks a game like it's stuff we've never seen. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2298.84s)]
*  But when the Curry thing was such a phenomenon, like I don't know. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2302.84s)]
*  But the Tiger thing made me think of that because as much as the Shambles been fun, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2306.84s)]
*  right, Shephers is at the highest level of just being competitive in every tournament [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2311.84s)]
*  as anyone in a while. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2315.84s)]
*  Brooks Koepka was fun. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2317.84s)]
*  People love Rory. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2318.84s)]
*  But the Tiger thing was just different. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2320.84s)]
*  And it's just the reality of the situation. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2322.84s)]
*  I mean, House, we were there for the Masters. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2324.84s)]
*  People love Rory. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2326.84s)]
*  That Tiger. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2327.84s)]
*  No. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2328.84s)]
*  The Tiger thing went to a whole other level. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2329.84s)]
*  And you could feel it in the 08 Open. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2331.84s)]
*  It was just, I thought it was really interesting to rewatch. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2333.84s)]
*  That's every individual sport have to have dominant characters that have unbelievable charisma. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2335.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2343.84s)]
*  Or else because we get, because otherwise, like Scotty Shephler, like we know, you know, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2344.84s)]
*  whether it was, you know, even Joker now in tennis or it was Pete Sampras in tennis. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2351.84s)]
*  Or Tim Duncan in the 2000s. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2358.84s)]
*  Yeah, or it was Tim Duncan. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2360.84s)]
*  But the individual or like in boxing where it was Tyson, whatever, the same kind of thing as a Comet, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2362.84s)]
*  where it's like these individual sports are even more in need of that guy. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2369.84s)]
*  Not only do you have to be awesome, you also have to have like this charisma about you. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2375.84s)]
*  And that's what gets everybody like all involved. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2382.84s)]
*  Even Usain Bolt, right? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2386.84s)]
*  If Usain Bolt wasn't doing the bye bye and waving everything. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2388.84s)]
*  But all of a sudden people started caring about sprinting. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2391.84s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2395.84s)]
*  I was at the 2012 London Olympics. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2396.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2398.84s)]
*  And there was a lot of, I mean, Phelps was still there. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2399.84s)]
*  We had the Olympic team had all those dudes on it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2402.84s)]
*  And Usain Bolt was the ticket to get out of anything. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2405.84s)]
*  It's like, are you going to be there for the hundred? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2408.84s)]
*  That was it. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2410.84s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be in there to watch that dude run. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2411.84s)]
*  I think it's, and you and I have known each other forever. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2413.84s)]
*  It's a know it when you see it standpoint. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2418.84s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2421.84s)]
*  Like there's there's people like Aaron Judge that aren't quite there, but have a lot of. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2422.84s)]
*  He's getting closer. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2426.84s)]
*  He's getting, it feels like he's creeping closer to it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2427.84s)]
*  But I'll tell you this two years ago has it. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2430.84s)]
*  No question. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2433.84s)]
*  I'll say this two years ago, I took my family. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2434.84s)]
*  My daughter was like studying the Statue of Liberty and stuff. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2437.84s)]
*  So if you want to go up to New York, we went to New York and then we went over to the Yankees game. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2440.84s)]
*  I swear to even then, and this is before that season, I'd say 75 percent of that crowd had 99 judge or 99 judge shirt jerseys on. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2444.84s)]
*  I've never seen a stadium where everybody like you'd see a random like old school Jeter. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2456.84s)]
*  You'd see a random but like the whole crowd everywhere you went and I got it's a cool name and number. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2462.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2469.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2470.84s)]
*  But that was that one really took me a back where I was like because I went with Jacoby earlier this year to the Knicks games and they don't wear they don't wear gear. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2471.84s)]
*  Nick, like there's not. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2482.84s)]
*  It's all over the crowd. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2484.84s)]
*  There's retro stuff. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2485.84s)]
*  It's it's all over the place. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2486.84s)]
*  But there's not like you would expect Brunson stuff to be everywhere. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2488.84s)]
*  And it's just not. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2492.84s)]
*  And and most of the saddest is the Wizards games. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2493.84s)]
*  What's the Jersey scene at the Wizards games? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2497.84s)]
*  Are you are you locked in? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2502.84s)]
*  Are you on the other team? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2503.84s)]
*  That's that's I mean, it was packed for LeBron. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2504.84s)]
*  It was awesome when the Lakers came. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2507.84s)]
*  I mean, the game was over within the first half. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2509.84s)]
*  What number do you what number do you have in the draft next week? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2511.84s)]
*  The house. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2514.84s)]
*  Oh, let's talk. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2515.84s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2516.84s)]
*  Quick draft. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2517.84s)]
*  The devil's number. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2518.84s)]
*  How says six. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2519.84s)]
*  Give us your because we have conknipple coming later in the podcast. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2520.84s)]
*  Give us your preference at six. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2523.84s)]
*  Were you praying drops to six? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2526.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2528.84s)]
*  Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2529.84s)]
*  I didn't know what you could say. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2531.84s)]
*  I was just gonna say I did. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2533.84s)]
*  I'm having to like crash course this draft because Memphis traded their pig. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2534.84s)]
*  You weren't expected to know to get off of Marcus Smart. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2539.84s)]
*  So we didn't have a pick until two days ago. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2543.84s)]
*  I'm like, oh, shit, I gotta go. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2546.84s)]
*  I gotta go watch everybody. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2548.84s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2550.84s)]
*  House. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2551.84s)]
*  Who you open for? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2552.84s)]
*  I want the center from Duke. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2553.84s)]
*  Come on, Malawak or Malawak. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2554.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2556.84s)]
*  How do you say it? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2557.84s)]
*  The big giant seven two guy who can be a rim protector. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2558.84s)]
*  He's 18 years old, which puts him exactly right on the same timeline. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2561.84s)]
*  I know that we're still don't like to hear about timelines, but he's in that same age range. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2566.84s)]
*  You put him with with Sarr, Kula Bali, you know, the two other guys, Bob Carrington, George, this this young Washington team, all these these young guys. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2571.84s)]
*  And right now, the thing that that is missing more than anything else is a defensive stalwart. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2584.84s)]
*  And what we saw in terms of his ability to protect the rim and the rebounding, I think he would be. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2591.84s)]
*  And he fits in with Sarr too, right? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2598.84s)]
*  Because Sarr is almost like a stretch four slash five. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2600.84s)]
*  He prefers to be out of the perimeter and he could defend on the perimeter. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2603.84s)]
*  You guys are going to love this. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2607.84s)]
*  So I was going through all the names from the first round and I was like, all right, now I got a crash course on all of this. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2608.84s)]
*  And I got down to one of the names randomly and it like jogged my memory for some reason. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2614.84s)]
*  So about three weeks ago, I'm in Target and I'm I always go to Target when my kids go and I buy basketball cards. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2620.84s)]
*  Right. I go and buy the box of basketball cards. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2627.84s)]
*  So this guy's standing there, guy comes up to me, he's like, hey, and he recognizes me and he's like, starts talking about the Grizzlies. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2630.84s)]
*  And he's like, what cars you buy? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2636.84s)]
*  And I said, well, I was just going to buy those or whatever. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2637.84s)]
*  And he's like, get those Bowman chromes. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2640.84s)]
*  He's like, they've got the Cooper flag in it. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2642.84s)]
*  If you get the autograph, they're selling for like a thousand dollars. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2644.84s)]
*  I was like, well, then I guess I'm buying those. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2647.84s)]
*  Right. So I go to buy those. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2650.84s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to try to get the Cooper flag. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2651.84s)]
*  He's like, and again, I don't know this person. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2653.84s)]
*  And the guy goes to me, he goes, yeah, he's like, you know, everybody's chasing the Cooper flag and it's trying to get the autographs. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2656.84s)]
*  Everything. He's like, I'm going to tell you something. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2664.84s)]
*  The best player out of this entire draft is going to be Cedric Coward. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2667.84s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2671.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2672.84s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2673.84s)]
*  I didn't even know who the hell he's talking about. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2675.84s)]
*  And he's like, I'm telling you, just remember that a guy in Target told you this. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2677.84s)]
*  And I was like, okay. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2681.84s)]
*  So now I was going through it the other night and I was like, holy shit, that's the guy. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2682.84s)]
*  That's the guy. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2686.84s)]
*  Some random guy in Target told me that that's going to be the superstar. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2691.84s)]
*  That's the guy. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2696.84s)]
*  I mean, think about how many drafts where somebody in the 12 to 20 range suddenly became the best guy in the draft. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2697.84s)]
*  You know, I was looking at the the the Fandl odds for this because obviously Harper's going to flagstone one. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2703.84s)]
*  And when I was in Indiana last week, Edgecombe, the bailer, the electric bailer guard, he was minus 125. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2711.84s)]
*  And now he's minus 165 because of that ESPN story today about Ace Bailey not really working out with anybody. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2720.84s)]
*  What is the deal there? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2727.84s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2729.84s)]
*  Is this are we getting a Tarii Eason ding all over again? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2730.84s)]
*  Are we getting the... [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2734.84s)]
*  For Bailey, I feel like he's trying to maneuver his way to a team. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2735.84s)]
*  So I had this happen one time years and years ago. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2740.84s)]
*  Memphis had the I want to say it was the fourth pick in the I think it was the Conley draft. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2744.84s)]
*  I can't remember now. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2751.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2752.84s)]
*  But oh, no, no, it was before that. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2753.84s)]
*  But anyways, the top two pick or the top pick that year was Houston. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2756.84s)]
*  So it was the Yao Ming draft. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2760.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2761.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2762.84s)]
*  So that the top pick was Houston. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2763.84s)]
*  And there were guys that like Amari Sadamare only worked out for Houston and Phoenix. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2765.84s)]
*  And so then when everybody was picked, I think that was the year Memphis took Drew Gooden fourth. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2775.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2781.84s)]
*  So, of course, this becomes a huge topic here. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2782.84s)]
*  What the F? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2785.84s)]
*  We're supposed to have the whatever like the genius Jerry West. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2786.84s)]
*  He's running the team. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2790.84s)]
*  How the hell? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2791.84s)]
*  And Jerry West came out and said, look, this guy worked out for Houston and this guy worked out. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2792.84s)]
*  He went to 50 different high schools. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2798.84s)]
*  We never even could find him. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2800.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2802.84s)]
*  And it was like he was excusing not taking Amari Sadamare. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2803.84s)]
*  But it's funny, as you say, there have been guys that have done that in the past. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2807.84s)]
*  I went to the year they took Kashim to beat. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2813.84s)]
*  I went to all of the workouts. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2816.84s)]
*  And I thought James Harden was awful. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2819.84s)]
*  And it turns out he was just dog in the workout. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2822.84s)]
*  He just dog day. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2826.84s)]
*  That's back in those days. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2828.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2830.84s)]
*  This was very common. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2831.84s)]
*  That's what they said about Lamela Balder and Kovac dog in the Warriors interview because he wanted to go to Charlotte was always the story. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2832.84s)]
*  Well, and that's kind of been the thing with the Shadoor, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2840.84s)]
*  Where people said they was trying to direct himself somewhere. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2843.84s)]
*  That's why I wonder. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2848.84s)]
*  So Brooklyn has the eighth pick. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2849.84s)]
*  And I wonder if Ace Bailey is dreaming about being on Brooklyn with the eighth pick because he's not working out for anybody. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2850.84s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2856.84s)]
*  But with the Fandl odds, Knipple is the favorite to go for the plus 230. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2857.84s)]
*  Trey Johnson is the favorite to go fifth to Utah plus 190. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2862.84s)]
*  And then for House's Wizards with the six pick. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2867.84s)]
*  Ace Bailey, the favorite of plus 320. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2871.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2875.84s)]
*  And your Duke Center is plus 470. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2876.84s)]
*  I would just say this as somebody who's known House since 1988. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2879.84s)]
*  The Wizards drafting an unhappy Ace Bailey would give me life. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2884.84s)]
*  It's a new day. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2890.84s)]
*  The text all summer would be him sitting out summer league and House just getting madder and madder about it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2893.84s)]
*  As he gets dehydrated on another golf course. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2899.84s)]
*  That's where I want my summer to go. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2902.84s)]
*  We cut Johnny Davis here. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2904.84s)]
*  House has to go back to the hospital now. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2907.84s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2911.84s)]
*  Johnny. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2912.84s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2913.84s)]
*  That was Tommy Shepard's parting fucking gift. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2914.84s)]
*  My issue with Ace Bailey is what if he is an 18 year old Jordan Poole? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2917.84s)]
*  I mean, I just can't take it. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2922.84s)]
*  I can't. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2924.84s)]
*  You're going to have to get another eight IV bags for me. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2925.84s)]
*  I did some deep dive draft stuff. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2928.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2930.84s)]
*  There's some really interesting defensive stuff with him. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2931.84s)]
*  Like in a good way. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2934.84s)]
*  He's like a chase down block guy. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2935.84s)]
*  There's a whole. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2937.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2938.84s)]
*  If you watch those deep dive YouTube clips or they break down all the parts, they have a whole like chase down block section. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2939.84s)]
*  And in general, like he's I was kind of shocked how what kind of a rim protector he was. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2946.84s)]
*  And then his offensive game is very I got to say very similar to Joe House. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2952.84s)]
*  Joe House and his prime. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2958.84s)]
*  A lot of like just catch a shoe dribble, catch and shoot a lot of foul a lot of foul line. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2960.84s)]
*  18 footer nail spin. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2965.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2967.84s)]
*  He rebounds a little. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2968.84s)]
*  He doesn't pass. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2970.84s)]
*  He's a black hole. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2971.84s)]
*  I like to pass. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2972.84s)]
*  No, no, I'm saying for him. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2973.84s)]
*  He's a bite. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2975.84s)]
*  That was the one difference because you were a good passer. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2976.84s)]
*  But but yeah, I wonder if he's trying to get to Brooklyn. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2978.84s)]
*  Did you say you have canipal on your podcast? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2981.84s)]
*  He's coming up later. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2984.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was great. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2985.84s)]
*  Hey, now, are you all in? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2986.84s)]
*  Are you all in? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2988.84s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know you're in this was reminded me of I liked them and at Duke. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2989.84s)]
*  But there has been a couple of times where I've liked somebody and then it's like liking an indie band that then becomes famous. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=2996.84s)]
*  Like I thought he would be like in the 13 to 17 range because these guys always get discounted. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3002.84s)]
*  And then as it gets closer to the draft now, he's like in the top five. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3008.84s)]
*  But it's very similar to Westbrook. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3012.84s)]
*  Remember, we loved Westbrook at UCLA that year. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3015.84s)]
*  It was like, whoa, what a glue guy this guy is. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3017.84s)]
*  He's fucking tries. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3020.84s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he was the fourth pick. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3021.84s)]
*  You know, so I think with canipal, like he just brings all the stuff to the table that every team wants shooting, knows where to go. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3023.84s)]
*  They told I had a GM tell me that the year that the Westbrook year that they were at one of those like work out maybe it's in Chicago or somewhere like that. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3031.84s)]
*  But that Rose and Westbrook were like, like one and two in the line and that everything Rose was doing Westbrook was doing. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3042.84s)]
*  And all the GMs were just like, oh, my God, like this guy's he's his athletic. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3051.84s)]
*  It's the other guy. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3056.84s)]
*  Like what what is going on here? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3057.84s)]
*  And so it just but it does like this one like this is a this is a heater. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3059.84s)]
*  This guy can pull is on where it's like I looked at those what Sam Bacini I looked at his he's got like the magnum opus draft guy that he put out today. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3065.84s)]
*  It's like 60,000 words. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3077.84s)]
*  It really is. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3078.84s)]
*  And I think he's got kind of like three or something. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3080.84s)]
*  I get to get the very top. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3083.84s)]
*  But there's a bunch of the Rosilla love the very top. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3085.84s)]
*  So it's usually a tough grader. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3087.84s)]
*  Everybody likes him. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3089.84s)]
*  He does. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3090.84s)]
*  You need certainty in those first five picks. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3091.84s)]
*  You can't have you know, it can't be a gamble because if you gamble and lose, you're so fucked. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3094.84s)]
*  That's the problem with you know, you know, the wild card is how it like if you took this guy six, I wouldn't I don't know. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3098.84s)]
*  But fears the point guard who's reclassified. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3107.84s)]
*  So he's a year young and he's just like, you know, you almost have to think you're getting I don't know what you're getting. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3111.84s)]
*  But the ceiling of it, I don't even know. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3118.84s)]
*  I feel like Utah is going to take him. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3120.84s)]
*  He feels that could be another Utah possibility. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3121.84s)]
*  But just like crazy, crazy point guard skills. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3124.84s)]
*  But he's like a baby. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3127.84s)]
*  He's so you're buying in. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3129.84s)]
*  You're basically you're on like a three year plan with him. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3131.84s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like he's a little lower in these recent mocks. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3134.84s)]
*  He's in the six to nine. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3138.84s)]
*  I see him at seven. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3140.84s)]
*  He's leading the odds board at seven right now. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3141.84s)]
*  I bet he goes. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3143.84s)]
*  I bet he goes high as well. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3144.84s)]
*  And then that Derek Queen who everybody has in the 12 to 14 range, somebody will take him sooner than that. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3146.84s)]
*  It's just like somebody won't be able to resist. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3151.84s)]
*  It's either good. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3153.84s)]
*  And he's either going to be a guy that like is like awesome, like boogie cousins, or he's going to be a joke. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3154.84s)]
*  Or you're going to be like, oh, my God, yes, I don't want to. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3162.84s)]
*  He's from the DMV from University of Maryland. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3166.84s)]
*  I grew up rooting. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3168.84s)]
*  He's from Baltimore. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3169.84s)]
*  I grew up rooting for Maryland. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3170.84s)]
*  So this this the crab five, the run that they just went on in the NCAA tournament was awesome. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3172.84s)]
*  And the shot that he knocked down for them to get to, you know, move along. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3177.84s)]
*  I'm worried about his defense. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3184.84s)]
*  I'm worried about his ability to play professional NBA level defense. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3186.84s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3190.84s)]
*  Whatever team he goes to, he's like team dependent for me. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3191.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3195.84s)]
*  If he goes to the wrong team, I would be really worried about him. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3196.84s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3198.84s)]
*  Do you have a lower guy? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3199.84s)]
*  Do you have a lower guy you've fallen in love with, Bill? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3200.84s)]
*  I have a late second round guy that I like. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3203.84s)]
*  Oh, late second. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3207.84s)]
*  I always look at that. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3210.84s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3211.84s)]
*  I always look at the counting stats because sometimes I think we discount that somebody is just putting up stats. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3212.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3219.84s)]
*  So the guy who led the league and who led college in assists last year was Nemhard, his brother. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3220.84s)]
*  Oh, he's at Gonzaga's 511. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3226.84s)]
*  He's it's tough to make it at 511. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3230.84s)]
*  So he's 511 at 10 assists a game. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3233.84s)]
*  And then if you do that, first of all, the YouTube stuff with him is really good. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3236.84s)]
*  But if you go and like talk about like the quotes from teammates and coaches like Mark Fuse, like he's just like effusively praising us. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3240.84s)]
*  I just feel like he's one of those guys where like three years from now he's going to be on somebody's team in the in like the Eastern Conference finals. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3249.84s)]
*  You're like, wow, that is the 57th pick. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3257.84s)]
*  So he's like my stealth sleeper. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3260.84s)]
*  I haven't done enough. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3263.84s)]
*  I'm sad. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3264.84s)]
*  So I'm going to do all weekend. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3265.84s)]
*  Much to my wife's chagrin is study the rest of these dudes. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3266.84s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3268.84s)]
*  Now you look at these guys that are like even as we're watching the NBA Finals and it's like. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3269.84s)]
*  I mean, this Oklahoma City team who's now, you know, game away from being able to win the title. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3275.84s)]
*  They're crazy. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3280.84s)]
*  They're fourth leading scorer, their fourth leading scorer on the whole team was the 55th pick in the draft. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3282.84s)]
*  And Aaron Wiggins, he was their fourth leading scorer this year. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3290.84s)]
*  And it's like, damn, man, like, you know, how many years ago could we have talked about this and like, you didn't get any like you never got like there was like the right. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3295.84s)]
*  Like there was like the random Manu that was the draft and stash and there was like, but like a part of the second round picks and undrafted are like hitting and being awesome for teams that are winning. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3304.84s)]
*  Like the conference is now like even the Nemhard brother, right? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3317.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3323.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a high pick TJ McConnell, like Aaron Wiggins, Alex Caruso. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3324.84s)]
*  Like there's a bunch of second round and undrafted guys that are having like major rotation impact. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3329.84s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3336.84s)]
*  And this tells you how I've been doing gambling wise, although I did finally hit a nice one with Oklahoma City last night. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3337.84s)]
*  I would have bet five hundred dollars that Bill Simmons said his deep is his second round guy was Walter Clayton Jr. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3343.84s)]
*  The Florida. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3349.84s)]
*  Because he's going to be end of the first round. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3350.84s)]
*  Oh, he's he's pushed himself all the way up to the potential first round. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3352.84s)]
*  Listen, if the Celtics took him at twenty eight, I'd be delighted. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3355.84s)]
*  I'd have to look down at that. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3359.84s)]
*  I understand. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3361.84s)]
*  You know, I would have thought it would be like, well, no, I can't even. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3362.84s)]
*  Well, you got did you who got the twenty third pick? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3366.84s)]
*  Who did Indiana trade that twenty third pick to? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3369.84s)]
*  Is that Memphis or New Orleans? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3372.84s)]
*  No, no, New Orleans. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3373.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's right around the range where he I could see him going a couple spots too high. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3374.84s)]
*  I like that, too, though. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3379.84s)]
*  You like them, too, right? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3380.84s)]
*  I love them. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3381.84s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3382.84s)]
*  The stones on that kid is good. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3383.84s)]
*  Like all good. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3385.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3386.84s)]
*  All kidding aside, like the 16th pick in this draft might actually be somebody good. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3388.84s)]
*  So at least you'll be down the road to maybe replacing the best under 30 shooter in the league. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3393.84s)]
*  I tell you this, I'm looking down like right where you were talking about like that. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3401.84s)]
*  Ryan Nemhardt, he's like, I think on this ESPN mock, I just pulled up. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3406.84s)]
*  He's like 58. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3409.84s)]
*  But I mean, like you're at the end of that draft. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3411.84s)]
*  It's like senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3414.84s)]
*  And I super senior, super senior, senior, senior, super senior, senior. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3418.84s)]
*  Like because these guys all got to go to school extra and they got NIL and they stuck around, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3423.84s)]
*  I think this could be more like immediate impact from the second round that maybe you've ever seen before. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3430.84s)]
*  Like I had somebody tell me last week that one of the reasons, because I'd never understand why everybody's trying to get all these second round picks and hoarding them. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3438.84s)]
*  And one of the reasons they said was because college is so fucked up now. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3446.84s)]
*  And these guys have never on the same team for more than one or two years or they had extra eligibility. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3452.84s)]
*  And, you know, they just, it's just easier to get lucky with somebody who is in the wrong situation or they transferred to a new school and it didn't work out and they're stock dropped. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3457.84s)]
*  Well, and then it's held against you because these guys are actually 24 years old. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3467.84s)]
*  Like they're not what you're normal. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3474.84s)]
*  But it also makes them much more able to be able to contribute immediately in the NBA. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3477.84s)]
*  Yeah, new chaotic situation because they've transferred through them. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3484.84s)]
*  Well, this happened twice with the Grizzlies. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3488.84s)]
*  Desmond Bain, as we wrap this back up, Desmond Bain, it was ageist, like people that was held against him that he was older and Brandon Clark as well. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3490.84s)]
*  Another guy who was great at Gonzaga, but had gone to a small school prior to that. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3500.84s)]
*  And it's like, geez, like the answer to a lot of this is many times the guy that you they say they draft the 19 year old and they say, yeah, but what is he going to look like when he's 23? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3505.84s)]
*  And then the answer is typically not as good as Desmond Bain ever. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3517.84s)]
*  Right. Like he's probably not going to be that good. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3521.84s)]
*  That was the Celtics logic with Shireman when they took him. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3523.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, Baylor Shireman. He was like 24. He's been in a couple colleges, bounced around. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3527.84s)]
*  House, thanks for joining us on late notice and try not to pass on our golf course. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3531.84s)]
*  Do you have any early NFL futures you want to throw at us before we go? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3538.84s)]
*  Anything you were excited about? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3542.84s)]
*  Don't even talk to me. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3543.84s)]
*  Don't. No, no. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3545.84s)]
*  Why? I like the over for the Cowboys. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3546.84s)]
*  I don't want to hear anything you have to say. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3548.84s)]
*  I already bet they over for the Cowboys. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3549.84s)]
*  I like the Cowboys. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3551.84s)]
*  I like the Cowboys this year. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3552.84s)]
*  I think they're decent. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3553.84s)]
*  Are we going to act like me and you did not collectively lose a fortune together? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3555.84s)]
*  That was different. We're not doing that last year. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3560.84s)]
*  We did a bunch of AFC South teams. That might have been a mistake. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3563.84s)]
*  Houston was good. I like Houston to win that. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3567.84s)]
*  We bet on Aaron Rodgers and the Jets. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3570.84s)]
*  That was a mistake. That turned out to be a mistake. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3572.84s)]
*  Listen, I was there too. That was my biggest regret from all the futures last year, believing in Rodgers and the Jets. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3575.84s)]
*  And guess what? I'm not falling in for it this year. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3582.84s)]
*  The Steelers. You're not roping me in. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3585.84s)]
*  You don't have to bet. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3587.84s)]
*  No thank you. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3588.84s)]
*  Yeah, the Steelers. You can just stay away. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3589.84s)]
*  Houston to win the AFC South is my favorite. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3590.84s)]
*  I love the Rams this year. I have all the Rams futures. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3593.84s)]
*  So I did that when I was in Indiana last week. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3595.84s)]
*  I did. I jumped on Houston to win the South was still I think plus 110. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3598.84s)]
*  It was near even money. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3603.84s)]
*  So anything plus or even money, I'm like, let me put as much. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3604.84s)]
*  And the Chiefs were still near even money. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3607.84s)]
*  That's just like, you know, buying just buying a money bond. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3609.84s)]
*  Am I crazy or what? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3614.84s)]
*  The Chiefs not going to win the division. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3616.84s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3617.84s)]
*  Wasn't there some story about CJ Stroud like hasn't been able to throw a football in months or something? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3618.84s)]
*  That'll be fine. He'll be fine. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3624.84s)]
*  They were doing those soldier injuries. They're always fine. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3626.84s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3629.84s)]
*  I didn't see that story. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3632.84s)]
*  They were trying to get out of that bet. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3634.84s)]
*  Isn't that a thing? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3636.84s)]
*  CJ Stroud shoulder. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3637.84s)]
*  Isn't that a thing? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3638.84s)]
*  Well, the South like the Hunter trade was seems like it might end up working out bizarre. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3639.84s)]
*  The cold, stony times is already the QB and then Tennessee like how is Houston if they don't win the division, that's embarrassing. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3644.84s)]
*  Anyway. All right, guys. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3651.84s)]
*  Good times. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3652.84s)]
*  No, thanks for popping on. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3653.84s)]
*  Say hi to everyone in Memphis. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3654.84s)]
*  Don't I like Memphis? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3656.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3658.84s)]
*  As a city, I needed that. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3659.84s)]
*  I need some of the stuff that was out there this week. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3661.84s)]
*  That wasn't nice. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3663.84s)]
*  We needed it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3664.84s)]
*  We needed it. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3665.84s)]
*  What do you mean that the stuff that was out there this week? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3666.84s)]
*  What was the stuff about superstars don't feel safe in Memphis? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3670.84s)]
*  That's Stephen. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3673.84s)]
*  Hey, what was that, though? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3674.84s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3676.84s)]
*  It was, dude, many times and I'm glad you guys don't feel this way, but many times national media members, especially from big markets, feel like small markets are always in service of the big markets. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3677.84s)]
*  And so they're never delightful in their conversations about any of the small market teams that being set aside. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3693.84s)]
*  What Stephen A. Smith did was so damaging and irresponsible. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3701.84s)]
*  Like we fight uphill in Memphis against the perception of right. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3708.84s)]
*  And all I will say is you guys know I have been here for 25 years. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3713.84s)]
*  There has never been a player that I know of that has ever asked for a trade outside of Palgasol when the team was going to go into tank mode. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3717.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3729.84s)]
*  And they did right by him and they sent him to Los Angeles. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3730.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3733.84s)]
*  There has never been a player as far as I know that has not resigned once they have played in Memphis. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3734.84s)]
*  If everything was even, there's nobody that's walked off and has gone somewhere else. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3740.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3745.84s)]
*  And so when you have, it's not like it's been a franchise for five years. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3746.84s)]
*  When you've been a franchise for 25 years and you have all kinds of players that still Tony Allen lives here, Zach Randolph lives here, Mike Miller lives here, Taishan Prince lives here. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3750.84s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have still made Memphis their home. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3759.84s)]
*  There's been all manner of NBA players come through Memphis over the years. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3762.84s)]
*  Never once have I heard of them being the victim of some kind of violence. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3766.84s)]
*  And to me, what made me so angry about that whole thing was, yes, Memphis has problems. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3770.84s)]
*  OK. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3778.84s)]
*  And Memphis has the crime statistics of the crime statistics. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3779.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3782.84s)]
*  But these guys are not like the idea that you are saying, oh, well, Memphis players don't want to go to Memphis because because it's dangerous. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3783.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3795.84s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3796.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3797.84s)]
*  Have you ever heard that said about any other city, any other sports market, any other team ever? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3798.84s)]
*  Has that ever been a thing? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3810.84s)]
*  Did anybody say, hey, you know what? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3813.84s)]
*  Caleb Lewis might not want to go to the Bears. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3816.84s)]
*  You know, they got a lot of crime in Chicago or Kate Cunningham. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3818.84s)]
*  I don't know if he wants to play in Detroit. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3822.84s)]
*  You know, they got a lot of like to bring that up. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3824.84s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3828.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3830.84s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3831.84s)]
*  And so the conversation was about should they just trade John Moran? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3832.84s)]
*  And then it turned into, look, Jimmy Butler didn't want to go to Memphis because Jimmy Butler and others have told me that Memphis is dangerous. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3837.84s)]
*  Well, like there's 25 years of sample size of NBA players loving playing in Memphis. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3847.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3853.84s)]
*  They've never left. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3854.84s)]
*  And it's not just been hardened guys like the Tony Allen's and the ZEBOS. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3855.84s)]
*  Mike Conley was here for an awful long time at his names in the rafters. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3859.84s)]
*  And Marcus all was raised in Spain. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3863.84s)]
*  And after he was went to high school in Memphis and then played his entire career until he went to Toronto and L.A. at the very end. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3866.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3875.84s)]
*  Like so if it if players don't want to be there, then why do they always resign? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3876.84s)]
*  Why do they never want to be traded? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3882.84s)]
*  Why do they end up loving it and swearing by it? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3884.84s)]
*  You know, any city is and look, you guys know, as an even when I first took the job with you, Bill, I mean, if I had said, hey, yeah, I'll move to California. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3888.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3898.84s)]
*  Like I've always wanted to be here. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3899.84s)]
*  I was told years ago in order to have anybody care about what you were doing, you got to go to a bigger market. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3901.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3908.84s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of people in the media that still feel that way and they still feel that way about sport. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3909.84s)]
*  And so they will do anything to make sure like they just want Jerry Jackson, somebody on a team that's on TV, John Morant, somewhere else, whatever. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3915.84s)]
*  But to go out of your way to say players don't want to go there because it's dangerous to me is so far over the line because unless you want to tell how has that never been said about anywhere? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3925.84s)]
*  Washington, D.C.'s got got crime. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3941.84s)]
*  Chicago's got crime. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3943.84s)]
*  Detroit's got crime. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3944.84s)]
*  L.A.'s got crime. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3945.84s)]
*  Like all these places have crime. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3947.84s)]
*  I hate to tell you this. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3950.84s)]
*  Not only are these players insulated from them, if you talk to players, they are so much more beloved in small markets than they are in big markets because it matters more to us. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3952.84s)]
*  And they are a lot more involved in the community. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3964.84s)]
*  And they're reaching out and touching people and everybody. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3966.84s)]
*  It's like all for one, one for all. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3969.84s)]
*  And people are out in the grocery store. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3970.84s)]
*  They treat these guys like kings. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3972.84s)]
*  They treat them like kings, not like targets. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3974.84s)]
*  What? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3977.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3978.84s)]
*  You know this. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3979.84s)]
*  I love that. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3980.84s)]
*  I've been down to Memphis twice in five years. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3981.84s)]
*  I came to the house on Memphis. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3983.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3985.84s)]
*  Twenty nineteen. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3986.84s)]
*  Then again to come on the show with you guys. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3987.84s)]
*  That live show we did. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3989.84s)]
*  That's right. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3990.84s)]
*  And I got to spend probably like five, six days there for the Eastern the Western finals that time. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3991.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3997.84s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3998.84s)]
*  I power walked everywhere. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=3999.84s)]
*  The food I probably put I had to power walk because of the food. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4000.84s)]
*  But now it's great. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4004.84s)]
*  It's super. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4006.84s)]
*  It's super damaging for somebody to go on national TV and say players don't want to go there because. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4007.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4013.84s)]
*  You made a good. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4014.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4015.84s)]
*  I appreciate it here in the case that was heartfelt. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4016.84s)]
*  That was super annoying because look every city's got its problems. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4020.84s)]
*  Got to deal with the problems. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4025.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4026.84s)]
*  But come on dude. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4027.84s)]
*  Like being a professional athlete at Memphis is a great kick. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4028.84s)]
*  It's a great kick. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4031.84s)]
*  And not to mention you could I mean you could live in a Bill Simmons sized house for nothing. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4032.84s)]
*  I took a stray at the end there. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4037.84s)]
*  No no. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4041.84s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4042.84s)]
*  No it's a huge house. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4043.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4044.84s)]
*  I mean we don't have oceans. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4045.84s)]
*  We don't have oceans. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4046.84s)]
*  We got a river. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4047.84s)]
*  Great food though. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4048.84s)]
*  Great house. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4049.84s)]
*  Great to see you. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4050.84s)]
*  Take it easy this weekend please. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4051.84s)]
*  Burno a pleasure as always. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4052.84s)]
*  Good to see you. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4053.84s)]
*  Say hi to everyone in Memphis for us. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4054.84s)]
*  All right fellas. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4055.84s)]
*  See you. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4056.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4057.84s)]
*  My friend Kevin Hentges here. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4058.84s)]
*  We're taping this. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4059.84s)]
*  Two days after the big Raphael Devers trade that the Boston Red Sox made. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4060.84s)]
*  A trade that we had been talking a bunch about on our little Red Sox text thread that we're [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4064.84s)]
*  on. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4070.84s)]
*  Red Sox nation divided because nobody trusts the owners or the franchise or whatever they've [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4071.84s)]
*  been doing the last five six years. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4082.84s)]
*  We don't trust any of it. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4084.84s)]
*  And yet I think you and I both feel like we're not going to be able to do anything. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4085.84s)]
*  I think you and I both feel like the trade kind of made sense. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4089.84s)]
*  So they created all this money but now I don't trust them to do the right things with it. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4092.84s)]
*  And I don't know how to feel. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4096.84s)]
*  I'm you know when Mike Schur sent the text did we just trade Devers. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4097.84s)]
*  I was instantly delighted and I knew nothing of the particulars. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4102.84s)]
*  I was so happy to have a fucking guy who refuses to do the easiest thing in baseball to help [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4106.84s)]
*  his team. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4113.84s)]
*  I mean you know there are so many examples obviously last year when it's like hey we're [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4114.84s)]
*  Drew Holliday and Christoph Borzingis now you know there aren't going to be as many [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4118.84s)]
*  shots to go around and everyone's like that's fine. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4122.84s)]
*  That's no problem. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4125.84s)]
*  We want to win a chip and you know sports historically like you know Joe Thune going [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4126.84s)]
*  out to left tackle for the Chiefs. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4131.84s)]
*  He had to know he was going to get his ass handed to him. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4133.84s)]
*  He's a left guard you know but it's like you just do whatever the team needs for the guys [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4135.84s)]
*  in the clubhouse. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4140.84s)]
*  So we had a player making 10 20 30 times as much as the other guys in the clubhouse who [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4141.84s)]
*  is like I don't want to move a millimeter outside my comfort zone which he so he's taking [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4147.84s)]
*  it out on his teammates like obviously we need you to play first base. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4154.84s)]
*  We have Noah Sogaard playing first base. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4157.84s)]
*  You have to play first base and he was like I hate this team so much. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4160.84s)]
*  I'm willing to punish my teammates which by the way is why if you've read the subtext [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4164.84s)]
*  of all of his teammates fuck off. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4170.84s)]
*  Fuck off has been the subtext of everybody whose comments. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4173.84s)]
*  Not a lot of people coming out being like you know Raffy was a pro. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4176.84s)]
*  I'm going to really miss him. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4180.84s)]
*  Not a lot of that. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4181.84s)]
*  Even Poppy obviously saying like you certain things you have to do for the team. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4182.84s)]
*  So I immediately was like good riddance to that guy. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4187.84s)]
*  And then when I heard I mean we were over a barrel. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4190.84s)]
*  We're in fourth place. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4194.84s)]
*  We have too many players for not enough positions. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4195.84s)]
*  The fact that I was like they took on the whole contract and Kyle Harrison might be [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4199.84s)]
*  a number three starter in the majors. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4204.84s)]
*  Like I just couldn't believe the return we got given the bind we were in. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4206.84s)]
*  You know now I know your feeling is it was a little self-inflicted but. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4212.84s)]
*  Well hold on. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4216.84s)]
*  A little self-inflicted. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4217.84s)]
*  So go backwards. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4219.84s)]
*  So this goes to the big Red Sox incompetence the franchise piece of this where since they [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4221.84s)]
*  won the title in 2018 they've been all over the map starting with the Mookie Betts thing [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4227.84s)]
*  which was basically our version of the Luca Donce's trade in Dallas where just only it [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4232.84s)]
*  was a slow motion car crash version of it where we were watching it for 18 months going [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4238.84s)]
*  they're not really going to let him go right. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4242.84s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they trade him for five cents of the dollar. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4244.84s)]
*  Devers was the panic extension coming off them blowing the Zander Bogart thing a year [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4248.84s)]
*  before not extending him and then let him go to San Diego for a ton of money which actually [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4254.84s)]
*  turned out to be pretty good for them. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4259.84s)]
*  And the Red Sox fans are so mad they said and they just gave Devers all this money to [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4261.84s)]
*  be their third baseman. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4267.84s)]
*  And then two years later they signed Alex Bregman to play third base and Devers was [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4269.84s)]
*  like I have a tenure and so it starts there and it just gets worse and worse. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4276.84s)]
*  I blame everybody. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4282.84s)]
*  There are no good guys in this. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4283.84s)]
*  I definitely think one of the one of the columnists hit on it like communication was [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4285.84s)]
*  not strong obviously. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4289.84s)]
*  I don't know if you watch the studio with Seth Rogen right. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4291.84s)]
*  But it's like that episode where somebody has to give the bad note to the star. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4295.84s)]
*  Somebody has to tell tell the star or the director. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4301.84s)]
*  Is it Ron Howard? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4305.84s)]
*  So it has to give Ron Howard the note that you're making a mistake. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4306.84s)]
*  And I feel like this was the baseball version of that which is like hey somebody has to [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4309.84s)]
*  tell Raffy he's a terrible third baseman. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4313.84s)]
*  Has anyone had that conversation with Raffy yet? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4316.84s)]
*  Who's told Raffy that he sucks at third? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4318.84s)]
*  And so I mean obviously this crazy little zoom insight that we've all gotten that nobody [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4320.84s)]
*  thinks Breslow can communicate. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4327.84s)]
*  The GM of the Red Sox who people think is a non-communicator. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4329.84s)]
*  The guy literally an Ivy League molecular physicist not a great communicator. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4333.84s)]
*  What a shocker. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4339.84s)]
*  Amazingly clicked with John Henry. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4340.84s)]
*  They just went to a restaurant and just stared at each other awkwardly for two hours. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4342.84s)]
*  This is the perfect storm right. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4346.84s)]
*  You know English is the second language. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4348.84s)]
*  Dominican third baseman molecular physicist. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4351.84s)]
*  Hey you guys had a good talk about this right. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4354.84s)]
*  Well I don't know if you really knew what I was saying. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4357.84s)]
*  Like it's so insane. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4360.84s)]
*  So so Raffy is told like yeah we just got a Google off third baseman which is obviously [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4362.84s)]
*  going to help the team. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4369.84s)]
*  I don't know why the first base conversation wasn't already happening I guess because they [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4371.84s)]
*  still believed Casas was the answer there. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4375.84s)]
*  Although you know prior to Casas. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4378.84s)]
*  He was. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4380.84s)]
*  They wouldn't. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4381.84s)]
*  We were talking about all winter. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4382.84s)]
*  They wouldn't trade Casas for a pitcher because they love Casas. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4383.84s)]
*  But but gosh watching the you know before he got hurt he certainly did not look like the [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4386.84s)]
*  answer at first base. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4392.84s)]
*  But you know even if you're going to play Casas against righties. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4393.84s)]
*  Raffy should just have a first baseman's glove in spring training. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4398.84s)]
*  That just like if once Bregman's there. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4402.84s)]
*  But I would say this again so much that's been written and a ton has been written Buster [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4404.84s)]
*  only Tyler Keppner in the New York Times 10,000 texts in our text chain all all invoking [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4410.84s)]
*  Mookie Betts and well Tyler Keppner is the only one who invoked Babe Ruth. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4418.84s)]
*  So it's like OK Babe Ruth Mookie Betts Rafael Devers which one doesn't fit in this picture. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4423.84s)]
*  Like he's not Raffy Devers not Mookie Betts or Babe Ruth. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4429.84s)]
*  He's he's a very good hitter. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4435.84s)]
*  He's he's fat and slow and not a good base runner and he's and he hits the Yankees well. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4437.84s)]
*  But even his slugging percentages are not that nuts like it's just you and I both agree [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4443.84s)]
*  that that contract was going to get really bad really fast. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4448.84s)]
*  The panic contract. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4451.84s)]
*  So now that's somebody else's problem. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4453.84s)]
*  And I just you know I mean I'm going to love all the fly balls to left in San Francisco [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4455.84s)]
*  that are caught on the track. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4461.84s)]
*  Those are not doubles anymore Raffy. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4463.84s)]
*  And of course you're you're bitter. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4465.84s)]
*  This is I haven't seen such a bitter side from you in a while. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4468.84s)]
*  I'm such a team guy that it's like I mean and again Kyle Schwab are the ultimate example. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4472.84s)]
*  Like I will embarrass myself at first base. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4477.84s)]
*  I don't I don't know how to do it. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4480.84s)]
*  I don't know how to catch a chest high throw. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4482.84s)]
*  I don't know how to flip underhand to the pitcher and it and he's like but if that's what you need [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4484.84s)]
*  I will go humiliate myself in front of a sold out stadium to help the team versus Raffy Devers. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4490.84s)]
*  Like I'm butthurt. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4496.84s)]
*  I'm not going to help the team at all. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4497.84s)]
*  Well now then he does. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4499.84s)]
*  I mean one of the reasons we're doing this now is he did the Giants press conference and he's like I'll play wherever you made the key point. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4501.84s)]
*  He he did. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4507.84s)]
*  There were all these red flags from the moment they started at Bregman. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4508.84s)]
*  They clearly didn't talk to Devers like hey we're thinking about doing this. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4511.84s)]
*  If we did this you'd have to be the D.H. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4515.84s)]
*  But we think this is an amazing opportunity for us. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4517.84s)]
*  One of the reasons you're talking to Bregman was because they kind of were out of the loop on free agency for the whole winter. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4519.84s)]
*  Right. And then belatedly all of a sudden Bregman became a possibility that you go to Devers if you're thinking of doing this. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4526.84s)]
*  If he's your franchise guy which is the amount of money they gave to him you would think that's your guy. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4533.84s)]
*  You go to him and you say hey we're thinking about doing this. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4538.84s)]
*  You'd have to be the D.H. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4542.84s)]
*  But we really think the team would be awesome. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4543.84s)]
*  It would help you. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4545.84s)]
*  Your stats are going to be the best. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4546.84s)]
*  But they obviously didn't do any of it. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4548.84s)]
*  And then they just signed this guy and knocked Devers out of there. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4550.84s)]
*  And to be fair to him I do think he felt like I am your franchise third baseman even though I'm an awful defender. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4553.84s)]
*  And even though by the time I'm 33 I will just be like wearing concrete cleats basically. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4560.84s)]
*  I do think he felt like I'm the guy. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4568.84s)]
*  I'm the Brooks Robinson in Baltimore of this Red Sox team. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4571.84s)]
*  That is a great question. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4575.84s)]
*  You know it's like does Raffy know he's a terrible third baseman. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4576.84s)]
*  I doubt it. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4580.84s)]
*  We knew because it was like two thirds of your text I think about what a butcher he is at third base. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4581.84s)]
*  Like does Jalen Brunson think he's a good defender. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4587.84s)]
*  Does he not know why are they going at me on every possession. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4590.84s)]
*  Like because you're terrible. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4595.84s)]
*  Does Carl Anthony Towns know that he commits dumb fouls. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4597.84s)]
*  Like Devers might not know. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4600.84s)]
*  He might not have any idea. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4601.84s)]
*  I don't think Devers spends a lot of time on baseball reference like we do going deep. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4603.84s)]
*  Well the big thing with the Devers trade because you and I saw it the same way. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4609.84s)]
*  And then some of our other friends were like you know this guy's potentially one of the best 10 to 12 hitters in either league. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4612.84s)]
*  All the Yankee fans we know are rejoicing. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4620.84s)]
*  It's like thank God you got rid of Devers. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4623.84s)]
*  He killed us which is true. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4625.84s)]
*  You never want to make a trade where the Yankee fans are going nuts. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4626.84s)]
*  But I think both of us saw it the same way. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4629.84s)]
*  When you're giving those giant contracts to people in baseball and they're not position guys. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4632.84s)]
*  And they get older and they start you start heading town. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4637.84s)]
*  Jean Carlos Stanton Mountain pretty fast. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4641.84s)]
*  We're like wait how many years are left and there's just no way to unload it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4644.84s)]
*  It was kind of a miracle that San Francisco was like we'll take we'll take all of it. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4648.84s)]
*  And here's our best prospect from a year ago. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4653.84s)]
*  And here's our number one draft pick from last year. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4655.84s)]
*  And it's like the trade itself I can't argue with. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4658.84s)]
*  Yeah we beyond maxed out in terms of our return. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4661.84s)]
*  You know especially again given the bind that everybody knew we were in this bind. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4665.84s)]
*  We weren't negotiating from a position of strength. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4670.84s)]
*  And like you talk about these huge contracts. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4672.84s)]
*  The Blue Jays are three months into this Guerrero contract and it's a disaster. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4675.84s)]
*  He has eight home runs. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4679.84s)]
*  You know you know there's going to be it's going to get worse as it goes on. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4681.84s)]
*  The idea is that Vladimir Guerrero who had 48 home runs as a 22 year old is going to be better as a 26 year old. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4686.84s)]
*  You know so everyone is rushing to shit on the Red Sox and say this is the latest installment in this continuing trend. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4694.84s)]
*  And then they'll like invoke the Xander Bogart thing. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4703.84s)]
*  And it's like wait a minute that was amazing. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4706.84s)]
*  That was incredible that the Padres are on the hook for another quarter of a billion dollars for a guy with a six forty OPS. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4709.84s)]
*  And I think this Raffi contract is going to be a lot more like the Xander deal. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4717.84s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4723.84s)]
*  And this is and we were chronicling all this in real time. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4725.84s)]
*  None of the decisions made sense when you match them against all the other decisions. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4728.84s)]
*  Right. The crime with Bogart's was they could have signed him to an extension a year earlier for way less money than they didn't. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4733.84s)]
*  They did the sale extension that you and I almost had a conniption about. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4738.84s)]
*  And I was mad at the Red Sox not even following them full time. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4742.84s)]
*  But it was like really that's we're going to give sale. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4745.84s)]
*  But then and then the story contract Trevor story for the where it was nobody would sign him in for age six because they're worried about his elbow. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4749.84s)]
*  And then the Red Sox were going oh man we can get him for that price. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4756.84s)]
*  He was really good two years ago. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4761.84s)]
*  And then they signed him and he blows out his elbow. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4763.84s)]
*  But without bothering to check his home road splits in Colorado just to know what you're actually bad contract. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4766.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4772.84s)]
*  Or like G Alito and and and Bueller where you're spending you know you're getting like two expensive quarters instead of just trying to sign a dollar. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4774.84s)]
*  I just think they're all over the map. That's my bigger issue. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4783.84s)]
*  And I guess I I you know and again rarely the voice of optimism on the text read. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4786.84s)]
*  I'm usually the guy but I would say with crochet at the top of the order I mean you could argue we have the most dominant starter and the most dominant closer in baseball. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4791.84s)]
*  OK. In between some question marks although it looks like Whitlock might be turning the corner. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4802.84s)]
*  Bayo had a great start purely as a byproduct of us benching him and Roto and our keeper team. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4807.84s)]
*  We turned the season around. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4814.84s)]
*  So I mean you know G Alito is going to make a run at Hersheiser's fifty nine consecutive scoreless innings apparently. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4816.84s)]
*  So the team right now with these kids I mean you know there are no guarantees as as we've learned a million times. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4822.84s)]
*  But you know Anthony Marcelo Mare and April Christian Campbell are exciting at least if we if Casey can get back to what he was a mere six weeks ago. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4830.84s)]
*  Don't leave out Narvaez the rookie of the year. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4842.84s)]
*  And then Narvaez is a revelation. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4845.84s)]
*  You know as I said so we have a young catcher. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4847.84s)]
*  You know Jern Duran had an eight point seven war last year. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4850.84s)]
*  That's a very exciting player and that war is way over anything. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4854.84s)]
*  Raffy Devers has ever posted Devers has averaged a three point eight war for the last four full seasons. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4859.84s)]
*  You get nerdy with me. This is great. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4865.84s)]
*  It's just not it's just not impossible to find three point eight wins in other places. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4867.84s)]
*  Now watching the two nothing victory or the last night I did realize oh boy we're going to have a lot of trouble scoring runs until Bregman gets back. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4872.84s)]
*  But hopefully once Bregman and Abreu are both back you know the lineup has a little more length and we can keep winning these these three one games. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4883.84s)]
*  Well I as you know much to your chagrin I really backed off with the Red Sox for a few years after the bet straight. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4892.84s)]
*  I really had an issue with that. I didn't know if I was coming back and I got sucked in partly because we have Meyer on our AL Caper team. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4900.84s)]
*  We spent twenty five dollars on Christian Campbell. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4907.84s)]
*  We have Narvaez and I really got sucked back into the team and it's been a weirdly fun season for a team that for two straight months lost every one run game they played. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4909.84s)]
*  And if the game was in the 10th inning it was just a guaranteed loss. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4921.84s)]
*  But yet it was fun. It was something fun about them. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4924.84s)]
*  And I do like these teams that have the young kids like when we were growing up that 74 Red Sox team and they brought up Lynn and Rice near the end and then all of a sudden at 75 it blossomed. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4927.84s)]
*  We watched the pitchers in the 80s and all of a sudden they're on the 86 team. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4938.84s)]
*  We've had experiences like this before and it did suck me back in and then they do this Devers trade which was defensible. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4942.84s)]
*  But at the same time like oh we've saved all this money. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4950.84s)]
*  Now we get to use this money elsewhere and it's like I don't trust you to use this money or spend it. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4953.84s)]
*  Do you like do you even think they're going to spend it. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4959.84s)]
*  I mean what are they going to spend it on. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4961.84s)]
*  What do we need. We need relievers. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4963.84s)]
*  I'd love for them to extend Bregman now maybe while he's in the rehab pool. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4964.84s)]
*  Well his leverage is the best it's ever going to be right now right. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4969.84s)]
*  We do need another front line starter behind crochet. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4973.84s)]
*  And you know is Raffy going to get trimmer as he gets older. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4976.84s)]
*  It just seems like this it's funny because I've been feeling gaslit by baseball all spring in that I was like the Red Sox are not this bad and the Yankees are not this good. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4979.84s)]
*  I just couldn't understand as we plummeted into a double digit deficit in the standings I'm like how is Paul Goldschmidt hitting 350. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4989.84s)]
*  This is not supposed to be happening. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4997.84s)]
*  Well the regression of the mean has started. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=4999.84s)]
*  Judge is not going to hit 400 Goldschmidt's not going to hit 350 and the Red Sox are going to lose every one run game. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5001.84s)]
*  And in the same way I've been feeling gaslit by the Buster only and Tyler Kepner's of the world. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5007.84s)]
*  We're like well you can invoke Mookie if you want. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5013.84s)]
*  But the fact is this was an amazing escape act by the Boston Red Sox that to get out from under this onerous contract that's only going to get worse as baseball economics change. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5016.84s)]
*  You know with people watching MMA and Formula One is there going to be more money running around baseball like a three hundred and thirteen million dollar designated hitter is insane. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5029.84s)]
*  And in fact going back to the Mookie deal it's crazy given that we were giving the Dodgers a generational player for nothing in return that they would only eat 48 of the 96 million on the David Price contract. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5039.84s)]
*  It's like you should have eaten that whole contract. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5056.84s)]
*  You're getting the bets. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5059.84s)]
*  So again no one's defending that trade but the particulars of that trade make this trade look better. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5061.84s)]
*  They got a slow DH and they're eating the whole contract. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5070.84s)]
*  He's going to hit for San Francisco. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5076.84s)]
*  I would bet anything he has a big last four months he'll be rejuvenated. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5078.84s)]
*  You know where it's going to go. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5082.84s)]
*  We've seen I would also say this about San Francisco which is I you know I didn't I didn't realize I texted you but like I didn't realize what Robbie Ray was doing out there because we're in an alley right. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5083.84s)]
*  Our teams in the American League but I was like I was guys career was over like he hasn't won three games in three years. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5096.84s)]
*  He's eight and one with two point five and I'm sure he'll shut us out on Sunday in San Francisco. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5103.84s)]
*  But I was like I don't think the Giants are comparable to the Dodgers like I think they're they were close enough to believe that if they added a bat they could compete with the Dodgers. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5108.84s)]
*  But I don't I don't I don't think that's real and I actually think that by the All-Star break the Dodgers will be six games ahead of the Giants and pulling away. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5120.84s)]
*  Obviously well show hey hit 100. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5130.84s)]
*  Our friend Mike sure was didn't like the trade and made a point that I thought was really important about and it ties back to the bets trade why why I think the best trade is relevant to this because I think it's something though the owners in front office don't really fully understand with the Red Sox like the Yankees would never let judge go or trade judge right. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5136.84s)]
*  That's their guy. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5157.84s)]
*  They've made that decision five six years ago and the same way the Red Sox with Ortiz probably somewhere in the 2000s were like this guy's going to retire with us and I think like especially as I get older that's the kind of stuff I respond to with sports like the chance to root for somebody for 20 years and I think with bets. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5158.84s)]
*  That's what hurt the most with all that was like that just he just should have always been a Red Sox that and you when you strike oil with a guy like that and then to hear the owner talking about some of the reasons they decided he wasn't going to be worth it because we studied the history of these deals and as these guys get older and the and it's like this guy's of the freak athlete of all freak athletes who plays every position you want them to why didn't they have that same feelings for Devers why didn't they work for the Dodgers. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5178.84s)]
*  I mean I worry about what is this Devers deal going to look like when he's 35 why was it with Mookie Betts that that was who they were worried about I will never understand that. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5208.84s)]
*  Well I mean I think as everybody has written it as you have said is that that you know the Devers signing was not in a vacuum it was in response to the react. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5218.84s)]
*  Yeah it was the best thing the city has turned on us we have to do this. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5228.84s)]
*  Let's compound that mistake with another mistake. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5232.84s)]
*  The thing that's crazy about the Mookie thing I mean you know you and I have been through this a million times but generational talent five tools like does he's not just generational nobody's ever done what Mookie Betts you can't you can't be a gold glove right fielder and then go play shortstop and then turn the back end of a double [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5236.84s)]
*  play at second base and then hit for power but also hit behind the runner on a hit and run you know like it's crazy how singular he is he's a lot like Shohei in that regard like he's one of one. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5257.84s)]
*  Then you go to the next thing which is like the community is he a good citizen is he a good guy and you're like yeah obviously. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5269.84s)]
*  10 out of 10 on all that stuff. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5277.84s)]
*  He checks every box and he's feeding the homeless after playoff games and this is you know like Big Poppy has a lifetime ambassador contract with the Red Sox and that should have been Mookie Betts of course. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5279.84s)]
*  So I'm able to separate that mistake from this excellent trade I am I'm delighted. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5292.84s)]
*  Excellent I like it. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5300.84s)]
*  I cannot believe how much they ate and how much we got back because I was looking at Kyle Harrison I don't you know he's 23 like that guy is you know is a big leaguer that guy. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5302.84s)]
*  A year ago he was the number two pitching prospect that wasn't in the majors yet behind Paul skeins seems relevant. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5313.84s)]
*  It seems relevant and so and it's weird that Jordan Hicks was the lead name on the trade. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5320.84s)]
*  Yeah clearly he's kind of already pumpkined as a major leaguer and Kyle Harrison or maybe he's a reliever and shouldn't have been a starter. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5325.84s)]
*  I don't know I'm not giving up on him either. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5333.84s)]
*  You know I actually looked up because I because Devers did win a title for us right he was he was the last guy from the 2018 team. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5335.84s)]
*  Of course he made it ironically he makes that diving play toward the bag. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5342.84s)]
*  It's an insane play when you think about what a shitty third baseman he would become right. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5347.84s)]
*  It's a completely clutch defensive play also had a huge hit in that comeback. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5352.84s)]
*  Yeah so so technically he's not eligible because they did win a title when he was part of the team but it was you know he was young at that point and you wouldn't have said he was one of the four best guys in the team or anything so I don't know. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5356.84s)]
*  I have to I have to look back at the rules and see if he's eligible but I do think when you see how the team didn't react to the trade. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5368.84s)]
*  We didn't have players going like I can't believe we traded Raffy. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5375.84s)]
*  What are we doing here like none of that is right it's like hey and then you you hear Breslau who you know might be a maniac for all we know but he's like I think we're going to have a better record at the end of the year than we would have if we had him. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5379.84s)]
*  It makes me think this must have been pretty bad behind the scenes are pretty weird or pretty awkward or something. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5391.84s)]
*  So they feel like they're removing a literal very similar to Nomar in 04 when that got very similar to really weird. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5397.84s)]
*  And you know like if you look at the baseball card Orlando Cabrera and and Doug Mankiewicz is is not a great return on paper. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5403.84s)]
*  But you know when you and I talked about it it's going to make Derek Lowe better because as soon as we get better defensively Derek Lowe will be a better pitcher. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5412.84s)]
*  We love the trade. We were like we were like oh my God we have a shortstop with range who's going to be able to make plays. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5420.84s)]
*  You know and we had seen Nomar killing us on the field. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5426.84s)]
*  But yeah so I think it's going to be and I do think it's analogous Nomar refusing to go into that game in New York while G is planting his face on a metal chair. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5429.84s)]
*  And Nomar's outing that is the analogy that feels right. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5440.84s)]
*  So you have a guy that the team needs to play first base. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5443.84s)]
*  He's saying I would rather just work my 12 minutes a night. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5446.84s)]
*  I mean what is a DH's job. It's insane. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5450.84s)]
*  You have a 12 minute work day. You work these four installments. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5453.84s)]
*  It's going to get psyched up for every at bat. I might be hitting again in 40 minutes. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5457.84s)]
*  You sit you sit around and the team needs you. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5461.84s)]
*  So you know it's funny because you and I have talked a little bit about this. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5465.84s)]
*  We're old now. We're in we're in this older generation. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5469.84s)]
*  And it's like you know I think you and I both seen some of the Gen Z attitude the entitlement. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5472.84s)]
*  And of course of course they're entitled. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5478.84s)]
*  We've done nothing but tell them how awesome they are their whole lives. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5480.84s)]
*  Oh my God this awful finger painting is going right up on the fridge. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5483.84s)]
*  Genius like of course they're fucked up. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5487.84s)]
*  But I really did feel like the I'm not going to play first base. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5490.84s)]
*  I've already the quote where he said I've already learned a new position. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5495.84s)]
*  I've learned how to sit on the bench. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5500.84s)]
*  What is DH tell us walk us through learning how to DH. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5503.84s)]
*  Plus like if I was a professional baseball player I'd want to play first base. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5508.84s)]
*  It would just be more interesting. You get to be in the field. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5511.84s)]
*  You might be might be involved in the action. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5514.84s)]
*  I would just rather do that in a below average third baseman can be a pretty good first baseman pretty quick. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5516.84s)]
*  There's not there's not that much to do. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5522.84s)]
*  Although I will say Abraham Toro and the collection of guys trying you know the Red Sox first baseman do this thing on every routine ground ball the second base. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5524.84s)]
*  They sprint and lay out. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5535.84s)]
*  So it's like OK if the pitcher's not over there it's another infield hit. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5537.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5541.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5543.84s)]
*  We passed a lot of time for this. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5544.84s)]
*  Pats I was in India and I did Pats over nine and a half wins plus 160 on Fandel couldn't have been more excited about it. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5546.84s)]
*  Also bet some variable plus 750 coach of the year. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5553.84s)]
*  I mean I love it. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5556.84s)]
*  We are in the Roman Anthony Drake May era. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5558.84s)]
*  It's a new day. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5560.84s)]
*  Don't don't forget about our guy Marcelo Meyer who we have on our fantasy team as well. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5562.84s)]
*  It's a beautiful swing. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5567.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5568.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5569.84s)]
*  Hatch good to see you. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5570.84s)]
*  Thanks for venting to us. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5571.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5572.84s)]
*  Thanks brother. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5573.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5574.84s)]
*  We're taping this midweek. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5575.84s)]
*  Conk Nippos here. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5576.84s)]
*  He went to Duke University. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5577.84s)]
*  Not for long. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5578.84s)]
*  He's going to be in the NBA draft. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5579.84s)]
*  He's going to be drafted somewhere I would say in the top eight. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5580.84s)]
*  But it's starting to seem like it's climbing higher than that. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5583.84s)]
*  You've done a lot of interviews. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5586.84s)]
*  This is the best one. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5588.84s)]
*  I think this is the peak right here. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5589.84s)]

*  family sent a picture of you reading my book when you were a little kid which I thought [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5627.84s)]
*  was hilarious that my book is now old enough that people who read the book as little kids [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5630.84s)]
*  are now being drafted in the lottery. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5635.84s)]

*  like basketball camps, coaching your team? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5643.84s)]
*  Like what was like your family situation? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5646.84s)]
*  How'd you end up being like Mr. Basketball in Wisconsin? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5648.84s)]
*  How'd you end up being a top five lottery pick potentially? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5651.84s)]
*  Yeah so both my parents played college basketball. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5654.84s)]
*  My mom played UW Green Bay and then my dad played at Wisconsin Lutheran College which [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5658.84s)]
*  is a D3 in Milwaukee. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5668.84s)]
*  So they, I mean obviously they loved hoops and they wanted me to play. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5670.84s)]
*  My dad wasn't like a crazy coach or anything following me around so I never played for [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5674.84s)]
*  him or anything but they definitely made sure I worked on my game and got me in the gym [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5679.84s)]
*  as much as they could and then really helped me out that way. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5685.84s)]
*  Wait I want to hear about the games for the parents. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5688.84s)]
*  So what was your mom's game? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5690.84s)]
*  What was her position? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5691.84s)]
*  What was her like, what was her skill set? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5692.84s)]
*  Yeah so she's 6'1". [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5695.84s)]
*  And so she was a post at Green Bay and she's actually the all time leading scorer there. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5699.84s)]
*  So she's, I mean she loves to say Kevin McHale. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5706.84s)]
*  The footwork, nice. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5712.84s)]
*  Yeah footwork up and under was the go to move but she didn't have quite as deep of a bag [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5714.84s)]
*  as him but that's what she likes to say. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5720.84s)]
*  And what about your dad? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5723.84s)]
*  My dad, he's like 6'4". [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5725.84s)]
*  And in D3 he was like a 3 or a 4 but he could really shoot it. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5728.84s)]
*  I say a 3 or a 4 because he averaged like 10 rebounds a game his sophomore year. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5735.84s)]
*  But yeah it was really just like a shooter, mid-range, 3 point. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5740.84s)]
*  He's actually, I think he's the all time steals leader there too so a little bit of anticipation from him. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5745.84s)]
*  But I don't know if I could put really a player on him because his go to move is a post fade away at 6'4". [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5750.84s)]
*  It's like TJ McConnell. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5757.84s)]
*  Yeah right. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5759.84s)]
*  Yeah getting into the lane, bouncing backwards. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5760.84s)]
*  Well it's interesting so you got the shooting probably from your dad's side but some of the footwork. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5762.84s)]
*  One of the things like watching all the tape with you, you have this herky jerky around the rim up fake game [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5767.84s)]
*  when you get into the paint that like you're patient, you'll wait, you'll do, and then you'll, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5774.84s)]
*  you know it's a little like TJ McConnell has it, Prichard, not to mention all the white guys, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5780.84s)]
*  but Prichard has it, people around the rim who don't necessarily go right to the basket [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5784.84s)]
*  but kind of use defenders against themselves. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5790.84s)]
*  Which I noticed with you, the other thing that, I mean the catch and shoot stuff is unbelievable. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5793.84s)]
*  The footwork, but what do you think is the best part of your offensive game that you're the most proud of? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5798.84s)]
*  Yeah I think probably the shooting now. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5806.84s)]
*  Like I used to not, like growing up I wasn't always a great shooter. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5808.84s)]
*  So like I really had to work on that. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5812.84s)]
*  Just like in my mechanics and all that stuff. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5815.84s)]
*  I always had good form but I just, for whatever reason I wasn't always a great shooter. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5819.84s)]
*  So like in 9th grade you weren't like a dead eye? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5824.84s)]
*  Like right when I got to high school is when I started to become a really good shooter. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5828.84s)]
*  So like in middle school I couldn't shoot threes like that. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5832.84s)]
*  Were you taller? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5836.84s)]
*  Uh, kinda. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5839.84s)]
*  Because I noticed in your high school stats, you actually were rebounding [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5842.84s)]
*  and it seemed like you were almost being played a forward. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5846.84s)]
*  Yeah, no I was like a forward for my first three years before my senior year when I had to handle the ball. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5849.84s)]
*  But like yeah, I definitely got to, when I got to high school I was like alright I gotta be able to shoot threes. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5855.84s)]
*  And that's kind of been the thing that I can always rely on in the offensive end to create advantages for myself. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5861.84s)]
*  So I'd probably say that for sure. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5867.84s)]
*  Well, I mean I'm sure I'm slightly to blame for this but when guys are in the draft, we love doing comps. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5870.84s)]
*  I remember doing the draft for ESPN in 13 and 14 and forcing them to do a player comp segment. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5877.84s)]
*  Which Jalen was terrible at. I used to make fun of him. He could never get the hang of it. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5882.84s)]
*  Now he's better at it. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5886.84s)]
*  But you've had some fun ones. Like the comps for Conk Nipple are all over the map. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5889.84s)]
*  But one of the ones that I think is somewhat valid, there's some clay stuff with you that I think some people have mentioned. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5895.84s)]
*  I mean that would be the ideal if that was a clay type of career, right? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5902.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that would be the absolute, that would be awesome. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5906.84s)]
*  I've always tried to, everybody wants to play like clay if you're a shooter. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5911.84s)]
*  And he also was a great defensive player back when he, before the injuries and before he's gotten older now. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5916.84s)]
*  But that's someone you look up to when you're a player like me and that would be absolutely awesome. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5925.84s)]
*  It's funny you mentioned the draft stuff because me and my family were actually just watching in between one of the finals games. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5931.84s)]
*  I was like we got to watch, I don't know how it came up but there was like your highlights from the 2013 draft on YouTube. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5938.84s)]
*  The whoa! That and you were just spot on the whole draft. It was really funny. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5945.84s)]
*  So I was watching that with my dad and my family outside while we were at halftime of the finals. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5952.84s)]
*  Oh that's funny. Yeah, I had a good draft that year. I don't think the next year I did as well. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5957.84s)]
*  But that was one of the great drafts because it was David Stern's last draft. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5961.84s)]
*  Nobody knew who the first pick was going to be. It ended up being Anthony Bennett. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5965.84s)]
*  Yannis was in the draft. Nobody knew what to make of him. And it was just all over. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5969.84s)]
*  There was a big Celtic trade in that draft. But when I look at this stuff, and this is why it's so funny with your rise as a prospect. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5974.84s)]
*  You're always going to be a first rounder. But I remember when I started watching Duke because I love Cooper Flagg. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5982.84s)]
*  I was like, I just thought he had it. Especially somebody weaned on the 86 Celtics is my kind of guy. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5987.84s)]
*  But the fact that he reclassified, he's playing older kids. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=5995.84s)]
*  He reminded me so much of the stuff I loved about KG, even though they're not the same size. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6000.84s)]
*  But just the competitiveness, how he's good at everything, how he's an anchor, he's a good passer. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6005.84s)]
*  So I started watching Duke and I was texting our college basketball guys. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6011.84s)]
*  I'm like, what's up with this Knipple? Where's he supposed to go in the draft? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6015.84s)]
*  Because he keeps jumping out to me. They were like, oh no, he might be a lottery pick. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6019.84s)]
*  And I was like, this seems like the kind of guy they're going to screw up. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6023.84s)]
*  And I ended up going 19th and then he'll be really good. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6026.84s)]
*  I'm like, how did he fall to 19? But somewhere in the mix in the last two months, you jumped up. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6028.84s)]
*  And now you're in like, you're in the top five conversation. When did that flip? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6035.84s)]
*  You know, I don't really know. I think a lot of it helped with the ACC tournament when Cooper was out. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6043.84s)]
*  So being able to see me in a scenario where I'm the guy for a couple of games. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6052.84s)]
*  And then just kind of carrying that over into the NCAA tournament. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6058.84s)]
*  I think that helped. But then, I mean, I don't really know. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6063.84s)]
*  I haven't played in front of anybody other than the team workouts I've been doing. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6067.84s)]
*  So I guess it made a decent impression in some of my interviews. And I don't know. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6072.84s)]
*  What do they ask you in these interviews? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6078.84s)]
*  Do you feel like they're trying to get under the hood with you and try to break you psychologically? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6080.84s)]
*  Or what are they up to? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6084.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6086.84s)]
*  You know, like you always hear the stories about like people getting like asked ridiculous questions. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6088.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6092.84s)]
*  I didn't really have many of those. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6093.84s)]
*  I think they're really just trying to get to know you. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6094.84s)]
*  What makes you tick? How you think the game as a player? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6096.84s)]
*  You know, some teams they'll do. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6101.84s)]
*  They'll have you draw step up on a board. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6104.84s)]
*  They just want to hear how you talk about the game, how you talk about scenarios and in the course of the season, like what your defensive coverages are. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6106.84s)]
*  They want to get into all that stuff and then baseline stuff about like who you are as a person as well. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6117.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's see, I would do it completely differently if I ran a team. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6123.84s)]
*  I would be I'd be so interested in work ethic. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6127.84s)]
*  What your day to day routine was. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6130.84s)]
*  Do you feel like you're the player you can be five years from now? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6133.84s)]
*  I would be going into all the hardwire stuff because I honestly at the point you're at now with a lot of these prospects, they're all pretty much around the same talent. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6136.84s)]
*  And then the work ethic and like having one elite skill. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6146.84s)]
*  And then that's when it starts to separate. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6149.84s)]
*  But like I'm sure you saw that with Cooper, like he's famous for that. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6151.84s)]
*  Like he's just a maniac in every way. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6155.84s)]
*  He's famous for that. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6157.84s)]
*  Like he's just a maniac in every single drill, every day, every practice, everything. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6158.84s)]
*  And it really does feel like those are the guys that ascend. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6164.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6166.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6167.84s)]
*  And I think they try to get a feel for that, too. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6168.84s)]
*  So some of those questions that you were saying. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6169.84s)]
*  But yeah, like when you mentioned a guy like Cooper, like that stuff is kind of evident, too, in the way he plays. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6171.84s)]
*  Like he doesn't take plays off in the game. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6178.84s)]
*  So you can you could kind of see how that would correlate to a practice. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6180.84s)]
*  Like he's not taking any drills off. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6183.84s)]
*  He wants to win every drill. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6184.84s)]
*  That stuff carries over. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6185.84s)]
*  Does that carry over to the teammates? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6186.84s)]
*  It must, right? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6188.84s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6189.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6190.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6191.84s)]
*  I mean, I think I think for the most part we had we had guys that are stealth driven in that way anyway this this past season. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6192.84s)]
*  But I mean, when the best guy is doing it, everybody's going to do it. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6198.84s)]
*  Or you look at me and it's been two months now. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6203.84s)]
*  Do you look back at that Final Four just like. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6206.84s)]
*  Is this going to haunt me the rest of my life? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6210.84s)]
*  What is your relationship to that game now that it's it's in the rear view mirror? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6212.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I told my I told my assistant coach, Coach Dildy, the night the night of the game, like right after the right after the game, we got to the hotels like I was we're going on the elevator and I was getting off and I was like, I'll never forget that for the rest of my life. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6216.84s)]
*  Like that'll just that'll just sit with you. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6227.84s)]
*  Just one of those games. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6230.84s)]
*  And it's you know, it's it's tough. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6231.84s)]
*  Like I took me about. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6233.84s)]
*  Like a month to watch your episode on it. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6236.84s)]
*  You and Rossello did an episode on it. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6238.84s)]
*  Yeah, it took me about a month to get around to that. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6240.84s)]
*  And I thought you did a really good job. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6243.84s)]
*  I think you had a tweet about it, too, that like broke down all the things that went wrong down the stretch. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6245.84s)]
*  And like you just flip one of those things and you win the game. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6251.84s)]
*  So it's one of those that just that eats at you. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6254.84s)]
*  But but now you know, I'm not going to be able to do that. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6257.84s)]
*  Yeah, and sort of that sense. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6260.84s)]
*  But when someone brings it up, it doesn't doesn't bring up good feelings. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6261.84s)]
*  Well, the good thing is when you're much older and you're like my age, you can barely remember anything. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6265.84s)]
*  So don't worry. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6271.84s)]
*  I don't want you that much. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6272.84s)]
*  But it is it is crazy that team you had, though, and like I'm just looking in the context. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6273.84s)]
*  I'm a casual college basketball player. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6279.84s)]
*  I'm a very good basketball player. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6281.84s)]
*  I'm a very good basketball player. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6283.84s)]
*  I'm a very good basketball player. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6285.84s)]
*  I'm just looking in the context. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6287.84s)]
*  I'm a casual college basketball fan. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6289.84s)]
*  I'll float in. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6291.84s)]
*  I'll watch certain teams. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6292.84s)]
*  But then I really get into the draft and I really enjoy that part and trying to come up with my weird takes on everybody. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6293.84s)]
*  But your team is so fun from a 2025 draft standpoint. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6299.84s)]
*  You know, even even the center like like could he make could he go fifth? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6304.84s)]
*  Could he go sixth? Could he go eighth? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6310.84s)]
*  And he makes sense with a bunch of different teams, too. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6311.84s)]
*  I do wonder if after the draft, people be like, wow, look at where all those guys went in the draft. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6315.84s)]
*  How did they not win? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6320.84s)]
*  But that's the thing about college basketball. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6321.84s)]
*  It's one game. It's not like, you know, you're not playing the best of seven. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6323.84s)]
*  Right. The best team always wins the best of seven. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6327.84s)]
*  Yeah, I feel unless some injury happens or something. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6330.84s)]
*  But in college, it's just it's always a toss up. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6334.84s)]
*  You know, those are the end of the game. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6338.84s)]
*  Yeah, because even OKC Indiana, I remember after game three, Indiana goes up. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6340.84s)]
*  Now, I'm at the game. I'm doing the pod with Zach and both of us were like. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6348.84s)]
*  Man, this isn't usually how basketball goes. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6352.84s)]
*  Usually like the best team, if in a four out of seven, the best team almost always wins unless something crazy happens like Indiana had the reverse. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6355.84s)]
*  We're now how Albert insert. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6364.84s)]
*  But for the most part, if you're going to play seven times, usually the right team wins. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6365.84s)]
*  Right. But in a one gamer, who the hell knows? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6371.84s)]
*  All right. So some of it looks like you're in the three to seven range. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6374.84s)]
*  So do you work out with Philly? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6378.84s)]
*  I have a zoom with them this week, but I did not work out with them. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6380.84s)]
*  Do you start because you're like an actual basketball fan. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6387.84s)]
*  Do you look at all these teams and try to figure out like, hmm, what would I look like in this situation? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6389.84s)]
*  What would I like? Is your brain even go that way? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6394.84s)]
*  You try not to think about it. Yeah, I mean, you do a little bit. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6396.84s)]
*  But I think like something I learned big time here at Duke this year is my first time not being the best player on a team. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6401.84s)]
*  You know, I probably could have went to another college and been the been the best player. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6408.84s)]
*  But just learning how to like affect the game. Yeah. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6414.84s)]
*  When the ball is not in your hands or when you're not the number one guy and learning about myself that I can still be an effective player doing that. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6418.84s)]
*  So I feel pretty confident in like any situation I'm going to go into that I'll be able to affect winning and be able to contribute. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6426.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6434.84s)]
*  And I'm Rossello is a big fan of your prospects, too, for the next level, because we tend to gravitate toward the guys that we just feel like could fit in in any type of situation. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6435.84s)]
*  Right. Like you look at Philly, Philly's got guards, they have been beat. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6446.84s)]
*  It's pretty easy to see where you would fit in there. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6450.84s)]
*  Like you would spread the floor for them. You might be able to initiate some offense. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6452.84s)]
*  Then you go to a team like like Utah where they have marketing and they have the guards. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6455.84s)]
*  But then I could also see where you fit in with them. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6461.84s)]
*  Charlotte's like kind of perfect with the Mello and Bridges and Brandon Miller. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6463.84s)]
*  Like they clearly need somebody like you. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6467.84s)]
*  So you go on through and I don't know, it just feels like you could fit in any situation. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6470.84s)]
*  You can play multiple positions, right? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6474.84s)]
*  Like potentially you could play a three in some position in some situations. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6476.84s)]
*  You could be a two. You could initiate some offense. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6479.84s)]
*  Like I'm not worried about you. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6482.84s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely think, you know, I tend to have a little bit like I have a versatile skill set beyond just the shooting. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6484.84s)]
*  Like you can get on the court shooting anywhere that you could play for any team if you could shoot the ball. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6493.84s)]
*  But definitely some of those other skills that I can bring to the table, like you mentioned, initiating offense and stuff like that stuff is valuable to any any team. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6500.84s)]
*  Rebounding with the catch and shoot stuff. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6507.84s)]
*  That's I mean, that's hard work because that's a different kind of skill set. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6511.84s)]
*  So you must have spent like some serious time working on that. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6516.84s)]
*  Right. Yeah. When I was like when I got to like that high school like freshman sophomore, like I would I was on a shooting machine, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6520.84s)]
*  which I stopped doing because I got like practice more off the move and all that stuff. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6528.84s)]
*  But like I really hammered down my mechanics like I was a very like my brother is a really good shooter and he he can just fling it. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6534.84s)]
*  You know, like it's natural. Like mine is very good word for it. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6544.84s)]
*  Just very fundamental. Like I have it's got to be a strong shot. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6551.84s)]
*  Like everything has to has to come together. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6555.84s)]
*  So I think I think definitely just the amount of time I put working on my form and my mechanics really contributed to that. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6558.84s)]
*  But I think I think going forward now, like it's it's like riding a bike kind of. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6569.84s)]
*  Right. Yeah. You put a lot of time into it. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6574.84s)]
*  I put so much time into that before and now I can just keep like adding different ways to shoot. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6576.84s)]
*  Like right now I'm working a ton off the dribble. That's an area I need to grow. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6581.84s)]
*  It's it and it's just it's just different. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6586.84s)]
*  You know, like it's just a different feel is just to catch and shoot whereas or an off the dribble or an off the move shot. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6588.84s)]
*  But that that's like kind of the baseline. It's like form shooting almost. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6595.84s)]
*  Yeah. And you have to and you're already pretty good at like coming off the screen at the top. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6598.84s)]
*  Yeah. Doing the one handed across the court pass, which I don't know when that pass got started. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6603.84s)]
*  But all of a sudden now it's like it's like a must if you have the ball. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6608.84s)]
*  Everybody and it's high degree of difficulty on it. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6612.84s)]
*  What are the thing you're most worried about the next level? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6615.84s)]
*  What's your whole. Yeah, I mean, I think everybody's, you know, like I guess playing into the stereotype a little bit of, you know, white guy. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6618.84s)]
*  They're going to they're going to challenge you defensively. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6628.84s)]
*  They're going to go at you, see what you're made of. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6631.84s)]
*  So just being ready, ready for that and being really focused on that. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6633.84s)]
*  And so every time you go out there, just being just being really focused on that and is going to is going to be really key being hunted. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6638.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny, though. Sometimes that can work in your favor because like the funniest was that Celtics Hauser. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6647.84s)]
*  They would hunt Hauser and not realize that it was actually a bad idea a lot of the time. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6654.84s)]
*  But everyone would try to do it. They like the white guy. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6658.84s)]
*  Let's go get him. And then then it wouldn't work out most of the time because he was actually a pretty good one. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6660.84s)]
*  I'm pretty good. Yeah, because he put for Tony Bennett at Virginia. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6665.84s)]
*  He's all right. Slide his feet. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6670.84s)]
*  And Pritchard was another one that he was undersized, but he would fight, fight, fight and do it. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6672.84s)]
*  So when you watch, I'm sure you've watched a ton of the finals. Right. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6677.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6681.84s)]
*  So do you do you try to envision like, could I play in this level? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6682.84s)]
*  Who would I be on this Indiana team? Could I have been in the Wigan spot on this OKC team? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6687.84s)]
*  Are you thinking that or are you just watching the games? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6693.84s)]
*  Yeah, you think about it a little bit like I went to both Bucks games when they played Indiana. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6695.84s)]
*  So just like kind of thinking about, man, like, how could I? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6701.84s)]
*  You know, the first thing you see in the playoffs is the physicality. Yeah. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6705.84s)]
*  How are you going to how are you going to adjust to that? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6709.84s)]
*  You think about how you can can help teams and, you know, I really gravitated towards Neesmith in that first round. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6712.84s)]
*  Yeah. And like, I mean, he's been really he's been awesome. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6717.84s)]
*  Like, I just love his shot. Like, he always gives it a chance. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6721.84s)]
*  Like every time he releases it, it feels like it's going it's either going long or it's going in. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6725.84s)]
*  Yeah. It's not it's he's never missing it short. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6729.84s)]
*  So I gravitate towards him and, you know, he's got he's got really long arms and stuff. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6731.84s)]
*  But just he's a great shooter and and uses his body and his physicality well in defense. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6736.84s)]
*  You Bucks fan. Is that fair to say? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6742.84s)]
*  Was that your team? Yeah, I know. Yeah, absolutely. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6745.84s)]
*  So when they won in twenty one, you're going nuts. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6747.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it was that was a special time. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6750.84s)]
*  We're a long ways from there. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6755.84s)]
*  But I know, you know, it's funny, I had Doc on my podcast yesterday and we were talking about the East is so wide open. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6757.84s)]
*  They have the best guy in the conference. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6765.84s)]
*  Everybody thinks they're going to trade him and they're not. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6767.84s)]
*  And it's you have the best guy in the conference. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6769.84s)]
*  You have to feel like you have a chance, even if the rest of the team is a little rocky. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6772.84s)]
*  But I think that's kind of where they've landed, at least for the next year. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6776.84s)]
*  The East is so wide open. You're probably going to be in the East, right? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6779.84s)]
*  Unless it's Utah. All the other teams are three to eight. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6783.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. New Orleans. The other one. Yeah. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6788.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6790.84s)]
*  So I've given up my books fandom. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6792.84s)]
*  That's it now. Yeah. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6794.84s)]
*  So, I mean, I. Yeah, I guess. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6797.84s)]
*  I guess that's fine. Just Cooper can't give up the Celtics thing because we're counting on him in six years. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6800.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's six years. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6805.84s)]
*  We'll find out if he's actually a Celtic fan six years from now because we were saving two thousand thirty two caps space for him. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6807.84s)]
*  We want to be the first one who plays out his rookie contract and then just jumps to his favorite. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6813.84s)]
*  You can do the same thing. Maybe it can start to trend. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6818.84s)]
*  Convince him to do that for you. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6822.84s)]
*  Give me a Cooper story about what a what a over competitive maniac he is. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6824.84s)]
*  Yeah, I like this one just because it's the the first time we played pick up. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6830.84s)]
*  So we went down there a week before. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6836.84s)]
*  We actually had to go down there for the summer. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6840.84s)]
*  So there's this thing I do called K Academy. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6843.84s)]
*  A bunch of guys pay a whole bunch of money to get playing like a league. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6845.84s)]
*  Yeah, like a fantasy camp. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6850.84s)]
*  Basically. Right. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6853.84s)]
*  It's it's pretty cool. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6855.84s)]
*  But the guys are we're helping run it. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6856.84s)]
*  We're helping coach. And then and then after every day we play pick up. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6859.84s)]
*  So it's just like any other. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6863.84s)]
*  Any other pick up game guys are going really hard. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6866.84s)]
*  It's kind of our first time going against each other. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6870.84s)]
*  The coaches aren't in there, but you know, they got the cameras or whatever. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6872.84s)]
*  They can probably see a steer plan. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6875.84s)]
*  So everybody's going at each other and me and Cooper on the same team. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6877.84s)]
*  And we were winning every game. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6881.84s)]
*  It was it was really fun. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6885.84s)]
*  And then he switches teams. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6886.84s)]
*  And then that we played like three more games and that team won all three games. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6890.84s)]
*  Right. So it's just like that's just like any other game. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6894.84s)]
*  Like, doesn't matter. Middle school, high school, college. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6897.84s)]
*  The guy that does that is is the best player. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6900.84s)]
*  The guy that who wins all day switches teams and then wins wins three more games. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6903.84s)]
*  So I remember telling my dad, I'm like, yeah, he switched teams. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6909.84s)]
*  We were playing pick up and it didn't matter. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6913.84s)]
*  It didn't matter. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6916.84s)]
*  Is it is it weird to just pass through a school for. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6918.84s)]
*  Well, 10, 11 months and then you're gone and then for the rest of your life, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6924.84s)]
*  people are like Dukes, Khan, Knipple. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6928.84s)]
*  And it's like you were there for two semesters plus some summer games. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6930.84s)]
*  Right. It's it's just kind of weird how that's played out in the 21st century. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6934.84s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks because you get you get so close with all these teammates. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6938.84s)]
*  Yeah. And and you get close with the coaches. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6944.84s)]
*  You're with them all the time every day. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6947.84s)]
*  And then it's like, especially now with like the transfer portal, [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6949.84s)]
*  like right after the season, like we came home and the coaches are meeting [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6952.84s)]
*  with the guys who have like a decision to make as far as like, are you staying or leaving? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6957.84s)]
*  Yeah. So like they're doing that right away when they get back. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6961.84s)]
*  There's like no time for reflection. They're trying to get a roster together for next year. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6965.84s)]
*  You're not making s'mores by a campfire. Just talk. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6969.84s)]
*  It's just moving on. Reflecting on the season. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6972.84s)]
*  You just move on and it it kind of stinks. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6974.84s)]
*  And then like if you if you think like, oh man, I like I had so much fun this year. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6977.84s)]
*  You think about like, oh, like what would you do coming back? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6981.84s)]
*  And then it's just a completely different team anyway. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6985.84s)]
*  So it's never going to it's never going to be the same. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6988.84s)]
*  So you don't you don't really think about that for too long. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6990.84s)]
*  You're coming back and basically joining a different AAU team that has Duke jerseys and the same coaches. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=6994.84s)]
*  Yeah. They made me the czar sports and asked me to fix college hoops. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7000.84s)]
*  The natural fix would be if you go to any college you go to, you should have to stay for two years. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7006.84s)]
*  So there's at least a little more stability, right? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7011.84s)]
*  And that includes the coaches. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7013.84s)]
*  But I don't think somebody like you or Cooper or whoever else should be forced to stay in college for two years. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7015.84s)]
*  If you guys can become, you know, lottery picks or whatever, it's just you just never know with how long an athletic career could be. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7023.84s)]
*  So to to force somebody to stay isn't right either. I don't I don't know how you fix it. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7030.84s)]
*  It's one of those like unsolvable dilemmas, you know, and it feels like it's getting worse. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7034.84s)]
*  Yeah. And like we see too, with like all this stuff, the NCAA like can't can't fight anything. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7039.84s)]
*  So all everything that goes through is getting passed. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7046.84s)]
*  The coaches talk about all the time is it really is the Wild West. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7048.84s)]
*  Really? And especially the NIL stuff. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7053.84s)]
*  You're like an 18 year old kid navigating all these crazy offers. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7055.84s)]
*  What was the worst NIL offer you got? [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7058.84s)]
*  Sex toys? Anything terrible? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7064.84s)]
*  Yes. No, I don't know if I had a worst, a worst one. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7066.84s)]
*  How did people approach you? Did you have like a handler? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7073.84s)]
*  Or was it like your parents? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7077.84s)]
*  Yeah. So you can have you can have like an NIL agent. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7078.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7081.84s)]
*  So I had an agent. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7082.84s)]
*  Like I was born, like I didn't I didn't really care. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7085.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7088.84s)]
*  I just I just stuck with the money you get from the collective at whatever school you go to. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7089.84s)]
*  And I did a couple of things, but it was like the bare bones. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7093.84s)]
*  You take an Instagram, make an Instagram post, take one picture. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7096.84s)]
*  And then it's like whatever, whatever money you get. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7100.84s)]
*  So I wasn't really too too focused or big on it. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7103.84s)]
*  So I don't know if I had a worse, worse one. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7108.84s)]
*  Did you have who was like, did you were you in a suite? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7111.84s)]
*  Who were your roommates? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7114.84s)]
*  Like were you with the other basketball guys? What was the deal? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7116.84s)]
*  Yeah, we were in the dorm. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7119.84s)]
*  We were in dorms over on the East Campus at Duke, which is the freshman campus. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7121.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7126.84s)]
*  And we we got like a full room. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7127.84s)]
*  So most people would share one room. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7133.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7135.84s)]
*  And it's like I remember somebody was like, how come they get a full room? [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7136.84s)]
*  And like the the person we were moving in was like, because Kamon is seven foot two. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7139.84s)]
*  Not sleeping in like a twin bed or whatever. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7146.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7148.84s)]
*  So we we shared it was like Jack and Jill. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7149.84s)]
*  So it was like two rooms that were connected, shared a bathroom. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7153.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty pretty high level, but it was all on the freshman dorm. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7157.84s)]
*  It was super nice around all the other regular day to day students. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7161.84s)]
*  Season ends and you get exams and then that's it. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7165.84s)]
*  You never go back. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7168.84s)]
*  Some guys don't even do the exams. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7170.84s)]
*  The season ends and they're like, I'll see you a bit later. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7171.84s)]
*  Yeah. So I think I think Duke does it well because like we have we all [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7174.84s)]
*  have all in person classes. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7178.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7180.84s)]
*  So a lot of a lot of schools will just kids are just online and they're just clicking [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7181.84s)]
*  through. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7187.84s)]
*  I don't know. Someone's probably doing it doing it for them to like. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7190.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7193.84s)]
*  Like most most schools. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7194.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7195.84s)]
*  I shouldn't say I know everything, but like I know a lot of schools that do like they're [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7196.84s)]
*  done with school before the tournament. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7199.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7201.84s)]
*  So like you're done really. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7202.84s)]
*  You're not going to wear that at Duke. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7204.84s)]
*  Yeah, they don't go with class. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7206.84s)]
*  Go to class anyway. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7207.84s)]
*  So we're going to in person class. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7209.84s)]
*  So we we kind of stay. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7211.84s)]
*  We have to stay a little bit longer than probably some of their kids that declared for the [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7213.84s)]
*  draft. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7216.84s)]
*  Where did your parents want you to go to college? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7217.84s)]
*  My mom wanted me to go to Duke. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7220.84s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7222.84s)]
*  So they weren't like putting Wisconsin pressure on you or any of that stuff? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7223.84s)]
*  My dad, I think probably wanted Marquette. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7226.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7229.84s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7230.84s)]
*  But my mom was all the way in on Duke. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7231.84s)]
*  Is there a reason? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7232.84s)]
*  Would she make the Christian Leighton documentary? [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7234.84s)]
*  Like what was the reason? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7236.84s)]
*  No, I think she just she knew what how big like Duke is is is a brand college basketball [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7237.84s)]
*  and she was like, oh, you're going to play all the all the big games and all that. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7245.84s)]
*  And she was in for that. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7248.84s)]
*  She from anybody knows my mom at all. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7250.84s)]
*  She's all she's all in for that stuff. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7252.84s)]
*  Did she did you pick before or after Cooper picked? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7254.84s)]
*  Before. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7257.84s)]
*  Oh, so that's what a bonus. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7259.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was great. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7261.84s)]
*  I was I remember when it was coming down to it and it was them or us or you can and I was like, come on. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7262.84s)]
*  Like they just won twice. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7269.84s)]
*  I come on. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7271.84s)]
*  Let's like I wasn't I wasn't talking to him or anything like I was I only met him once, but I was like, oh man, this would be really, really good if he came here obviously. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7272.84s)]
*  And then I remember seeing it the slam thing or whatever in class in the morning. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7281.84s)]
*  I was like, let's go. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7286.84s)]
*  It's going to be awesome. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7287.84s)]
*  Well, you had a crazy class of I guess it's two thousand twenty four, but just like an unusually loaded class of dudes. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7289.84s)]
*  Like even if you go back and you look at the ESPN top hundred and like some of the guys are like five guys with ninety six ratings or above the two Rucker guys or Rutgers guys are in their edge comes in there. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7299.84s)]
*  And you probably have been playing against a bunch of these guys since what age like fifteen sixteen. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7311.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7316.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7317.84s)]
*  Once you get sophomore freshman sophomore year. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7318.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7320.84s)]
*  So what were your initial impressions of some of these dudes as you're like at these big tournaments and you know, it's like, oh, there's Dylan Harper. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7321.84s)]
*  I've heard about him. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7329.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7331.84s)]
*  So I played I think I played Dylan Harper once and we put him once. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7332.84s)]
*  So we actually we actually beat him and they ended up being really good and made the final four of like the Nike circuit. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7337.84s)]
*  But my team was my team was a team that I think we were five hundred. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7343.84s)]
*  But my team was a team like we'd be like a really good team like them and then go and lose to the worst team. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7348.84s)]
*  My my junior year we weren't very good, but I remember playing him. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7354.84s)]
*  Was there anybody that blew you away? [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7359.84s)]
*  I remember VJ like I saw VJ play at a camp and I'm like this guy just can fly like it was ever been really impressed with him. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7361.84s)]
*  Obviously, Cooper played against him a couple of times because he just has such a unique game. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7370.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7375.84s)]
*  We're like in high school, like he wasn't a great. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7376.84s)]
*  I think he got to the point at Duke where he was like a very good three point shooter. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7378.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7382.84s)]
*  But like he wasn't like a good shooter and like earlier in high school, like at least from three, it was like all mid range. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7383.84s)]
*  It was just like interesting to watch him play. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7391.84s)]
*  I'm like he's so effective. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7393.84s)]
*  He's can't even can't even shoot like that. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7394.84s)]
*  But he just had a create obviously the wingspan and all that. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7396.84s)]
*  It was just like a very interesting game. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7399.84s)]
*  High motor. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7401.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7402.84s)]
*  I did. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7403.84s)]
*  What about Ace Bailey? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7405.84s)]
*  Did you ever go against him? [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7406.84s)]
*  I never saw. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7407.84s)]
*  I never saw Ace Bailey. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7408.84s)]
*  I ever played against him because he was a I think he was an adidas. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7409.84s)]
*  He's an adidas circuit. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7414.84s)]
*  So you know, you don't really cross paths with guys. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7415.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7418.84s)]
*  It's so funny. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7419.84s)]
*  You have these circuits with the different shoes where you don't even see the guys. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7420.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7423.84s)]
*  It's definitely weird. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7424.84s)]
*  And it's all political too. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7426.84s)]
*  So, you know, they get they get pissed off about it, but I don't remember seeing him. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7427.84s)]
*  I remember Derek Queen. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7434.84s)]
*  Derek Queen was like at the camps, all the camps and stuff like. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7436.84s)]
*  It's hard to have a big like some teams don't have a big at these camps. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7440.84s)]
*  And so he like I remember we played him and he had most at 30 just like nobody could stop him. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7444.84s)]
*  He's really good. He's super skilled. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7449.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny at those can't add those camps are like just basically giant pickup games. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7451.84s)]
*  So the point guards always come out good because they have the ball at the time. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7456.84s)]
*  The shooters like you come out great because you're going to just hit open shots. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7459.84s)]
*  And then if there's a big guy who can wreak havoc, that's the other one who's going to jump out. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7463.84s)]
*  And then everybody else has to kind of figure out how to fit in and figure it right in the circumstances. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7467.84s)]
*  Yeah, they are. They aren't the best circumstances to for everybody. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7473.84s)]
*  But they're definitely you know, it's a different type of environment. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7478.84s)]
*  So I think that's actually the NBA 100 camp. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7482.84s)]
*  That's when Duke first saw me. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7485.84s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, those those things can actually can actually matter, which is weird because it's not always very good basketball. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7487.84s)]
*  So have you thought about like, well, what's the girlfriend situation? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7495.84s)]
*  Who's going to be at the draft with you? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7500.84s)]
*  What do you got going? Who's the entourage? [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7502.84s)]
*  Who do we have to look for? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7505.84s)]
*  Yeah, so I get six people at the table. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7507.84s)]
*  So that's my whole family. I have four little brothers. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7510.84s)]
*  Four little brothers? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7513.84s)]
*  Yeah. Oh my God. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7515.84s)]
*  Yep. All right. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7517.84s)]
*  Yeah. So that's the two parents. There you go. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7519.84s)]
*  Plus two parents. That's my table. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7522.84s)]
*  And then my cousin is coming. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7523.84s)]
*  My girlfriend, one of my best buddies from from the team at Duke and then my uncle who actually gave me your book for Christmas. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7527.84s)]
*  So I like that guy. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7533.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7535.84s)]
*  He actually played. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7536.84s)]
*  Yeah, he played in the NBA for a little bit. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7537.84s)]
*  Did he really? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7540.84s)]
*  Yeah. He appeared in 13 games for the Bucs. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7541.84s)]
*  He's got a basketball reference page. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7545.84s)]
*  Yeah. Jeff Nordgaard. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7547.84s)]
*  Wow. I vaguely remember that name. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7549.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7553.84s)]
*  But I have a weird brain. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7554.84s)]
*  Yeah. He was in the he likes to claim he's in he's in the 96 draft. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7556.84s)]
*  So he's like, I was part of the best draft class ever. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7560.84s)]
*  It's me. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7562.84s)]
*  That's what I said. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7563.84s)]
*  It's Kobe. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7564.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7565.84s)]
*  What's the situation? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7566.84s)]
*  Oh, I thought about it. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7569.84s)]
*  Thought about colors like that. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7570.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7572.84s)]
*  You're not that far away now. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7573.84s)]
*  Yeah. Navy blue suit. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7574.84s)]
*  I Navy tie white shirt. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7576.84s)]
*  I'm not. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7578.84s)]
*  That's not my cup of tea, really. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7579.84s)]
*  So I got a lot of help from my mom and from the agent and all of that. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7581.84s)]
*  But I'm not. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7585.84s)]
*  It won't seem like Grady Dick or anything. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7586.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was trying to make a statement. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7589.84s)]
*  So it's like you thought that looked good. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7591.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7593.84s)]
*  Maybe he stole this. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7594.84s)]
*  It seems like you're a giant basketball fan, though, which I feels like with NBA players, they go one of two ways either. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7596.84s)]
*  You know, they're in the league because they're good at basketball, but they don't really know what's going on. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7603.84s)]
*  And then there's other people who are like, no, no, I'm actually a student. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7607.84s)]
*  It's a it's a big deal for me to be playing against someone. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7610.84s)]
*  So I followed his whole career, but it seems like you're in that camp. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7612.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7615.84s)]
*  Like this this whole process here has been really awesome. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7617.84s)]
*  It's a you know, like my uncle is kind of a big influence and like he knows all these players and we used to talk about basketball all the time. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7619.84s)]
*  But this this process has been really cool because you're meeting all these former players. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7627.84s)]
*  Like when I was at the combine, I was in the elevator with like Brian Cardinal and I'm like, oh, this is awesome. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7633.84s)]
*  The janitor like this is stupid stuff like that. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7639.84s)]
*  Or like I was in my interview with OKC and Nick Collison's in there. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7643.84s)]
*  So it would be random guys like that. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7647.84s)]
*  That's really cool for me. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7649.84s)]
*  And then you obviously like the meeting meeting the all stars and like the guys have crossed paths with Duke is like Paulo and stuff like that is really cool. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7650.84s)]
*  But yeah, I just love hoops and it's been awesome to fall and all that all the NBA player stuff is something I've always gravitated towards. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7661.84s)]
*  Wait, so there was an interview with OKC that must have been before they didn't get the seventh pick. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7670.84s)]
*  Yes, well, the combine there's like you interview for like you're just talking to everybody. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7675.84s)]
*  Yeah, like 14 teams. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7682.84s)]
*  So they kind of request you and then it's both they request you before it's determined before the lottery. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7683.84s)]
*  Right. All right. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7690.84s)]
*  I'm not going to ask you what team you're rooting to get picked because the correct answer is it's just going to be great to be drafted. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7692.84s)]
*  I've always wanted to be in the NBA. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7700.84s)]
*  Any team will be awesome. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7703.84s)]
*  I love every American city. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7704.84s)]
*  Every city sounds great. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7708.84s)]
*  I love Charlotte. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7710.84s)]
*  It'd be great to be near Duke. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7711.84s)]
*  Washington. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7712.84s)]
*  I've always wanted to go there. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7713.84s)]
*  Utah looks awesome. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7715.84s)]
*  I'll take up skiing. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7716.84s)]
*  Yeah, you just go through them through them all. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7717.84s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely definitely can't give any leeway there. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7720.84s)]
*  But I personally I don't need to make this awkward, but I I personally think you make a ton of sense for Charlotte. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7724.84s)]
*  And I would be surprised if just for what they need if they're going to keep their their nucleus together. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7732.84s)]
*  I could just see you on that team. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7738.84s)]
*  But it's going to be you'll be somewhere in that three to seven. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7740.84s)]
*  I don't think it goes past seven would be my guess. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7743.84s)]
*  But all of those teams, I feel like you'd play for New Orleans might be the only weird one because they have a bunch of guards. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7746.84s)]
*  But you know, whatever, just keep working. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7752.84s)]
*  Rebound. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7757.84s)]
*  Don't forget to grab those rebounds. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7758.84s)]
*  Get in there. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7760.84s)]
*  Get pad the box score. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7761.84s)]
*  Yeah, keep keep. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7763.84s)]
*  I was I was mad this year. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7765.84s)]
*  I mean, like we got because I was I was obviously a good rebounder in high school. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7767.84s)]
*  I mean, it's easier when you're when you're a big guy. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7774.84s)]
*  But like I was I would always get pissed because we had C on James out there. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7776.84s)]
*  The six five. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7781.84s)]
*  He gets mad when everybody calls him a linebacker, but he's huge. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7782.84s)]
*  Yeah, he rebounds. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7785.84s)]
*  And then you got Cooper and come on. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7786.84s)]
*  It's like those guys steal everything. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7788.84s)]
*  There's none left. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7789.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I get four or whatever. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7790.84s)]
*  It's like, man, maybe I'd have six if Caleb Foster is in there and see, see, I'm as a. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7792.84s)]
*  You know, Caleb Foster was an L.A. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7799.84s)]
*  kid who I thought was awesome in high school. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7802.84s)]
*  And I still feel like I don't know, I'm holding my stock for him. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7804.84s)]
*  I still feel like you should something. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7809.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's something there with him. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7812.84s)]
*  He had some really, really good because that's what I'm talking about. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7814.84s)]
*  Really, really good because the L.A. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7817.84s)]
*  high school scene was crazy. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7818.84s)]
*  And, you know, that's where Jeremy came out of and a bunch of people. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7819.84s)]
*  But I thought I just thought he was really good in high school. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7822.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's a he's a super, super hard worker. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7826.84s)]
*  So I think you guys should expect big things from him this year. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7829.84s)]
*  He's a really, really good player, really good kid. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7834.84s)]
*  And so it says something about him coming back to you don't see that a lot. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7837.84s)]
*  You don't see that a lot anymore in college. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7840.84s)]
*  So I think I think I'll have a big year this year. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7842.84s)]
*  What's the coach K? [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7846.84s)]
*  How often does he kind of hang around the dude like that? [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7848.84s)]
*  Does he just show up randomly? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7851.84s)]
*  Like how many times did you interact with him? [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7853.84s)]
*  I interacted with him a little pretty decent amount, actually. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7856.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's awesome. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7860.84s)]
*  But he's not he tries to give like obviously the new staff is their space and whatever. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7862.84s)]
*  But he's up still on the sixth floor. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7869.84s)]
*  So there's six floors. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7872.84s)]
*  All the coaches are on the fifth floor and then he's got his office on the sixth floor over. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7873.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's pretty funny. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7879.84s)]
*  But yeah, he came to practice probably a couple of times. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7882.84s)]
*  He came he came and talked to us before the season. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7884.84s)]
*  But you'll see him in there getting his workout in doing his doing his dips and his pull ups. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7887.84s)]
*  But he's he's great. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7893.84s)]
*  He's he's super funny. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7894.84s)]
*  He's got a really dry sense of humor. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7896.84s)]
*  He'll drop some bombs every once in a while. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7899.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7901.84s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7902.84s)]
*  But he's he's great. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7904.84s)]
*  He's he's a good resource. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7906.84s)]
*  Obviously, he's one of the best resources to have for basketball stuff in the world. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7908.84s)]
*  Yeah, so I've enjoyed all my conversations that I got to have with him. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7912.84s)]
*  All right. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7917.84s)]
*  So big picture. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7918.84s)]

*  You want to stay out of all the blogs? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7928.84s)]
*  Just playing hard, making making shit happen, hitting some threes, no player podcast for at least two years. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7930.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not doing that. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7937.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7938.84s)]

*  Don't worry about that. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7940.84s)]
*  I like listening. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7941.84s)]
*  Yeah, you don't need to do maybe maybe much later in your career. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7942.84s)]
*  I'm trying to think what else. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7946.84s)]
*  Well, plus, it's going to take everybody like half a year to realize how to pronounce your name because you have like a deceiving name because it looks like it should be can up all but it's can nipple. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7947.84s)]
*  So you have a lot of mispronunciations coming out of the gate. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7956.84s)]
*  Then people get used to that. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7958.84s)]
*  But then I think the big moment will be when you go against clay. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7961.84s)]
*  And it like how that interaction goes. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7966.84s)]
*  Does he be like, hey, man, I've been following you. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7968.84s)]
*  Good luck, man. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7970.84s)]
*  You remind me a lot of me back in the day, like one of those to try to psych you out. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7971.84s)]
*  And then he'll put on like 20 on you in the first half. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7975.84s)]
*  In the first quarter, probably. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7978.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7980.84s)]
*  Try to rope a dope you with some sort of compliment. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7982.84s)]
*  And then, yeah, which which guy you're the most excited to go against just from like I'd grown up as a basketball fan, just being on the same court with somebody. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7984.84s)]
*  No, it's probably Steph or LeBron. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7993.84s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7995.84s)]
*  Yeah, like, like that's I mean, for me, that's like peak basketball. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=7997.84s)]
*  I'm in like middle school for those four finals in a row. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8002.84s)]
*  And that's like those are like when LeBron had the 20 whole 2018 run, even though they didn't have a chance. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8005.84s)]
*  Like he was awesome. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8011.84s)]
*  And then obviously the three one stuff. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8013.84s)]
*  But yeah, probably those guys. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8015.84s)]
*  And then Janice in there. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8017.84s)]
*  And I just want to see what it's like to play against Jokic to like how horrible that is. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8020.84s)]
*  Because he's I don't think it's fun. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8024.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8027.84s)]
*  I mean, he's just seems like he's the fact that he took OKC to seven. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8029.84s)]
*  Is incredible. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8034.84s)]
*  Like I just have after watching OKC in the Western Conference finals and so far in the finals, it's like, man, that guy is so good. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8036.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8043.84s)]
*  Well, what do you think Cooper on Dallas? [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8044.84s)]
*  Do you think that team can be good right away? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8046.84s)]
*  Like him and Davis Kyrie comes back. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8048.84s)]
*  Are you expecting them to be like immediately good? [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8050.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8054.84s)]
*  I because it'll be weird. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8056.84s)]
*  I mean, I don't know who's going to guard. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8058.84s)]
*  Like is Cooper getting the third best defender? [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8062.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8065.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8066.84s)]
*  Like that's a good, really good situation to come into as a rookie. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8067.84s)]
*  And I think it'll be able to let him have the ball in his. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8070.84s)]
*  Be able to play make and Kyrie is going to have the ball in his hands. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8073.84s)]
*  Davis is going to have the ball in his hands. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8078.84s)]
*  But I really think Cooper that'll be a really good spot for him right away, at least to be able to come in, contribute in a big way. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8080.84s)]
*  And then it'll be, I think it'll be on a good team. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8087.84s)]
*  Like that's where it's not just like empty calories for a team that isn't really maybe not going anywhere. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8090.84s)]
*  But I think I think that'll that'll fuel his fire. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8098.84s)]
*  You know, well, what's interesting is it's a it's a weird team for him, but not really because I feel like he actually could defend threes. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8101.84s)]
*  Like if they played him in the center and Davis all together, he could actually pull it off. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8110.84s)]
*  It doesn't seem like that would be the best way to use him, but he could definitely do it. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8114.84s)]
*  And now you have like all this size in a league where everybody's trying to go smaller. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8118.84s)]
*  And that would be like a bitch to play against when you think about it, especially if it's like it's lively. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8122.84s)]
*  Right. You know, like it's lively who can move. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8129.84s)]
*  A.D. can move. Yeah. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8132.84s)]
*  And Cooper obviously is super fluid. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8134.84s)]
*  So like I could have some like dangerous like switching. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8136.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8140.84s)]
*  Like it'll be very interesting to see. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8142.84s)]
*  Well, and then the stuff he started to do at Duke, even as the season went along where they were initiated in the offense through him and he was point forwarding, you know, some of these plays, which is basically what happened with Tatum with the Celtics over the course of they weren't doing that with him at all. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8144.84s)]
*  And around, you know, early 2020s, it started happening more. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8161.84s)]
*  And then by 22, he was really comfortable with it. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8166.84s)]
*  And it seems like Cooper was comfortable with it right away. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8169.84s)]
*  It's something, you know, that's going to be a next step for you to trying to figure out. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8172.84s)]
*  Can we run offense through him versus always having to run him off? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8176.84s)]
*  Right. Yeah, definitely. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8180.84s)]
*  I mean, as a player, you want to be able to contribute in as many facets of the game as you can. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8182.84s)]
*  But I think definitely for me going forward, like I played a lot in ball screens this year, but that's something I want to get get better at. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8187.84s)]
*  And for Cooper, for Cooper going forward, I think it's something that comes pretty naturally to him and it will be like you watch the Pacers. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8194.84s)]
*  They have so many guys that can initiate offense and that's what makes them so dangerous and how they can play so fast. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8201.84s)]
*  So I think that's probably where the game is going to keep going. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8206.84s)]
*  Yeah, I do feel like it's some new version of basketball. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8209.84s)]
*  I was thinking that when I was it, nobody had the ball for too long. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8213.84s)]
*  Everybody was cutting and moving and multiple guys on each team were trying to create plays like as the initiator versus like the basketball we've had forever where it's one guy, everybody stands around. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8218.84s)]
*  One guy won't come one pick up. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8230.84s)]
*  Play back and everybody down. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8232.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8234.84s)]
*  Three guys are just standing in their spots and it feels like this is a more fun version. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8235.84s)]
*  I don't know how many teams are going to be able to play that style, but we'll see. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8240.84s)]
*  All right. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8244.84s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you have a good head on your shoulders. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8245.84s)]
*  I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad we'll put that picture on social you read in my book when you were a kid because that really cracked me up. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8247.84s)]
*  That book has some inappropriate words and jokes in there. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8254.84s)]
*  So I'm glad I was able to corrupt you. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8257.84s)]
*  It definitely does. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8260.84s)]
*  It's probably not for the 10 year old years or whatever. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8261.84s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8264.84s)]
*  But I'm glad, especially with all the pop culture references and that stuff. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8265.84s)]
*  That's up to me and my dad's favorite is the rewatchable. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8270.84s)]
*  So good. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8273.84s)]
*  What was your favorite episode? [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8274.84s)]
*  Or did you have like a favorite movie we did? [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8276.84s)]
*  I mean, I really enjoyed Kyle Branson with you. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8281.84s)]
*  So I probably said Rudy. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8285.84s)]
*  The Rudy episode because that's one of my favorites. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8287.84s)]
*  Oh, good. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8290.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, my dad, my dad's listening to all the time like he goes, whatever he's doing yard work, getting some shots up or something. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8292.84s)]
*  He's got the headphones and listening to the rewatchables. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8298.84s)]
*  Oh, that's great to hear. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8301.84s)]
*  Tell him thank you. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8302.84s)]
*  Good luck. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8304.84s)]
*  I hope you I hope wherever you land, I'm sure it's going to work out. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8305.84s)]
*  But I hope it would be fun to see you on a team where you could contribute and play right away and, you know, keep keep working your ass off. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8308.84s)]
*  But thanks for coming on the arm room for you. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8316.84s)]
*  Yeah, I really appreciate it. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4yZZQkY-w&t=8319.84s)]
