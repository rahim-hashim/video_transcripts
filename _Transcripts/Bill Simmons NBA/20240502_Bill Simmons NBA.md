# NBA Knicks Vs. 76ers Game 6 LIVE Reaction with Bill Simmons and Rob Mahoney
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAgd4UrEfz8)
*  and then you watch a game like tonight and LeBron kicked his ass.
*  He's not ready to be a top 15 guy.
*  He really, really, really gives a shit about every game.
*  It's great. I love it.
*  This is a long, sustained offensive excellence
*  that when you watch it feels legitimate.
*  We're not going to be nice.
*  What do we care?
*  We're just these.
*  Let's call it what it is.
*  All right, we're taping this.
*  It is 847 p.m. Pacific Time.
*  Good to know.
*  That's that's when my soul left my body, Bill.
*  I'm glad we have a timestamp on it.
*  Nick Sixers, not a series for the faint of heart.
*  We're doing this live on YouTube.
*  I needed time to regroup, but we told people we're going live.
*  So let's do it.
*  The Jalen Brunson series.
*  We start there.
*  It's good to see the greatest Nick of all time at what's basically the ground floor.
*  I'm glad we get to be here for this.
*  New York City hoops, God summons the ghost,
*  even though he's still alive, of Bernard King 40 years ago,
*  who had the greatest two series stretch in the recent history.
*  The New York Knicks Brunson goes, he goes 22 and 24.
*  The first two games and then 39, 47, 40, 41, which is outrageous.
*  And there was a moment in this game when it felt like Philly was going to come back
*  and win when they had the little seven point run there.
*  And it felt chaotic again.
*  And the crowd was into it.
*  Brunson calm things down.
*  He made a big shot, missed the foul shot.
*  But I felt like that stem that tied.
*  But he was the best part of the series.
*  And usually that's the rule.
*  Best part in the series wins the series.
*  I don't know how to feel about the in-beat piece of this,
*  because on the one hand, he was good tonight.
*  Thirty nine points imposed as well.
*  Sixteen points in the third quarter.
*  On the other hand, as was the pattern, kind of stunk in the fourth quarter.
*  They didn't really do very much and then fouled out.
*  This was definitely the piece of complicating evidence for the mounting noise about,
*  oh, give more of the offensive Tyrese Maxey,
*  even even more leeway for this electric scoring guard we have.
*  I thought in the first half, especially and particularly in the first quarter,
*  you saw the real limitations of Maxey as a playmaker.
*  He looked just dazed with all the activity that was going on defensively.
*  And Joel was the only reason the Sixers got back in this game.
*  I know they may have run without him playing small, but he stabilized them.
*  And he's the one who really reversed the energy of it
*  to that feeling of inevitability, where for a long stretch,
*  the Knicks could not guard him one on one.
*  And when they tried to double him,
*  Buddy Heald came out of nowhere to hit every three from the weak side corner.
*  The way all of those pieces kind of interlocked, I mean, Joel was sensational.
*  And I think the inevitability that he was playing with for the vast majority
*  of this game was really impressive.
*  He does wear out by the end, though, and especially when you have guys
*  who can't get him timely entry passes and guys who can't properly space for him.
*  And I thought the Knicks, to their credit, were junking up their coverages
*  just enough where when he caught the ball in by the fourth quarter, at least,
*  he couldn't be 100 percent sure whether it was going to be a single or a double
*  or kind of a shading zone.
*  It was mixed up just enough to keep him guessing.
*  I'm glad you mentioned that, because I noticed that it reminded me of in football
*  when they start trying to mess with the quarterback and their show blitz one time.
*  They don't blitz, then they send a blitz.
*  And they basically for the first three quarters, it felt like
*  they were just conventional, right?
*  We don't want to give up any threes.
*  You do what you got to do, Joel.
*  And he was he was burning them.
*  Then get to the fourth quarter.
*  Now, all of a sudden, the second guy had to know where pretending to send
*  the second guy, but then come in.
*  And it did feel like it screwed him up.
*  There were moments when it just didn't seem like he wanted to shoot
*  in the last five minutes. You notice that?
*  Like he was passing up foul on jumpers.
*  He was kind of hot potatoing it at the top of the key.
*  And he also looks super tired to me.
*  And that's one of the things.
*  I mean, this is such a weird series.
*  And I think we'll remember it as a really, really, really, really fun.
*  I won't think I don't think we'll call it the greatest first round series
*  ever, anything like that, but a super fun first round series.
*  Absolutely.
*  One of the things I'll always wonder about it is why they never figured out
*  how to pace and be so that he was peeking at the right times of the game,
*  because he clearly had about what do you think?
*  Twenty nine to 30 good minutes in him every game.
*  And maybe they maybe Nick Nurse felt like they just couldn't survive it.
*  But he always felt to me like this car that was like,
*  you know, when you're trying to get to a gas station,
*  you don't want to get off the highway.
*  No, there's a gas station 13 miles away.
*  I think we could make it. Yeah.
*  That was Nick Nurse's strategy for this entire series.
*  I think we can make it. I think there's no, no, there's a gas station down there
*  with the Chick-fil-A and just wait, wait, wait.
*  We're going to get there.
*  And then then you break down on this side of the road.
*  This has always been the Nick Nurse school is let's just add five more minutes
*  to that guy's workload.
*  Let's just keep pressing a little bit more and see if it works and see if it works.
*  And it's going against him.
*  Who's also like, oh, no, hold my beer.
*  I appreciate the commitment to endurance on all sides.
*  But I think contributing to that and the Nick Nurse
*  dilemma as far as when to pull Joey Joe Embiid and how to format the lineups
*  to best accommodate that every time he steps on the floor feels incredibly precarious.
*  And there were there were like five players in this game for whom it felt that way.
*  You know, the thought of, you know, especially when Joel was roasting
*  Isaiah Hardenstein, the thought of taking Mitchell Robinson off the floor
*  felt dangerous for the Knicks, obviously every minute that Jalen Brunson sits.
*  But that was the determining difference.
*  I thought in the mid fourth quarter, the Knicks bought like two minutes
*  for Jalen Brunson to sit. Yep.
*  And he comes back in and he makes everything happen.
*  And Joel just didn't really have that kind of finishing first.
*  And they got a big three from Josh Hart at the perfect time.
*  Oh, amazing.
*  I think 25 seconds left to go up by three.
*  And they figured out actually what to do in the last 10 seconds to protect the lead.
*  Yes. Hey, use your fouls.
*  Hey, maybe cut off Tyrese Maxey so he doesn't have a full start.
*  So they actually learn from some of their mistakes.
*  When when you think of like we're.
*  Heading into like the fourth quarter and I was taking notes.
*  I thought Philly was going to win.
*  It was tied going into the fourth.
*  I just felt like this is going to be Philly's game.
*  So I'm kind of taking notes, but my notes are a little slanted toward Philly's
*  going to win Game seven and where we go and who's going to have enough left in the tank.
*  What's that crowd going to be like?
*  Yep. And then all of a sudden, the Knicks were up by like,
*  you know, halfway through all of a sudden, they're up seven.
*  It was like, oh, man, the Knicks, this series had so many different
*  swings back and forth, I almost couldn't keep track.
*  Ultimately, though, how good are these teams?
*  It's a great like, like, hey,
*  because we're going to watch Minnesota, Denver on Saturday night. Yeah.
*  And I think the quality of basketball in that series versus what we just watched,
*  where we're going to have size, we're going to have scoring.
*  We're going to play making.
*  We're going to have guys up the bench who can actually come in and affect games.
*  We're going to have teams with real identities.
*  We're going to have teams that can protect the rim.
*  And I just think like this was a super fun series,
*  but it feels a little like the JV to me.
*  But it's two JV teams that are so evenly matched
*  and know how to fight.
*  And that's that's the important thing at the end of the day.
*  It's doing a great series anywhere in the bracket.
*  It just has to be the right matchup.
*  And this was that neither of these teams are as good as Minnesota,
*  much less as good as a defending champion like Denver.
*  And that's OK. They're both pretty banged up.
*  They're both playing to the absolute limit, balls to the wall.
*  And the chaos was just off the charts.
*  Like this the series did only have like one setting on the dial.
*  And it was insane all the time.
*  To the point, guys, like guys falling everywhere, everywhere.
*  And to the point, as you mentioned, like the Knicks being buttoned up
*  for the final 30 seconds of this game felt shocking.
*  I'm I'm generally genuinely like jarred that nothing weird happened
*  because I'm so conditioned to everything weird happening
*  all the time with these two teams.
*  And it never felt like whoever was up was going to make the two free throws.
*  It just felt like the other team was always hanging around.
*  Unfortunately, for Maxi, who had one of the great,
*  you know, memorable random playoff games in Game five
*  in the seven pointer on two possessions.
*  And, you know, now this is what happens.
*  I talked about this in my pod on Tuesday night.
*  You lose the next game in those games, kind of.
*  They just kind of fade away a little bit.
*  Still really fun.
*  I remember that one, but it's loses like what?
*  90 percent of the meeting.
*  A lot of it felt really fun, but not the same.
*  And he wasn't good tonight was the other piece.
*  And there were reasons for that.
*  They definitely changed what they're doing defensively on him.
*  I also think it's really hard to just have two incredible games in a row
*  as James Harden and Paul George can tell us.
*  And he almost pulled it out, too.
*  You know, as far as all of the closing plays, as we're mentioning,
*  they weren't really coming from Joel Embiid, although he was setting screens.
*  He was involved.
*  But Maxi converting a layup in which his body was fully paralleled to the ground
*  and then following it up with that and one goaltend.
*  I mean, if anyone was going to close it, it was going to be him.
*  And, you know, in all due respect, Kelly Ubre, who came up with
*  sensational plays throughout this game, I was kind of flagging them
*  as I was going to almost expecting the Sixers to win at various points.
*  Once they started, once they came back from that initial,
*  it was like they were down 19 after eight minutes.
*  But once they started whittling that down, I started flagging plays.
*  And one of them was Kelly Ubre's chase down block on Oji and Inobi
*  just completely saved a play out of nowhere.
*  And I think you could do the same thing in the opposite direction with OJ's
*  and one on Joel in the fourth quarter passing up a wide open three
*  to drive in and finish incredible play made by him.
*  But then you mark it going down the other way because he missed the free throw.
*  And it's like there's just constant toggling of these hugely momentous plays.
*  And I thought this series was a great reminder in these playoffs in general.
*  All the offense is great.
*  But what makes offense cool is defense.
*  It's like games that are this tight where every three
*  feels like the biggest shot in the world.
*  And that's where we want to be in this kind of playoff basketball.
*  The biggest thing for the Knicks tonight, they knew it there again for Brunson.
*  But I thought D.
*  Fincenzo, who ended up that he is that say 48 minutes and 40, it's 46 or 48.
*  I can't see.
*  Uh, he had 23.
*  He finally got going.
*  That was the thing in the first five games.
*  It just didn't look like him.
*  Fantasy said that on the pod on Tuesday night, he'd been their second best player
*  for the last two months of the season and he was kind of MIA.
*  And I think he knew it.
*  He came out, came out hot.
*  He made a couple of big shots early on when they built that lead.
*  He made a couple of big shots late.
*  His defense was there.
*  He was scrappy.
*  It just looked like him again.
*  So they had him going.
*  I thought OG had another good game.
*  They feel like a guy short to me if they're going to keep climbing,
*  you know, rounds next round.
*  Is it the matter?
*  Is it the 48 minutes for Dante or the 46 for Josh Harder, the 45 for OG?
*  That makes you think they might need one more guy.
*  Are they playing Sunday?
*  Is there, is this?
*  I hope not.
*  Oh my God.
*  Let's just pack them like a movable sauna truck and just keep them in there
*  a full stop as they head back.
*  Like we got to get these guys some kind of recovery.
*  Oh, they got it.
*  So Monday night is the first game.
*  That's good for them.
*  OK, good little, little time, little time to to to recoup for these.
*  At these paces of these games, you're not meant to play 45 minutes.
*  No, that's that's just crazy.
*  Plus, like the way guys were flying around.
*  And there was at least 10 times in the series where somebody was down.
*  I was like, that guy's out for the series.
*  We're not going to see him again.
*  Walk me through where Philly is mentally right now.
*  The fan base, the organization.
*  Yeah.
*  And Bede was healthy enough, right?
*  I, I, you know, it's like, oh yeah, he wasn't 100%.
*  I guess my question would be, is he ever going to be 100%?
*  Is this somebody who's meant to play eight months of basketball each year?
*  Is it bad luck?
*  Is it something else?
*  He seemed exhausted near the end of every one of these games.
*  I don't know from a physical shape standpoint.
*  I wouldn't say he was an A plus.
*  He was doing enough.
*  He was still impactful.
*  It's going to be 31 next year.
*  There's the Met.
*  There's I think the Sixers fans are like, we would love for this to be Maxis team too.
*  I don't know how that plays out.
*  They're going to probably lose Ubre.
*  My guess that he'll, especially with, uh, all the teams that have cap
*  space and the lack of free agents.
*  They have cap space.
*  There's been Paul George rumors.
*  I don't know why Paul George would not go to Orlando over Philly by the choice.
*  And I'm just betting on a team.
*  I'm betting on Orlando over Philly.
*  That's just me.
*  Wow.
*  Um, not a lot of guys left and it's just like, this is now year 10 of the NB era
*  and they've never made a conference finals.
*  So what, how do you even react to this series?
*  What's your takeaway?
*  If you're like the advisor to the Philly owners.
*  I don't know that you have a choice if you're Philly, but to stay the course
*  on Joel and making it the best team you can every time out.
*  And obviously Max needs to be a huge part of that.
*  I personally would love Paul George as a fit there.
*  And if I'm Paul George, I would love the fit there.
*  I think in terms of what PG would want playing in between an MVP kind of player
*  and a young ascendant star takes a lot of heat off of him, lets him play a much
*  more comfortable role, both on and off the ball and where he can be an impact
*  defensive player again on the perimeter on a really consistent basis.
*  I think that could be an ideal spot for him.
*  And if you can land a player like that, everything changes pretty quickly.
*  Will you worry about, can I zag on that for a second?
*  Let's talk it through.
*  It's from LA or LA area.
*  Yeah.
*  Comes back, wanted to be here.
*  Everyone thought he wanted to be in the Lakers ends up on the Quippers, but he's
*  in LA now you're asking to leave LA again.
*  He's going to go back to the now he's going to the East coast, which he's
*  never gone that far.
*  The reason to leave would be, I can't take this Kawhi thing anymore.
*  I can't do it.
*  This has been a half a decade of never knowing if this fucking guy is playing or
*  not.
*  And I just want to be on a good team that has some regularity to it.
*  So you're going to go cross country and play with Joel Embiid.
*  Do you, do you feel like you're doing some self projection as East coast guy
*  moves to LA and never leaves again?
*  No, you're, you're entrenched.
*  I'm just like, if I'm going to have uncertainty, I might as well stay in LA.
*  It's fair.
*  Like if you're going to talk me into Orlando and Palo, who's like a shooting
*  star upwards and cap space and a young team and defense and a team that really
*  needs what he can do.
*  If I'm leaving the Quippers, I'm leaving for that.
*  And I don't care where he goes.
*  Like either way, they're going to be a competitor for the Celtics, but to go to
*  Philly and be in the same kind of is he playing or isn't he playing situation?
*  I don't know why he would do that.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's with Orlando.
*  It's a matter of how close do you think that team is and how much do you think
*  their current problems are spacing mechanical problems versus decision-making
*  young player problems.
*  And I think it's a combination of both, but if you're Paul George, 34 years old,
*  you're kind of picking your shot right now.
*  Like this next team is going to be the team that's going to give you a chance to
*  potentially contend for a title.
*  And if, if you want to chill with the Clippers and enjoy all of that entails
*  power to you, but I think Philly could give him, if not his best, then close to
*  his best chance to actually contend for something.
*  This message was presented by Darrell Mori.
*  You know what?
*  I was at the Quipper game last night and they do the rosters and it's like,
*  blah, blah, blah.
*  And his 12th year.
*  So they get to Paul George and I've been a bunch of Quipper games.
*  I just never noticed this before.
*  They're like in his 14th season.
*  I'm like, Oh my God, Paul George, 14 seasons already.
*  Cause you think of them as like this run of a young guy.
*  He looks the same, but so this next contract will be years 15, 16, 17, 18.
*  Huge.
*  And he's got a metal rod in his leg and you know, he's had some other injuries.
*  I don't know.
*  I didn't make me think like he's probably taken one last big ass contract.
*  I don't know what happens with the Embiid piece of it.
*  Where what happens if, if he's like, you know what?
*  Maybe it's time.
*  Maybe it's time, maybe it's time for me to move on.
*  Maybe it's time for me to get a fresh start.
*  What happens if the Sixers get a little aggressive with him?
*  Like, Hey, we need to be in better shape, dude.
*  Like you can't play yourself, self in a shape during the season.
*  You have a lot of miles on you.
*  You've had a lot of different injuries.
*  We really want you to dedicate.
*  We don't think you should play team USA.
*  Well, I want to play team USA or to give my word.
*  Like there's ways this could go wrong.
*  And then the, the Darrell Mori piece, what happens there?
*  How many, how many years does he get?
*  Do they start looking at him side at it a little bit?
*  Like they just made all these moves.
*  They traded James Harden.
*  Didn't really get a lot back.
*  Not that if you watched them last night, you would be amazing.
*  Got anything back, but do they start wondering like, is his vision the right vision?
*  All fair questions.
*  I think as far as the moves that they made with what they had,
*  Uber is a great example.
*  That's a, that's a home run signing given, given the financial investment.
*  Kyle Lowry, a non-factor in this game, but has been meaningful in others.
*  And that's a pickup, a marginal pickup along the margins, a marginal
*  pickup along the edges of the.
*  Yeah.
*  For a bar for this cost us nothing.
*  That's about as well as you can do certainly better than why Donavich now.
*  It works.
*  Yeah.
*  And if the Anthony Melton had been consistently healthy, maybe that would
*  have made this team look a little different in terms of its perimeter rotation too.
*  Maybe you're not begging on a prayer from buddy healed and campaign to save
*  you in some of these games, but that's where they found themselves.
*  And those guys did deliver moments, not consistently enough, but they did.
*  All right.
*  I think the problem with them is more like you look real sideways at
*  Tobias Harris as Billy fans have for a very long time, but as vacant and
*  invisible as you could possibly be in a game in which he played 29 minutes and
*  basically had to play 29 minutes.
*  And that's the spot where, whether you're talking about Paul George or anyone else,
*  they just have to get some flexible forward size that makes sense next to
*  Joel that is not Tobias Harris.
*  Do you think they could have gotten Bradley Beal last summer straight up for
*  Tobias Harris as an expiring and would you have done that?
*  And was that a mistake or was that a great move not to do that?
*  I think it's a great move not to do it.
*  I mean, how bad is that for Bradley Beal?
*  And we're not having this conversation about could they get Paul George if you
*  make the trade for Bradley Beal's non-tradable contract, right?
*  You're locking yourself into that massive number when the Sixers are one of the few
*  teams that are going to play the cap space game a little bit.
*  And that is, that's an actual asset for them.
*  Well, they could have gone after Siakam.
*  Yeah.
*  The Knicks also could have gotten Siakam and we're going to talk about
*  Indiana in the next segment, but both of the Knicks, I think we're like, you
*  know what, we're not close to winning a title.
*  OG was our big move.
*  These are baby steps.
*  We're going to wait for the, for the big fish next summer.
*  Well, plus with all due respect, you've seen OG and Siakam together, right?
*  You know what that is.
*  Maybe they picked the one and two.
*  Philly could have at least matched what Indiana gave up for Siakam.
*  Maybe they, you know, Indiana gave up a pick this year for Siakam, but this is
*  probably the worst draft in 11 years.
*  So I, if they had been future picks, maybe that would have been even more
*  desirable for Toronto anyway, but, uh, I was just thinking about it.
*  Cause Siakam was good in that Milwaukee series and it was, it was funny that we
*  were all looking at that trade when it happened and like, yeah, Siakam good
*  player.
*  And then meanwhile, we do the ringer a hundred rankings and he's always, I
*  forget where he is, but he's always somewhere in the forties, low fifties.
*  Right.
*  And it's like, you know what, when it's nice to have a guy like Siakam,
*  yeah, don't look at me for you.
*  Don't look at me on that.
*  I'm, I'm in those meetings, stumping for Pascal, Pascal Siakam with a sandwich
*  sign on doing spin moves, trying to get it moved up the ranking a little bit.
*  But sometimes it falls on deaf ears.
*  Well, the segment that I was most excited to do for this part was, uh,
*  quickie pressure rankings for game seven, but there will be no game seven.
*  And no pressure at all.
*  It turns out.
*  And we should mention from, uh, you know, the fan bases, the psyches of these two
*  fan bases was one of the most fun parts of the series.
*  And you might've heard fantasy on here on Tuesday, having like an actual mental
*  breakdown, uh, the Philly fans are an all time mess.
*  They don't know what to make of the future of this team.
*  How do we feel about Joel?
*  There's camps forming and, uh, and then the way this played out, where are we
*  going?
*  What did we just do with the last 10 years of our lives?
*  All of those questions are in play.
*  The Knicks fans were going to a dark place if they blew this game tonight.
*  I think that if that had been a game seven with them blowing big leads in game
*  six and then blowing game five, the way they did that game seven would have been
*  one of the most fascinating first round game sevens, but we'll never know.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you think Sixers fans are going to deal with in retrospect, the game five
*  miracle, the kind of miracle that the Sixers never get and have never really
*  gotten in the Joel era for the most part, every bad break is pretty much turned
*  against them and yet they get this one and it goes absolutely nowhere and fizzles
*  out basically immediately.
*  That's, that's gotta be tough.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's that the dark side of you, if you're a Sixers fan or it's like,
*  maybe if that didn't happen, maybe some tougher conversations could have then
*  happened.
*  Instead we bought some hope.
*  I just don't know where you are with this and be thing.
*  If you're trying to win a title with all the miles that he has, the surgeries that
*  he's had already, how we've seen these games go, what we've seen in the fourth
*  quarters from him, how this is going to get better and keep at like, this is what
*  I talked to my Philly fan friends about all of them are like, love Joel, like
*  watching him.
*  He's definitely one of the best players in the league.
*  I don't know how this gets better when he's 31, 32, 33, especially if you look at
*  the history of centers too.
*  Wings wings can age the best.
*  Some point guards age really well.
*  Centers usually don't age well.
*  Centers stay, you know, year 10 through year 13, it starts to flip and you can
*  look at any great center and it starts to flip the knees.
*  They just have a lot of weight and a lot of, you know, a lot of inches.
*  It's like a big building.
*  And, uh, that would be what I would be thinking about this summer.
*  And I'd be absolutely furious if you play team USA, if I was the Philly owner or if
*  I was a Philly fan, like what the fuck are you playing team USA for?
*  Take the summer off, get healthy, get your needs healthy.
*  He should honestly like, and Kawhi too, Kawhi just bow out.
*  You can't even play for the Clippers bow out, get out of team USA.
*  You're done.
*  It's a very anti-American stance from you, Bill.
*  Uh, you know, I want to win the gold medal.
*  Our boys and boys are trying to win us over there.
*  Come on.
*  Yeah.
*  Get Shailen Brunson on that team.
*  I will say what the Sixers have needed.
*  And it's weird because they, they tried this with the very wretched and
*  cursed Al Horford experiment, but they needed a player all along who could keep
*  Joel's minutes down and control his exposure in some of these games.
*  And they needed it cheap.
*  They needed Isaiah Hartenstein effectively, right?
*  Like they needed that kind of discovery, that kind of find a guy who could really
*  plug in and make the no Joel minutes, something other than an abject disaster
*  all the time and they've never ever found it.
*  And as this series illuminated, Paul Reed is not the answer.
*  You basically unplayable by the end of the series.
*  Well, the irony of you laying that out was they had a chance to just not keep Paul
*  Reed, what was it Utah made like a poison pill offer for him.
*  Yeah.
*  Billy to match it.
*  He became untradable and they decided to keep the asset over just letting him go.
*  And then he gets to the playoffs and you can't play him too bad.
*  I don't know if we can call him playoff P anymore.
*  Was that his nickname?
*  Paul Reed, Bebop, Paul.
*  Come on.
*  But what about play up?
*  He's put playoff piece.
*  Paul George.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is live on YouTube.
*  You get to see my sonality.
*  Who will never confuse it from playoff.
*  He would have been a better joke.
*  Kyle, edit that out of the YouTube.
*  Oh no, you can't.
*  Let's let's take a break on YouTube really quick and on the podcast and we'll come
*  right back and we're back on YouTube.
*  OK.
*  Um, I want to talk about Indiana because they clinched tonight.
*  They beat Milwaukee.
*  They knew it.
*  I thought I would say, let's talk about Milwaukee.
*  Oh my God.
*  Indiana feel good.
*  Feel good.
*  Mid-market story.
*  Absolutely.
*  They have Paul George doesn't want to be there anymore.
*  They turn him into Oladipo and sub bonus.
*  They get real all star years out of old people before he gets hurt.
*  So bonus turns into an asset.
*  They turn sub bonus into Halliburton who becomes a possible NBA guy.
*  They trade picks for Siakam really smart trade.
*  They have this Malcolm Brogdon piece.
*  Doesn't really totally fit with how, with Halliburton.
*  They want to turn the team over to them.
*  They turned him into Aaron Neesmith.
*  They go discount shopping.
*  Then they get TJ McConnell.
*  They get OB Toppin basically for nothing.
*  Everyone waits for them to trade miles Turner and buddy heel to the Lakers or just
*  trade miles Turner.
*  They say, you know what?
*  We're actually going to keep miles Turner.
*  We like the way he plays with T with, uh, with Tyrese Albert and now they're in
*  the second round of the playoffs and they wax this no Yanis Milwaukee team, which
*  was even without Yanis pretty expensive.
*  Um, and now they're playing the Knicks in round two and we're going to be treated
*  to just a slew of Reggie Miller, Spike Lee, uh, nineties four point shot.
*  We're going to get all of that stuff and it's going to be great.
*  But, uh, can you think, is this the biggest success story of the season two Indiana?
*  Or would you go another team?
*  Organizational, what our expectations were?
*  Yeah, I think organizationally, it feels like a huge one.
*  This was a team that I think seeing them make the next step was seeing them secure
*  even a playoff seed, like the one they had, right?
*  Get to the top six.
*  That's an achievement.
*  Get through a series like this, even without Yanis, even with Dame injured for
*  part of, well injured for all of it, but out for part of it.
*  So an incredible achievement.
*  Most importantly, I think if you eat, you know, there's a lot of ups and downs
*  clearly for Indiana and the execution in some of these games.
*  But if you look at game one and game six, those are very, very different teams
*  that Indiana put on the floor.
*  That's a team that grew up in their first playoff experience.
*  And that's really all you want from this sort of series.
*  Obviously you want to advance.
*  You want to do the best you can with the opportunity in front of you, but you want
*  to see these young guys figure it out.
*  And they absolutely did.
*  I thought Tyrese Halliburton in particular, even just seeing him like attack the
*  basket a little more in this closeout game.
*  It's like maybe three games too late, but a relief to see.
*  Yeah.
*  And they, I mean, McConnell was great.
*  Oh yeah.
*  41 from McConnell on top end.
*  And this was, this is where the Yanis piece both I think matters and does
*  the matter Milwaukee couldn't guard anybody's point guard the whole season.
*  No.
*  And Indiana was always a bad matchup for them and could just send these guards
*  just constantly just flying by people getting into the paint, make it stuff happen.
*  I gotta be honest.
*  I think Indiana would have beaten Milwaukee with or without Yanis.
*  I did in the regular season, as you said, pretty soundly.
*  Every time I really do.
*  I think they would have won.
*  I thought that Milwaukee team was really suspect.
*  I thought they were old.
*  I thought they were unathletic.
*  Um, I don't think they ever figured out the wings at all.
*  And somebody like Siakam was just feasting on every wing they had because
*  they just weren't athletic enough.
*  And then you could say, well, Dame was a little hurt.
*  Look, man, when you're trading for super expensive superstars and they're past
*  the age of 32, 33, 34, this is what fucking happens.
*  It's not like bad luck that Dame got hurt.
*  He's old.
*  It's not bad luck that James Harden sucked last night.
*  He's old.
*  James Harden is going to play well once a week.
*  This is what happens when guys get into their mid thirties with the exception of
*  LeBron James, who could play 44 minutes in altitude in Denver and game five.
*  Um, and he's, you know, in year 21, so we'll put him to the side, but for the
*  most part, older players are up and down.
*  And this was one of the reasons I didn't like the Dame trade that much for what
*  they gave up, cause I'm like, he's maybe he's moving into a different point of
*  his career and I think he is.
*  Yeah.
*  He looks awesome on certain nights.
*  But when you think about like Anthony Edwards, the stage of the
*  career that he's at age 22, I don't know what I'm getting from.
*  Maybe he'll go six for 17, six for 18, but I know what I'm getting from an
*  athleticism intensity, um, going up and down, um, durability he's going to be in
*  every game and that's the difference when you're talking about guys in their
*  mid twenties versus a guy at Dames age.
*  So I feel like you can't use that as an excuse.
*  That's what you traded for.
*  It doesn't feel like a coincidence that the guys who roasted the bucks in this
*  game are hyperactive, TJ McConnell, hyperathletic, OB Toppin, everyone who
*  was running full court, everyone who was attacking relentlessly.
*  I think the fluke, as far as the bad luck is Yannis, that him getting hurt is the
*  part of it that is unpredictable and maybe somewhat rooted in how bad the
*  bucks were in the regular season and how hard he had to go all the time to try to
*  correct it.
*  They do have this thing where they are so old and they're so slow.
*  And this was always like a talking point around the Steph Clay Warriors too, where
*  obviously one of the great shooting teams of all time because of those two
*  guys, but if you look elsewhere, there really weren't a lot of great shooters on
*  those teams otherwise.
*  And the bucks are kind of the same way, but with athleticism with Yannis where
*  he's on the floor, they're dynamic, they're energetic, they have a lot of
*  different ways they can play.
*  You take him out and it's three pretty old court players, all of whom I will say
*  like showed up in the series to the degrees that they could between Dame and
*  Chris Middleton and Brook Lopez.
*  They did their best, but at that age, like you're running a little bit too much
*  risk on guys who throw their back out with a sneeze, you know, like that's kind
*  of where your team is hanging at this point.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm glad you mentioned that about Yannis cause he had bad luck here at his
*  calf, but if you watch the bucks all season, everything he had to do for this
*  team night after night and how hard he played, I called him a sociopath that
*  won't play during the season cause he's just going all out and he's out there up
*  20 and fourth quarters and he's flying around like it's game seven and you know,
*  the more, the more of those kinds of miles you put on during the six months
*  that don't matter, sometimes you can have bad luck.
*  Doc finishes my guy, Doc.
*  He finishes 19 and 23 on the bucks.
*  Um, if you told me before the year, here's what's going to happen with the bucks
*  this season, remember the bucks were like one of the three favorites in the league.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And if there was video of somebody saying like, here's what I think will happen.
*  Griffin gets fired halfway through the season, even though they have the third
*  best record in the, in the East doc takes over, it goes under 500 Yannis gets hurt
*  right before the playoffs doesn't play a playoff game and they lose to the
*  Pacers in round one, you'd been like, that's fucking crazy.
*  What do we want to bet?
*  101 odds, 201 odds, 300.
*  Well, it's the weirdest.
*  I think it's a weirder outcome than Phoenix.
*  I think it's a much weirder outcome than Lakers or warriors.
*  Cause you could have actually predicted that because those teams are on this is
*  how Milwaukee season played out is the weirdest outcome we had this year.
*  I think is there a weirder one for you?
*  No, they went down playing Danilo Gallinari who's like two years removed from being
*  two years removed from being an NBA player.
*  Yeah.
*  I like, but where was Blake Griffin was Blake Griffin's like, I'm right here guys.
*  How's that not involved?
*  Just the most doc shit you can imagine.
*  Like the number of players who get in these games over the bucks, young guys.
*  Yeah.
*  As you're mapping their future, I think there's lots of things you could do as
*  far as, you know, they, they're a roster that just needed one more off season
*  replenishment to get to a functional rotation to begin with.
*  They just had to carve out too much to make the Dane trade work, to make the
*  roster work, they lost some guys to other teams.
*  It just kind of got away from them coming into this season.
*  And I thought they might fix that along the way they didn't, but they need like
*  a Peyton Watson as much as anybody.
*  They need a young guy that doc will, and I understand the paradox of what
*  I'm about to suggest someone he can maybe possibly hypothetically trust and
*  at least work through some mistakes.
*  That's what he'd rather trust.
*  Pat Beverly.
*  It's like, I trust pepper who whipped a basketball at a fan tonight.
*  You're the end of the game.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, listen, I think they're in really bad shape and I feel the same way about
*  the Lakers and the Warriors from the sense of, we do this with the, with the
*  talk cycle and you know, this is the ESPN shows it's like, can the Lakers
*  turn around, what do the Lakers have to do?
*  You can't think of it that way.
*  You have to look at the best teams in the league, the youth of those teams and how
*  you measure your own team against the ceiling of the best teams and the best
*  teams are Boston and Denver and Minnesota and Oklahoma city.
*  Those are the teams that next year will be in just as good of a position
*  as they are this year.
*  And if you don't have a chance with the roster you have to swim in that
*  pool, what do you do if you're Milwaukee?
*  It's like, you, it's going to be a real stretch for you to go, go jump from
*  the kiddie pool to that pool.
*  What's your move?
*  And if you don't have a move, maybe you blow it up because you already won the
*  title, like maybe they have Yannis.
*  I understand the skepticism, but if you are the bucks, your, your hope is that.
*  It's Jason Tatum who pulls his calf and not Yannis, right?
*  Your hope is that it's not Dane with the sore Achilles, but drew holiday or
*  Al Horford, right?
*  Like you're looking across and saying, maybe the bad luck won't be ours next time.
*  And maybe our roster will be marginally enough better that we can get through
*  series.
*  You're older though.
*  You are.
*  James is a year older.
*  Lopez is a year older.
*  Middleton zero there.
*  And Yannis is and he's superhuman, but yeah.
*  Um, but that's, I don't really know what the fixes are for them.
*  They don't have any picks.
*  They're not going to have cap space.
*  No.
*  So now you're shopping in the J Crowder aisle again.
*  And it's like, Oh, here's Kyle Lowry wants to play for us.
*  Hey, good news.
*  Tobias Harris will take the mid level and that's who you're getting.
*  So I just don't see the fix for them.
*  I think it's pretty grim.
*  Um, this could have been Dame's chance to carry them for around, by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  But like, we don't have Yannis get on my back guys.
*  I'm Dame Lillard, one of the best 75 players ever.
*  And didn't do it.
*  I mean, 28 on a bad, on a sore Achilles,
*  Andrew and him hard at every opportunity.
*  Like just saying he didn't do it.
*  He didn't.
*  I'm a results guy, Rob.
*  I'm a results guy.
*  He didn't do it.
*  He had a chance of sitting there for him.
*  Yeah.
*  Speaking of chances, we have Orlando, Cleveland tomorrow night with Dallas Clippers.
*  Do you want to hear about my trip to Dallas Clippers?
*  Please.
*  Very excited.
*  Game five.
*  Game five's are always my favorite games of the series.
*  I always feel like they're super intense.
*  Uh, it was excited for the crowd Wednesday night, seven o'clock.
*  Uh, people were out having little early dinners popping in the people are drinking
*  real energy in the stands and unfortunately that energy didn't translate to the Clippers.
*  You guys talked about it on Ringer at BS show yesterday, but it was,
*  you could tell with Hardin right away.
*  He didn't want to, he didn't want to be there.
*  Um, Paul George, they did some stuff to mess with them, but it wasn't the
*  greatest game for him either.
*  Um, and Dallas who now I've seen a couple of times in person, that team's
*  really locked in with each other.
*  I really liked the chemistry they have.
*  Luca's a huge pain in the ass, right?
*  He just, he's talking to the refs after every play.
*  He just doesn't shut up.
*  He has to be for the refs, the single most important point in the week.
*  He's he doesn't score.
*  He's chirping.
*  There's a stoppage on fouls.
*  He's walking over and yelling at whoever like he's just like this.
*  But he's really intense.
*  And I gotta say it's transferred to Kyrie.
*  Like this version of Kyrie is the most fun Kyrie of all time.
*  Kyrie came out in that game and he's like, I'm stopping James
*  Harden tonight and really went at him.
*  I don't think they like each other.
*  And when Adam went at him and Adam, he didn't really have a good offensive game,
*  but his energy and his defense, uh, was, was really, really good.
*  The interesting thing about that game, Rob Dallas, I think was like three for
*  21 at one point from three and they were still up 12.
*  And I was with my friend Rob stone and we were getting toward the half.
*  And I was like, they're going to win by 30 because if any of their shots
*  had got this game's already over, they just had, didn't hit all their wide open.
*  I don't know what this means for game six, but my feeling is Dallas is better.
*  And the only way the Clippers are going to be able to stave this off is just
*  another crazy Harden game with a crazy George game.
*  I don't see another path for them, especially with the way Westbrook is playing.
*  Um, I don't, I don't really see anybody at like, they might get, maybe they get
*  a crazy Norman Powell game.
*  I don't know.
*  It's possible.
*  But I think Dallas has figured them out and I think they're better.
*  And I think they're going to win game six.
*  What'd you take?
*  Even the Clippers best stretches.
*  There's been some incandescent three-point shooting.
*  It's just, it's a variance kind of series from the other side of it.
*  When, when the Clippers hit a ton of threes, they're in it.
*  Otherwise they really have to scrap and claw because the Mavericks will challenge
*  guys like Russ in particular, and obviously if Zeus out there, there's multiple
*  non-shooters at the same time.
*  There's so much room for Dallas to sag in and clog the paint.
*  And most importantly, I just think swarm Paul George and Harden when they get
*  inside, like that, that defense is starting to feel pretty ferocious in terms of,
*  you know, Derek Jones on the point of attack with Paul George in particular, but
*  you've got PJ Washington swiping it.
*  You've got Gafford and Lively, Lively, I mean, for, for a rookie, you know,
*  for a rookie having this kind of room protection, like impact on a series
*  is an incredible feat.
*  I just think they have it together defensively and have more, they've
*  like more levers to pull.
*  They have more options in terms of what they can do to adapt to a series than
*  this version of the Clippers does.
*  They get some good rim runner stuff.
*  They can score points even if they're not hitting threes, which I like.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, which that's new, like during the regular season before the trade, they
*  lost almost every game in which they did not hit a higher percentage of the
*  threes than their opponents did.
*  They, that's who they were for the first chunk of the season.
*  Then Kyrie got healthy.
*  They made those trades to improve the rotation.
*  Other guys kind of got back into the lineup too, in all fairness.
*  I mean, they've had injuries all year.
*  And then after the deadline, they found this incredible rhythm and it was
*  defensively, of course, like that's where the greatest improvement was by the
*  numbers, but also their offensive stability just feels so much more reliable.
*  I'm not apologizing for anything I ever said about Kyrie.
*  I really like watching Kyrie and I'm, I'm glad he's reached whatever point in life
*  that is in because he is so much fucking fun to watch in person, play basketball.
*  There's nobody like that, dude.
*  When he gets the ball, he's the only guy in the league.
*  If he gets the ball, like on a fast break transition, but there's two guys back
*  or three, you can see him size it up and it'd be like, I'm scoring anyway.
*  He just goes in and does like his weird Kyrie fucking magician shit.
*  He's and he really plays.
*  I really think he has something special with Luca.
*  Like I would not want to see those guys.
*  If I'm okay.
*  See if I'm okay.
*  See I'm rooting for the Quippers because you don't beat the Quippers though.
*  They'll outwork them though.
*  They're just, you know, the Quippers will have these ebbs and flows.
*  Okay.
*  See is the same every game.
*  Basically they'll have like the one game in this series where they don't miss
*  threes, but I guarantee they're rooting for the Quippers to come back.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And I don't think they're going to come back.
*  I don't think so either.
*  Ultimately, they're going to come back.
*  I don't think so either.
*  Ultimately, the Clippers are more predictable and that's a weird thing to say when
*  obviously the Mavs funnel so much offense through Luca and through Kyrie kind of
*  secondarily, but you know, zoomed out.
*  That's predictable.
*  Luca is going to have the ball, but you zoom all the way in.
*  Luca has the ball.
*  What move is he going to make?
*  What step is he going to sell you with?
*  What fake is he going to throw off your entire defense?
*  And Kyrie has the same thing.
*  He's so shifty.
*  He's so clever, so creative.
*  That's how he gets through all those crowds and finishes the way that he does
*  to the point where you're right.
*  He didn't have an explosive like game offensively, but the shots he hit were
*  shots that no one else on the team can make.
*  And that kind of opportunism is so important for, for kind of their
*  general ecosystem really.
*  And there's a swagger with them.
*  One of those guys is always out there.
*  Yeah.
*  So it feels like their offense never dips.
*  I thought they're going to win last night.
*  That was my big fan dual boost.
*  I've hit nine fandel boosts in a row.
*  Oh, include the next one today.
*  Um, I really thought Dallas was going to win.
*  I really thought they were better.
*  And I didn't think the Paul George heart and two games in a row thing could happen.
*  That said, you can't roll out the Quippers just cause they're too unpredictable.
*  I think Dallas is going to win and I think they're better, but could
*  the Quippers hit 25 threes.
*  God only knows, um, once a week, James Harden lived up to his name yesterday.
*  You could see it immediately.
*  And the other thing that was weird, Westbrook has just lost his, not only
*  his mojo, but almost it seems like his mind in this last three games, he's
*  hitting the point, Rob, which is the worst point you can hit as a basketball
*  player when he has the ball and he's wide open in a home game and the crowd goes,
*  Oh, don't, you hear like the no murmurs.
*  They don't want him to do anything.
*  And it's like, man, he's, I actually think he's unplayable now.
*  And if I were them, I would do more Zubats.
*  I would try to pound that pound the Mavericks inside with Zubats, try to
*  get the big guys in foul trouble.
*  And I would never double Luca ever.
*  It would be my other advice.
*  I mean, you double Luke.
*  It's like, you just, you can't just let him get 40.
*  It's easier said than done.
*  I feel like, but you know, it's a similar philosophy to what the Knicks just
*  had to navigate with Joel.
*  And it's like an injured player.
*  And it's a question of how much you want to force them in Lucas' case to
*  exert that knee where he's already feeling some stress with it.
*  He's already pretty sensitive with it.
*  Having an incredible series regardless of that, but do you want to just see
*  him push it and push it and push it just to see what happens and not let all
*  these other guys get off the trade off is it's so easy to talk yourself into
*  the idea of we're going to live and die with Derek Jones, Jr.
*  Threes and Maxie Cleaver.
*  Like that's an understandable defensive game plan, but then Maxie Cleaver is
*  our greatest living shooter now.
*  So maybe you need to adjust it.
*  I got to say, I think Luca seems fine.
*  But I know they're like, yeah, his knees banged up.
*  It's like he was put, you talked about it on the show today.
*  He was pushing the ball with real pace and they, they'd really tried
*  to, I think push the pace partly because to harden and partly just to change it up.
*  But, uh, it worked.
*  The other one we have tomorrow is Orlando Cleveland game six.
*  I call Cleveland three faces of Cleveland.
*  They just, there's three different faces.
*  I don't know what face they're going to wear.
*  What are the three faces?
*  Well, there's the face where Jared Allen doesn't play and Moby goes to center.
*  And I'm like, my stock's just skyrocketing.
*  Cause that was pretty good.
*  Evan Moby should play and all of a sudden they look great.
*  Um, there's the no Garland just hits mobile.
*  It's a Mitchell's team calves where it's like, Oh, this is kind of like the Utah
*  situation for him and this looks like something.
*  And then there's the other version where everybody's playing and
*  nobody seems that happy.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that's where we're going to tomorrow night of Jared Allen plays.
*  I think Orlando is going to win tomorrow night.
*  I think Orlando is a really good home team.
*  And this feels like, this feels like one of these two has to go seven because of
*  the rule, we have to have a seven game series and run one.
*  This would be my pick.
*  What about you?
*  I would love it.
*  And it does feel like temperamentally the kind of series where just home teams win
*  every time, right?
*  Like that's just kind of how the balance of the series has swung for the most part.
*  I agree with you that the, uh, the face with Evan Moby at the five is, is the
*  most handsome of the Cavaliers faces.
*  That's, that's the one I would love to see personally.
*  It's the one that.
*  Look, I'm so invested.
*  I'm so leveraged in Evan Moby stock at this point that after he had an
*  incredible game saving close, I couldn't even gloat about it.
*  I just had to wait for people to come crawling back to me and gloat in response.
*  Like that's, that's where I'm at with this experiment.
*  So anything we can do for me personally, uh, to let Evan Moby shine, I'm in favor
*  of, and honestly, it seems like in a lot of cases and specifically in this matchup,
*  they are better suited playing with a little more space, with a little more
*  maneuverability and from the sounds of some of the interview quotes that are
*  coming out of the Cavaliers, I think Donovan Mitchell agrees with us.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, so if he stays, I, by the way, Jared Allen will have real trade value.
*  If that's something to go, really good player and a good contract.
*  Yes.
*  And there's teams that need size.
*  So maybe that's how this heads.
*  I think Moby is a five.
*  That's how I've justified my, um, untenable stock position in him.
*  It's like, I just, when he's at the five, this is all going to pay off.
*  Um, Orlando has at home, they get stuff from their bench.
*  They get scoring.
*  They don't normally get, it's not all on Palo's shoulders, but Palo has been,
*  I mean, he was so good in game five and I feel like he's one of the young guys
*  that it's him and aunt are just kind of Maxie in game five.
*  Maybe not tonight, but, uh, my hope would be not to put too many miles on Palo
*  and game six, try to get the group effort.
*  And then he's the one that's going to have to win game seven.
*  It's going to have to be a 40 point, you know, 12 rebound, nine assist type.
*  Awesome game.
*  I think for them to win in Cleveland, cause I don't trust any other score they have.
*  I'm not just France, you know, on the road in a game seven, I mean, he's not
*  shooting, he's not, he's, he's going to the basket.
*  Yes, that is true.
*  But that's kind of where I prefer him is going to the basket for the most part.
*  I do think both of those guys have gotten better over the course of the series at
*  toning down some of the more flustered decision-making, like, you know, possessions
*  that are going nowhere without the space.
*  Like Palo is learning how to navigate it and very common learning curve for, for
*  young stars in his position, everything as far as his path through this series
*  has felt about right, you know, some early struggles, run, trying to run through the
*  wall.
*  And over the course of it, you can see the gears turning and you can see him trying
*  to solve everything that's in front of him, whether it's a big lineup or a small
*  one, he had a lot of tools at his disposal.
*  And I think what's most exciting about the magic is he can do all this right now.
*  And he's going to be able to do more when he's playing with, I would say in
*  particular, some guards who make his life easier.
*  And right now I love Jalen Suggs.
*  It's not really what he does out there.
*  He does a lot of other things, especially defensively, but they need some
*  facilitation at some point and they may be able to get through the series without
*  it, but that's kind of next on the agenda.
*  Well, as Mike Lombardi would say, sometimes you're one injury away and Gary Harris
*  got hurt.
*  And that might've been one of the best things that happened in the magic because
*  it opened the open some minutes for, for some other people.
*  I was thinking, I don't know why, but I feel like Orlando is going to win this
*  series.
*  And I, I don't, it's not rational.
*  Yeah.
*  I just, I think they're going to win game six.
*  And I don't believe in that.
*  I could see that Cleveland team either winning by 20 or losing by two at home.
*  Uh, but I was thinking if it, if it does end up being Orlando, Boston, and we're
*  on two, that's another stomach punch for the Philly fans faults first.
*  Tate them.
*  They're like, really?
*  Now, now we got to watch this.
*  What if faults becomes one of the heroes in the last two games on top of everything?
*  That'd be sensational.
*  I would look, I would love to see it.
*  Um, Minnesota, Denver, do you have a pick?
*  Denver, I would say Denver six.
*  I think Denver, I I'm actually probably not betting the series.
*  You're scared.
*  All.
*  I want to watch a game.
*  If you were going to create a team in a lab to beat Denver, a realistic team, I
*  think it would be Minnesota the way Edwards is playing.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause you think like size to throw Yocage, size to throw Murray.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the big one.
*  Size and link.
*  And it's just, it's, but it's, it's comes down to the late game stuff with them.
*  And how ready is Edwards do it?
*  It's one of those things where it's like, you know what?
*  Minnesota is going to win.
*  I bet on Minnesota.
*  And then you're in these last two minutes of games and there's Yocage on one end,
*  just doing fucking Yocage stuff.
*  And then the other end, I have 22 year old Anthony Edwards and it's like, all
*  right, we're not playing Phoenix anymore.
*  We're playing the defending champs.
*  And he got a little, what was I thinking?
*  He's, he's great.
*  He's not ready for this, but then there's the flip side of this where
*  maybe he is ready for this.
*  He's passed every test so far.
*  Like the sons, every game I thought his decision making was pretty much.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's a chance these are the two best teams.
*  Yes.
*  Because if Boston's not going to have Porzingis here for three, four weeks,
*  I don't know, how would you rank Minnesota, Denver, Boston right now?
*  No, Porzingis.
*  Are we, are we just boxing?
*  Okay.
*  See, I have this conversation.
*  We don't have to.
*  Based on how they played in the playoffs, I think, see, this is the thing
*  like Denver is almost better on paper than they are as far as their actual
*  playoff performance right now.
*  They have not covered themselves in glory.
*  They had incredible clutch moments.
*  They had incredible stretches.
*  I still think they're the best team overall, but they haven't quite played like it.
*  I think, I think Minnesota has played as well as anybody in the postseason has.
*  So it just depends on how you want to play.
*  Or Minnesota got to play a team partly built around Bradley Beale and Yusuf Nurgic.
*  Also true.
*  Also true.
*  It's a certain kind of advantage for sure, but to be honest,
*  Minnesota is going to have a bench advantage against a lot of these teams,
*  Denver included, right?
*  They, they just have more that they can plug into the lineup and it's going to
*  be a real test of how much Murray can stretch and how much Yokoch is stamina,
*  which is very impressive, can stretch in some of these games.
*  Like they're going to have to play huge minutes because you can just imagine,
*  you know, Reggie Jackson being thrown into the fire and what that looks
*  like in some of these games.
*  Right.
*  The Chris Finch torn patella thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that do anything for you for this series?
*  It does a little hard.
*  That's going to be the coach with a fucking torn patella.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, we'll look, we've seen coaches struggle to get timeouts fully mobile
*  and imagine if he's either like in some kind of protected throne situation or if
*  he's out there on crutches, I don't know what he's going to be on the scooter.
*  Like when they have a rascal with it, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He think, oh, let's kick Chris Fincher rascal.
*  What is he doing?
*  Wheelchair?
*  Like what, what, what?
*  There was this rumor going around that he was actually going to be in a luxury box
*  texting instructions that I don't believe.
*  But I, it's just not ideal.
*  Like you watch these coaches and they're going up and down the sidelines
*  or yelling at refs.
*  Like it does feel like a slight disadvantage.
*  Well, especially the kind of team we're talking about, which is one in which
*  Anthony Edwards has been so impressive, but we are going to wring our hands a
*  little bit in those clutch moments, as far as what kind of decisions he's going
*  to be making on the floor and what kind of chances he's going to be taking.
*  And Chris Finch is kind of a counterbalance to that in some sense.
*  He lets ant play, but he also kind of settles him down sometimes.
*  Well, the other thing with the ant, and this is the greatest thing about him.
*  He really thinks he's the best part in the league and he wants it so badly.
*  This could be a, he wants it too bad.
*  Oh yeah.
*  He wants it.
*  He wanted a too badly series and then he'll learn everything for next year.
*  Or like you watch Conley.
*  I watched that, uh, he was on the Barkley show yesterday.
*  Yeah.
*  For a teammate of the year.
*  Team at the air.
*  I know I heard the start of your show and who, who did very give
*  the teammate of the year?
*  He gave it to was over me.
*  Yeah.
*  He gave it to us.
*  I thought that was, I didn't even get a vote.
*  Yeah, that was ridiculous.
*  Um, but Conley has that thing they ask about Edwards and he's just like, yo,
*  man, he's, he's like a young Michael Jordan and just like, goes on this.
*  He's like, you don't understand how good this guy is.
*  He was doing those quotes.
*  And as you know, I love quote, I love teammate on teammate quotes.
*  It's kind of my jam.
*  How did you feel about the ants checking cat at the podium?
*  Quote, by the way, the like, I fucking loved it.
*  You gotta stop fucking fouling situation.
*  I loved it.
*  I love all this stuff.
*  And I just think, I think the team genuinely believes this guy is as
*  great as everyone else in the league.
*  And that's the feeling I get with Dallas too.
*  Like they really believe in Luca.
*  They think he's the best part in the league.
*  Denver knows Yoko is the best part in the league.
*  It's part of my fear with, with Boston is like, nobody, nobody in Boston's like
*  Tatum's the best player in the league.
*  They're like, we have the best team in the league.
*  Like it's not a specific player.
*  All right.
*  So you have, you have Denver one.
*  Minnesota too.
*  You have, okay.
*  See above or below?
*  No, poor Zingas Boston.
*  I I'll put them below out of respect for Boston's level of execution still.
*  And the fact that at some point, okay.
*  See, it's going to run into either the size disadvantage.
*  It's going to hurt them or the inexperienced disadvantage.
*  It's going to hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  So I do think they're at least worth noting though.
*  I think it's, it's much closer than a top three and then okay.
*  See, he's off to the side.
*  I think they're very much in that mix.
*  Okay.
*  See Dallas, which feels like that can happen and probably will happen.
*  Is going to be an awesome series.
*  Like awesome.
*  I can't wait.
*  It could be.
*  We might have to have the party and send out the invite for the
*  Jayden Williams breakout party.
*  Oh yeah.
*  If they beat them, it's going to be because of what he does on both ends and how he
*  defends him and Lou Doherty on Luca and just them tag teaming him and trying to
*  make him a little bit more though.
*  But I, I like that matchup for them.
*  I actually think I would pick them in that series.
*  I think so too.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the kind of where obviously Dallas has a lot of momentum with the way
*  they finish the regular season.
*  And some of these like games are very inspiring in terms of their first
*  round series.
*  I don't really understand the okay.
*  See like skepticism in general.
*  That's a good ass team that really just laid laid the smack down on the Pelicans
*  in a lot of ways, tactically speaking, like left New Orleans without anything to do.
*  And that's because of how versatile the thunder can be.
*  It's a great point because the first game they seemed really close even without Zion.
*  It was a nice up and down battle.
*  And by game three, okay.
*  I want to see them do it against a team with a really good player.
*  The fact that they got to play New Orleans without Zion.
*  I probably underestimated it because I thought New Orleans was a possible upset
*  pick, but there's something too though about the, you know, you brought up like the
*  best player in the league kind of conversation, whether it's guys like ant who believe
*  that about themselves or Luca, who, you know, the teammates and he believes that
*  about himself, it's kind of similar to something we were talking about on group
*  chat with the, the, with the, with the, the, with the, with the, with the, with the,
*  with the, with the, with the, with the, with the, with the, with the, with the,
*  chat, which is the face of the lead conversation.
*  Yeah.
*  To me, if you have to ask, you're probably not it.
*  And like Tatum is kind of in that group.
*  Like you're, you're just not it.
*  And I think he's not impressive about guys like Luca guys like Shay.
*  And just a great example.
*  When it was kind of first emerging, you could sense a bit of tension between him
*  and towns as to what the identity and what the pecking order of the team was going
*  to be, I don't really sense any of that anymore.
*  And that's because you don't really have to ask with hands.
*  Like it is, it's abundantly clear that he is that guy and Luca is that guy.
*  And Shay is that guy.
*  And Tatum is a great leader and the best player on a great team, but he's not that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they lucked out because this poor Zynga's injury happens during a year where
*  the Eastern conference is just completely decimated.
*  You would have thought they were a LeBron calves been 2010 steam with all the injury.
*  Look, they got, um, it's sitting there for ant.
*  And as we head into the weekend, you beat Denver.
*  That's the official rival.
*  For sure.
*  They probably make the finals that they beat Denver puts them in the finals.
*  There's face to the league potential.
*  And then we're going to team USA in Paris in July.
*  And there's, there's a scenario here where he just starts checking off boxes and all
*  of a sudden is the biggest star in the league.
*  And I don't think anyone else in the playoffs can say that.
*  It, I mean, SGA, if he runs the slate and wins the title, it's a, maybe a conversation,
*  but he doesn't have the charisma that he has.
*  I mean, nobody has the charisma.
*  It has, it would be more of a collective thing.
*  Like, Oh my God, the thunder here even sooner than we thought.
*  And of course, Shay would be a part of that, but I think it would be like the,
*  the credit and the praise would be a little bit more diverse.
*  Presti would be like, they've won the title and he is 29 first.
*  He'd be like the guy in monopoly.
*  He was just paying people to roll the dice for him.
*  He's like, Hey, if you make my pick, I'll give you a second rounder in 2029.
*  And if you go get me a diet Coke, he's just taunting everybody.
*  Uh, so we both have, we both have Denver.
*  Yes.
*  Minus two Oh five.
*  I'm Fandora.
*  I'm going to try to figure out some sort of a serious boost.
*  It does feel like if I had gone to my head, I would do Denver.
*  Okay.
*  See, but I want to see if Dallas closes out the Clippers in a certain way.
*  It might make me rethink the okay.
*  See thing.
*  I want to see Dallas come out and basically chop their heads off.
*  Like nothing left.
*  There's no chance you guys are coming back.
*  We are ruining you guys.
*  We're going to make Paul George want to get the fuck out of here and go to the
*  Easter conference and do one of those things.
*  All right.
*  Rob Mahoney.
