# Jokic Is Unstoppable in Potential Nuggets-Celtics Finals Preview | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5RAiSMI9gU)
*  Rob, I'm going to start here. The Celtics lost to the Nuggets. So Sunday Celtics killed
*  the Warriors. They're 48 and 12. Everybody's like, Whoa, Oh my God, juggernaut. And they're
*  up 20 against 22 against the Cavs. They blow that down the stretch. Then Jokic makes them
*  look like a pretender tonight. I like it. All the pressure off the Celtics. No expectations.
*  We're back. Good try. Good. I mean, it's admirable what you're trying to do, but, uh, yeah, I
*  don't think we're quite there yet.
*  Jokic is the best player in the world and one of the best offensive players of my lifetime.
*  And he's getting to the point down the stretch of these games. You cannot out execute him.
*  You can really only do what Phoenix did on Sunday night is just outscore him. Yeah, because
*  he's just getting baskets. He's either going to score. If you're just going to single cover
*  him, he's going to score on that guy. If you're going to sad guys on him, he's going to find
*  somebody. Gordon's always lurking over the baseline. It's always something. And it feels like
*  he's 80% down the stretch of these games. Rob. Yeah. Somehow the most under covered part
*  of Nikola Jokic is that he's sneakily maybe the best crunch time player in the league.
*  And he is completely unflappable, stays completely within himself and gets whatever shot he
*  wants. And usually in the case of games like this against the Celtics, that's right, right
*  at the basket. And even when it looks like the shot he wants, sometimes it's actually a lobbed
*  out. And that's a great way to play a game like this.
*  And then last but not least, we have a question for Aaron Gordon for one of the most impressive
*  plays in crunch time. You'll see all season. Nuggets didn't even, other than him, didn't even
*  really play that well, except for Peyton Watson. Half of the crowd was rooting for the Celtics.
*  What a Peyton Watson game though.
*  Incredible. Holy shit.
*  When I saw them the other night, I hadn't really seen him in person playing, playing real minutes
*  and his, his athleticism just kind of jumps out of the building when you're there.
*  Yeah. And then today it was the same thing.
*  Like, you know, Mike Malone, they lose Bruce Brown and they're really like Brown, who did
*  some good stuff for them last year, but they're counting on him more.
*  And then Watson, they're like, look, these have to be our guys.
*  We're going to ride this out. We're going to have some ups, we're going to have some downs.
*  And we hope by March, by April, we can count on these guys to me.
*  Watson is and I can count on this guy now.
*  He's really starting to feel himself athletically on the flip side, the Celtics bench, Tillman,
*  Horford, minus 12, minus 10.
*  Hauser was fine.
*  He was just had happened to be out there at the wrong time.
*  And Pritchard once again, looked super small and the Celtics bench just couldn't really
*  hold anything. And then there's the Tatum thing.
*  Do you want to do that now?
*  Yeah. Where do you want to start with him?
*  It was a rough week for Tatum because we had that crunch time last play of the game,
*  Cleveland, 19 dribbles, walked it up, started too late.
*  It seemed like he got fouled, but then he didn't.
*  They lose. And the next day it's just his clutch numbers become the story.
*  And everybody kind of at the same time looks it up and goes, oh, wow, he's actually one of the
*  worst clutch players in the league out of all the stars that we have.
*  He's 35 percent field goal and it kind of backed up what the eye test was showing.
*  So he did take a beating there for, you know, on the in the basketball online community.
*  He did take a little bit of a beating for the first time in a while.
*  This is somebody that a week ago, people were like, why can't he be the MVP?
*  And I was on this podcast going, look, I love the Celtics.
*  There's no way he's the MVP.
*  You know, which is in the league and he's healthy and he's kicking ass.
*  But you can think of five or six reasons he wouldn't be the MVP personally.
*  Right. Well, here tonight's a good example.
*  Like he just can kind of disappear every once in a while.
*  The game tonight is five field goals and five turnovers.
*  And he missed the biggest shot of the game when they're coming back.
*  Cut it to two.
*  That one around does this like big boy outdoor playground steel on Jamal Murray,
*  where he's just like annihilating him, picks his pocket.
*  They have a three on one and somehow it ends up with a wide open
*  Tatum three in front of the bench.
*  Forty seconds left. Misses it.
*  And then I'll take the lead. That was the game, especially a game where you get
*  a huge place from Brown, from KP, from Drew Holiday.
*  And then when it comes to be Tatum's turn and this was, you know,
*  this is the virtue of the team, the Celtics have built is that he doesn't have to do
*  everything, but he does have to deliver in those sorts of moments.
*  And it's unfortunate the way the magnifying glass kind of comes down on you here.
*  The microscope, I should say, like the level of scrutiny,
*  star players in under crunch time is never exactly fair.
*  But this is the burden that you take on as the best player on a great team.
*  And it's the burden is going to be held to all postseason long,
*  whether he delivers or not.
*  And I think the reality of this Boston team is they're going to win some close,
*  really competitive games down the stretch of playoff series.
*  But for the most part, I think they're going to have to win, if not going away,
*  then by keeping teams at a bit of a distance.
*  I think what they want to avoid is less this kind of crunch time situation
*  and more the Cleveland one.
*  Don't let teams cut into leads that they have no business cutting into
*  and avoid those situations.
*  And you're probably good enough and talented enough to just be fine.
*  It would be nice if Joe Masula
*  had a sense of the pace of the game to like even today.
*  Nuggets are in control. We go to halftime.
*  I think they're up eight Celtics come out to straight basket.
*  Mike Malone's like, I've seen enough time out calls time out was like 50 seconds in.
*  That was what was missing in that Cavs game where you could feel something,
*  something flipping in the game.
*  The Cavs started hitting threes, the Seltzer up 22.
*  It's like just cut a time out now and we're up 17.
*  Let's hey, hey, guys. Hey, hey, let's stay focused here.
*  I thought Mike Malone today was great.
*  Like some of the stuff they were doing to mess with Tatum,
*  they were throwing length at them.
*  They were throwing like kind of pseudo doubles at them.
*  Caldwell Pope was jumping into passing lanes.
*  And yes, I thought that was Caldwell Pope.
*  What did he end up with?
*  Yeah. Eleven points. Like, oh, whatever.
*  Caldwell Pope was disruptive defensively.
*  And so was Gordon.
*  And I thought the length of those guys, plus Watson, really gave Tatum problems in this game.
*  Yeah. That second level from KCP, where when you're showing on the pick and roll,
*  you're putting your defense in a vulnerable position.
*  Somebody from the back line has to be doing something aggressive
*  or else the team like Boston is just going to beat you.
*  Right. Like KP is going to roll to the elbow, get a really clean shot over the top of somebody.
*  Some a cutter is going to get a look going to the rim or Tatum's just going to go around
*  Nicole Jokic and get a pretty good look.
*  But when you have KCP scrambling through and mucking everything up,
*  coming away with three steals in this game and they were basically like pick six type steals,
*  like the stairs going the other way.
*  Huge momentum plays.
*  Yeah. That's the kind of veteran thing that you're not getting from any work a day three and D player.
*  It's what separates guys like KCP from, you know, the genre that they're in.
*  There's seven deep.
*  Seven and a half with Reggie Jackson.
*  Sure. Right. The Nuggets.
*  But the seven and a half really play well.
*  And it's hard to notice when guys are in and out, unless Jokic isn't out there.
*  There's a real cohesion with them.
*  The Celtics.
*  I was I was psyched.
*  Poor Zingas played in this game.
*  I really wanted to see like their top six against against Jokic.
*  But Corford was kind of the odd man out and it was really Joe Mas riding those five guys.
*  And I wonder like if this this ends up being the finals, which
*  I think from the level of play tonight, that felt like the finals.
*  Right.
*  Both teams were treating it like it.
*  Like you could even tell if you just want to rewind, watch Denver's defenders closing out to the Celtic shooters.
*  And you tell me this wasn't a team taking this game very seriously.
*  And and the stuff Jalen Brown was doing.
*  I mean, that was one of the best games Jalen's played in his entire career.
*  I know he missed a bunch of free throws, but there was a couple of moments in this game when it seemed like Denver is just going to go up like 20.
*  And he just kept he just kept pulling them back into it.
*  Poor Zingas had some some good plays, too.
*  But the reason about a poor for it is the Celts are basically five guys in this game.
*  And I don't when poor Zingas is really playing, they lean on him like they did today.
*  But 35 minutes today.
*  Then that becomes a weird spot for Horford, who I think they need and against a team like Denver, especially.
*  I wonder, like, if they end up meeting in the finals, would they stagger the minutes a little bit?
*  Try to try to have him out there a little bit more against Jokic or what they'll do.
*  Tillman to me, did Tillman look, see, look 100 percent to you watching him run around?
*  Looks OK. He looks a little gimpy to me.
*  I know he's had some some nice stuff.
*  He has that kind of movement, though, to be honest with you.
*  I say this is all to respect Xavier Tillman, but he's kind of a clunkier mover.
*  The one thing like even just looking at the box score, but also what the eye test said,
*  I didn't feel like White was involved enough in this game.
*  Yeah. Because I think that's if you look at the guys who have really given Denver trouble,
*  it's been a lot of like those guards that can just kind of slash and kick and get in the paint
*  and do stuff and kind of torch them.
*  And in this case, White in his eight shots, seven points.
*  But I don't know if it was a case of it was very brown, poor Zingas heavy.
*  But you think like the Celtics score 109 points.
*  They were 29 percent from three.
*  And you could come away from this game and say, hey, man, if we just shot the ball a little better,
*  Tatum makes that three with 40 seconds like our defense was pretty good.
*  Jokic is going to you know, he's a 30, 11 or 11 guy in any big game.
*  Like, we're fine if we see these guys again, we're here.
*  But on the other hand, Denver beat them twice and that's it.
*  And they've only played twice this year.
*  It could be one of those matchups like the Lakers in the Nuggets, where the games are close
*  and competitive and yet one of the teams just seems to be like a cut above an execution
*  level in the trust of their their core guys.
*  And even as you're saying, and like the flow and their ability to balance and get everyone
*  involved, I think ideally you want to get Derek White a little more involved in what you're
*  doing, a little more central to what you're doing.
*  But if Jalen Brown scoring this well and scoring this well out of isolation, right, he was
*  killing it. Unimpeachable creative game from Jalen Brown.
*  I have no issues with it whatsoever.
*  But there's going to be tradeoffs to that.
*  And some of the tradeoffs for Boston often, whether it's Brown or Tatum, usually who are
*  in that role, who are really going off one on one, you lose some of the movement, you
*  lose some of the momentum, you disconnect some of the pieces from your offense.
*  And so then when you look at, oh, why did we miss so many three pointers?
*  Sometimes it's a matter of guys not being as involved in the offense as they're used
*  to. And Boston does have that dynamic where they shift from guys going off for huge
*  individual scoring nights.
*  And also they're trying to work in this beautiful, elegant, balanced team game.
*  And those are those are hard things to bring about and have coexist at the same time.
*  And pace, which they only had 81 shots today, which I think they usually want to be
*  somewhere in the nineties. I'll say this about Jalen, who, you know, he signed that big
*  contract. I think even the first month of the season, I remember we did a segment on
*  the pod about it. It's like, what's how's this going to play out?
*  Is he going to feel like he has to justify this contract?
*  Is there going to be a little weird Tatum Brown thing?
*  Is the contract going to get in his head the first time he sucks for a week?
*  People are going to bring it up. How's this going to play out?
*  I think it's played out unbelievably well.
*  And something has shifted in his personality.
*  I'm going to say it happened mid-December, but even the little stuff like him wanting
*  to go to All-Star weekend, right?
*  Him, him wanting to be in the slam dunk contest.
*  Yeah.
*  Him wanting to win the All-Star MVP and Tatum telling Doc Rivers, like, give him my
*  minutes. Him, there's just like him against Golden State, like taking offense that
*  Draymond left him and like actually talking some shit.
*  Like there has been a little, little alpha thing kind of developing with him, which
*  has been interesting. And he has always had the sense.
*  One of the reasons I love the Tatum Brown combo and I've never given up on it.
*  They've had a sense of when to pick each other up when one of them is kind of
*  sucking. The other one's like, oh, I got to step it up because they're kind of a
*  tune to each other. Today was a good example.
*  Tatum didn't have it. You could see it, you know, for the first couple of minutes.
*  And Brown's like, all right, I got this.
*  And, and, you know, sometimes when he says I got this, it's a little scary.
*  Do you feel like he's going up a level because the stats, you know, he, he, he
*  averaged more points to game last year.
*  There's less shots this year from a per 36 standpoint.
*  It's pretty close from a percentages, fairly close.
*  But I think the difference with him is he's had some big games against good
*  teams, which last year and the last couple of years before, like the good teams,
*  the smart team really struggle.
*  And I don't feel like that's happening as much this year.
*  I don't feel like that's happening.
*  I don't know if he's gone up a level so much as I feel like he's more finely
*  tuned on when to attack and how to attack.
*  And maybe that's a definition of going up a level in a sense, but he, he seems to
*  fit better within the complexion of what the Celtics have.
*  And by that, I mean, some games he's gunning for it in the first quarter, knowing
*  that the offense is going to go elsewhere later, or some games he's gunning it in
*  transition and getting a lot of easy buckets at the rim for a team that
*  desperately needs them or cranking up defensively.
*  Like we saw him do it stretches of this game.
*  So I like that he has all those things in his arsenal.
*  I like that he is that kind of balanced player and that, yeah, there is a teetering
*  on the rails effect when he decides it's Jalen Brown time.
*  I think that's, I think that's,
*  I kind of like it.
*  I've given into it.
*  Absolutely.
*  If, look, if you're going to be a ballsy score, if you're going to be a secondary
*  guy who can stretch and explode and go off for 42 points in a game against the
*  defending champs, you're always going to be teetering on the edge of something.
*  Like you can't expect that player to be perfectly well-mannered all the time.
*  And to the extent you could, I think Jalen's did a really good job of that
*  this season.
*  Can I read you some texts from my dad starting about halfway through the game?
*  Are you going to do it in your dad's voice or in your voice?
*  No, I'll just read them.
*  8 38 PM.
*  So this is started the second F another no show by Tatum.
*  I respond.
*  Jalen has been great.
*  Too bad he can't make free throws.
*  My dad's response a little bit later, really tired of these no show games by
*  Tatum because of the lead teams.
*  Uh, so I texted him back.
*  Joe Mas putting Alan Tolman out there together with no yoga.
*  Just, just brutal.
*  That was tough.
*  He texted back Joe Mas getting exposed by all the top coaches.
*  He belongs to the second row.
*  All right.
*  And then just a little bit later, this is the Tatum from the golden state
*  series, afraid to be aggressive.
*  And then his final thoughts were again, Tatum sucked the whole game.
*  Really disappointing.
*  No show.
*  It's my dad.
*  I mean, he's 76 years old and it's like past midnight.
*  He's coastline, but very grumpy.
*  He, he has like a real fear about Tatum and some of these big games.
*  Like he just feels like there, there's some hurdle that he hasn't hurdled yet
*  where the game hasn't calmed down for him.
*  He's like, okay, this is what I do.
*  I'm just going to do this tonight.
*  Like the way Yokoj did.
*  Yokoj is like, all right, they're doing this.
*  I'll do this.
*  And Tatum, every time I feel like he's gotten there, a game like, like tonight
*  happens, he's so confounding in that way.
*  Like when he's good, he's not good because he makes the game look super easy.
*  It's just that he hits really hard shots.
*  Right.
*  And he manufactures really hard shots and he hits them at a high rate.
*  Like those are the good scoring Jason Tatum games.
*  He has lots of great other kinds of games, playmaking games, defensive
*  games, games where he's like operational and focal to what they're running.
*  All those things.
*  But Yokoj is a great counterpoint because he does make everything look so easy.
*  He does make splitting two defenders, spinning into a third and still making
*  the perfect read look like everyone should be able to do it.
*  And like that, the fact that Denver can always fall back on that if nothing else.
*  And that's just Yokoj.
*  Cause I think you could make the argument that Murray does some of those similar
*  things, although he has a similar Jalen Brown teetering on the edge of something
*  going on in his game too, that's exciting.
*  But when you have Yokoj, all of that makes sense.
*  A player like Aaron Gordon makes so much more sense.
*  A cutter who is as strong and as good a finisher and oh my God, the putback
*  dunk Aaron Gordon had, not to mention the lob might be the dunk of the year
*  on top of everything else.
*  So they just have everyone so perfectly placed around him.
*  And when your core guy can be trusted to make offense and then really make NBA
*  basketball look so easy, this is where you get, you beat historically great
*  regular season teams, you go on long playoff runs, you win finals, you win
*  finals, MVPs.
*  It's really looking like Denver's angling in that direction again.
*  Yeah.
*  I said on Sunday's pod, I was, I just feel like the road goes through them.
*  If they're going to be healthy, I don't see how a team beats them four times
*  in seven games.
*  I think they could beat them like Phoenix did on Sunday night where it's like, oh
*  yeah, we got their number and we beat them in OT, but to beat them four times
*  when they can execute at the level they can execute at is pretty nuts.
*  Is Jokic climbing the ladder for you?
*  That's a great question.
*  Cause I wouldn't say he's doing a lot this year that is over and beyond who
*  he's already been.
*  It's three straight years of it.
*  That's the thing.
*  Really like three and a half years of it.
*  The team around him is better, but he's, you know, that's, I think the thing
*  that's impressive to me is you're talking like an entire presidential term now of
*  him at this, of him at this level.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and you were so discouraging.
*  U S democracy could die before, you know, call it.
*  Okay.
*  It stops being a dominant NBA player.
*  It's so discouraging when you've bet against it or you're rooting against it.
*  Like today I'm like, and I think poor Zingas has been good.
*  I thought he was actually pretty good tonight.
*  That's about as much as you consider it.
*  They traded Marcus smart and got poor Zingas and two first round picks.
*  And then to see him today going kind of trying to go toe to toe with Jokic, but
*  Jokic just made him look silly.
*  And he, and poor Zingas is four inches taller than him.
*  He could just over and over again on one-on-one and get him and get the
*  shot he wanted and, and made poor Zingas smaller somehow.
*  That was the craziest thing to me.
*  He made poor Zingas seem like he was like six, eight.
*  I just, uh, he's really climbing up the ladder for me.
*  I, I, I, I'm hard pressed to think of a better offensive player I've ever seen.
*  Especially given, given everything that's going on in the NBA right now, like
*  there's an arms race across the sport where with crazy numbers and crazy
*  offensive efficiency, and there's the, like kind of teams have cracked the
*  code on spacing and how to use it.
*  And you're putting this guy who thinks the game at a level that's already in
*  the 99th or 100th percentile we've ever seen in that sort of climate.
*  It's, it's really a singular thing.
*  I mean, he had 11 assists tonight.
*  His assists are like, like super assists.
*  Cause it's like his assists are, I, Aaron Gordon had four alley hoops and Pope
*  had two wide open threes and like everything is like, he's basically
*  serving you the meal and giving you the fork and knife and putting the napkin
*  in your, in your neck and, and feeding you the assist.
*  It's pretty crazy.
*  I, I, to me it's Denver and Boston.
*  I thought from a strategy point, that was about as high level game I've seen.
*  We've seen a lot of entertaining games this year, but this one had some real
*  chess going on and, uh, and it felt like the finals.
*  So who, if you had to pick one of those two teams to not be in the finals,
*  which one are you taking?
*  Cause Denver has Denver's in a much harder conference.
*  That's the thing.
*  I think if I had to pick one of them, I would pick Denver just because there's,
*  there's more people that are going to be in the finals.
*  There's more people storming the gate in the West right now.
*  If, if we were feeling a little better about Milwaukee and I think, you know,
*  their defense is obviously much improved.
*  They're starting to show some things they haven't shown off season.
*  They're on the up and up, but Boston was so far ahead of them in terms of
*  postseason equity finals, contending equity that I think the Bucks still
*  have a lot to prove versus the nuggets we've seen can get caught against the
*  thunder or against the Clippers.
*  You know, like some of these teams, they're good matchups for Denver,
*  but I wouldn't put it entirely out of the realm of possibility, especially as
*  you mentioned, if Denver has an injury to a key guy, if Michael Porter Jr.
*  is out for a series, if Cantavious Colville Pope is out for a series,
*  it changes what they do a lot.
*  And it forces another young guy into an uncomfortable position.
*  They, they may not entirely be ready for, so I think Boston is more likely to
*  get to the finals, but if they both get there, I would pick the nuggets in a
*  heartbeat over the Celtics personally.
*  I think you have to out-offense Denver.
*  Is going.
*  So anybody that is not going to be able to outscore them four times,
*  you it's almost a cross-off.
*  So to me, it's like, it's Phoenix and the Clippers at this point.
*  And we found out actually during this game that towns is getting the surgery.
*  It's going to be four weeks brutal.
*  They're going to reevaluate.
*  We talk about Minnesota in the next segment because we taped it earlier, but, uh,
*  we're going to reevaluate after four weeks.
*  Those words have never been good.
