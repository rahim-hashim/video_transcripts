# Bill and Ryen’s NBA Defenders Draft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM)
*  We're doing a defense draft and we're stealing a page from, uh, Sean [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=0.0s)]
*  fantasy's big picture pod when he does the movie drafts, we have positions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=5.22s)]
*  We're still, and I are just going to draft the team. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=10.56s)]
*  You have to draft a center. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=12.84s)]
*  You have to draft two forwards. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=14.3s)]
*  You have to drop two guards. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=15.66s)]
*  You have to draft a six man and you have to draft a white guy and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=18.04s)]
*  you can draft them in any order. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=22.34s)]
*  So if you were the first pick in the draft, if you want to take the white [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=24.16s)]
*  guy and just get them off the board. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=27.5s)]
*  So, cause you, you feel like there's levels of white guys and you're like, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=29.02s)]
*  I want to get this white guy right now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  I don't want bill to get them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=34.54s)]
*  You can take that with your first pick. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=36.06s)]
*  So I'm going to give you the first pick cause cause cause you're the guest. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=39.14s)]
*  I appreciate that bill. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  Um, yeah, it's a really good point. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=44.86s)]
*  Cause I was prepping for my 18th annual fantasy draft where I do the solo [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  show and I just, I make the poor audience have to listen to that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=51.56s)]
*  monstrosity as I go 26 rounds deep or so I was doing a little prep and I went, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=55.62s)]
*  Ooh, might want to take a second baseman a little higher than he's going because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  I'm worried about the depth. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=64.14s)]
*  So in this case, it could be the white defender because I just don't know how [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=64.9s)]
*  much depth is there, but I think I'll get my guy if you don't take them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=67.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=72.7s)]
*  So I have the first pick. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  You, this is not me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=74.98s)]
*  Uh, I'm going to do this in honor of Saruti watching Jonathan Isaac, just [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=76.94s)]
*  wreck games, I'm going to take him as my sixth man. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=81.3s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=85.38s)]
*  Were you going to take him first? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  I was, I was going to take him first. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=93.14s)]
*  We both had the same, we both had the same first pick and it was a guy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=94.34s)]
*  who plays 15 minutes a game. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=99.14s)]
*  I said to, I said to Saruti on Thursday night that it was, it was what I imagine [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  of Bill Russell came from the 1960s in a time machine and just guarded Zion for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=107.82s)]
*  15 minutes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=113.66s)]
*  This is what Isaac looked like on Thursday night. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=115.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=118.02s)]
*  See you have Isaac. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=118.3s)]
*  He had 25 in the loss against Sacramento. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=120.1s)]
*  That was a good one for Sacramento. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=122.42s)]
*  See the drafts already gotten hard because there's so many guards. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=125.82s)]
*  I'm going to take Herb Jones as a forward. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=136.34s)]
*  Excellent pick. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=139.62s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=140.66s)]
*  I'm just continually, he has these little plays during the game that aren't things [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=142.06s)]
*  that you'll see on Twitter, but, um, it'll be plays like somebody will inbound the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=148.3s)]
*  ball. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=154.46s)]
*  It'll be five seconds left on the shot clock. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=154.7s)]
*  The ball will be out of bounds and somebody will throw it into somebody 25 feet from [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=156.46s)]
*  the basket and Herb Jones will know, Oh, this guy has four seconds to take a shot [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=160.5s)]
*  to get a three off and he's going to do some sort of up fake and then shoot it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=165.86s)]
*  I'm not going to fall for the up fake and he's going to know that I'm going to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=171.26s)]
*  challenge and the guy will just be like frozen for four to five seconds and then [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=174.18s)]
*  the whole finally throw it off the shot clock. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=179.22s)]
*  Cause Herb Jones just kind of knows what the dude is going to do. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=181.46s)]
*  I'm constantly in love with that guy as a role player, as a defender, as just a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=184.46s)]
*  weapon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=191.18s)]
*  Like in the playoffs, I feel like he's going to be a 35 minute a game guy, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=192.46s)]
*  Rosilla. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=195.54s)]
*  I love them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=197.02s)]
*  Love them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=197.7s)]
*  I mean, the Paul George block alone, that block doesn't happen in NBA games. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=198.14s)]
*  I don't know if I already talked about it with you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=202.66s)]
*  I probably talked to my, my podcast. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=203.98s)]
*  I'm stuttering now cause I'm still so shook by it, but somebody, Paul George's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  height wide open three, at the top of the key, that shot doesn't get blocked. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=210.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=214.42s)]
*  Doesn't get blocked like that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=214.66s)]
*  And he, he flew out, contested and blocked it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=216.38s)]
*  Like nobody ever thinks like you would just reset it, dribble, whatever. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=219.14s)]
*  And so George is like, I got this and he didn't. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=222.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  Great pick. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=226.17999999999998s)]
*  I think some people would be confused by going like, wait a minute. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=227.17999999999998s)]
*  How's Rudy go bear? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=229.62s)]
*  How does her Silas guy won by Yama? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=231.38s)]
*  Did you see the highlight the other day at two guys declining invitations to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  layups? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=235.98s)]
*  How are you not doing this? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  But where's the lack of depth? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=238.98s)]
*  Where do I need to go? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=240.94s)]
*  Um, I can't believe Isaac's gone. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=243.33999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to stay in Orlando. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=246.9s)]
*  I'm taking genuine sucks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=247.82s)]
*  He was the other one I was looking at. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  It's a great pick. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=254.3s)]
*  Can he win defensive player of the year for you? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=257.14s)]
*  He won't, but let's say he won. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=259.06s)]
*  Would you be upset about it? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=261.14s)]
*  Not watching him snake through screens, but I just don't know how any guard [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=264.02s)]
*  could ever be as valuable as somebody at the rim. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=268.54s)]
*  I just don't think you can be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=270.58s)]
*  And that's why I still don't think Marcus Mark should have won. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=274.74s)]
*  Do you rose? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=277.38s)]
*  I'm glad Marcus won. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  I think I swung the momentum that year. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=279.42s)]
*  I did the first, why can't Marcus smart when the defensive player of the year [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  segment, you were the first, I got the boat going. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=285.42s)]
*  Some people hopped on and then we took off for defensive player of the year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=288.66s)]
*  Alan. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=291.7s)]
*  Uh, I am taking Victor Wembed Yama at center. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=294.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=299.5s)]
*  No problem. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=299.74s)]
*  Because he's now routinely blocking six to eight blocks of game. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  Let's see here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  I feel like the problem with these segments is we're both competitive and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  there's just long stretches of silence as we try to figure out the best team [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=316.46s)]
*  possible. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=319.62s)]
*  So I apologize to the listeners. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=320.78s)]
*  This is why I've been on one movie draft with Sean and I was terrible at it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=322.82s)]
*  because I got two of them on the first one. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  And I was terrible at it because I got too competitive. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=328.42s)]
*  No, that's fine. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=331.58s)]
*  I just didn't contribute to the podcast for like 10 minutes stretches. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  Nope. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=336.46s)]
*  We're, we're okay. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=336.74s)]
*  Cause I'm just, I'm looking at my, my depth. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  So so far you have Suggs and Isaac and I have Wemby and Herb Jones. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=340.9s)]
*  This is a battle. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=346.5s)]
*  But I think if I, if I play my cards right, I'm going to be in good shape. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=346.94s)]
*  I'm going to take drew holiday. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=350.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=352.62s)]
*  Now, did you see that clip that made the rounds last week of him doing like four [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=353.3s)]
*  different things inside of the same possession? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=358.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=361.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=363.02000000000004s)]
*  I sure did. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=363.18s)]
*  I think because they've been so good this year that you haven't had to see [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=364.38s)]
*  drew play like somebody on the ball stuff as intensely as he has at other moments. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=368.1s)]
*  But you know, that was the granted, there's a lot more goes into who you're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=375.1s)]
*  voting for with all this stuff in that clip, but like see, I think it's a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=379.22s)]
*  like seeing that clip in the brilliance of what he does and the different times [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=382.66s)]
*  he's been asked to take on centers. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=387.5s)]
*  I just think he's an incredible weapon at that position that, you know, that's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  why everybody always loves having this guy on the roster. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=395.62s)]
*  I love him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=399.90000000000003s)]
*  Part of the reason this team is going to end up with like 65 to 66 wins is [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=402.3s)]
*  cause all he wants to do is win games. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  It could care less how many shots it gets. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=409.14000000000004s)]
*  It's one of the many shots. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=410.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=411.86s)]
*  The shot doesn't care. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=412.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=413.9s)]
*  He just wants to help out and do winning stuff. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=414.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=418.62s)]
*  Well, I'm going to take Yanis at my other forward spot. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=421.5s)]
*  Yanis always gets overlooked in this all defense stuff. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=429.5s)]
*  I would say worst case scenario, if he's healthy, he's one of the best [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  four or five defensive players in the world. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=438.06s)]
*  He's one of the best four or five defensive players in the league [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=439.98s)]
*  year after year after year. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=442.26s)]
*  Doesn't really get the, uh, doesn't get the four blocks of game, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=444.94s)]
*  but teams are afraid of him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=447.86s)]
*  Nobody likes to drive and see him. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  He's incredible in transition and he's Yanis. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  So when he's showing on his, it's not like, not like that many people [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=457.26s)]
*  are ever switching into him, but nobody's like, oh, cool. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=461.38s)]
*  This guy now. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=469.22s)]
*  I'm really glad you did that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=470.42s)]
*  I thought I was going to, I thought you were going to fall into my trap. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  Now the momentum may have swung the other way. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  Um, with that pick, cause he just gets overlooked all the time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=476.54s)]
*  I, I'm pretty sure I'm voting him second for MVP this year. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=480.42s)]
*  I still almost, I had like a couple of weeks stretch where I was [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=483.38s)]
*  going to vote him MVP last year. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=485.5s)]
*  I'm not voting SGA ahead of him. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=491.90000000000003s)]
*  Unless you get no argument from this guy. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=494.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=495.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=496.26s)]
*  So if you watch him versus okay. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=496.98s)]
*  See today, I don't think you would say SGA is the number two MVP. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=499.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=504.06s)]
*  Um, I'm going to take Lou door at guard or six, small, small forward, small [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=504.54s)]
*  forward. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=512.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=513.26s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  Lou Dork got nailed in the face today and bled all over the court. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=518.9s)]
*  That was the kind of day for okay. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=522.9s)]
*  See, we need more information. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=524.46s)]
*  I love Lou Dork. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=527.3s)]
*  Um, I still, so I have Wimby Herb Jones and Giannis. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=530.78s)]
*  I have all my guard spots left. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  I can't believe it a longer day, which, which leads me to, uh, the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  one, the only Alex Caruso. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=542.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=546.02s)]
*  So you've got your white guy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=546.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=552.38s)]
*  You re you know what? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=552.66s)]
*  I am going to take him at my white guy spot. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=553.5s)]
*  I think he could be part of your regular spot too. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=557.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=559.78s)]
*  You know what? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=560.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to, it's going to be a TBD. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=560.54s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  One of the values of Caruso is he's a swing guy. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=565.0999999999999s)]
*  You can swing them at guard. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=567.3399999999999s)]
*  You can swing them into the white guy spot. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=568.42s)]
*  He's eligible in two positions. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=569.9399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=572.74s)]
*  That scares me. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=572.98s)]
*  That scares me a little bit because then I have to take the next other [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=573.74s)]
*  white guy in the conversation and that's Hardenstein. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=576.3s)]
*  So I can't have you take Caruso and then take hearts because then I don't even [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=578.86s)]
*  know what to do. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=583.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=585.3399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=585.62s)]
*  What a, what a time for Hardenstein. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=585.86s)]
*  Are the depth for our people is not great right now defensively. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=588.7800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=594.86s)]
*  I got a spot for a guy who I think gets no credit for how good of a defensive [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=597.34s)]
*  player he is, but he's fucking awesome. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=604.98s)]
*  And he hops into passing lanes. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=608.58s)]
*  I think as well as anybody in the league, Shay Gilgis Alexander. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=610.62s)]
*  I'm putting a guard. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=615.14s)]
*  Reach. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=616.86s)]
*  He made his bones on defense. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=617.46s)]
*  I still think he's really good at it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=620.98s)]
*  I don't think guys like going against him and, uh, he's my first guard. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=622.7s)]
*  Cause I think I'll be able to get my other guard next. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=629.22s)]
*  You're basically, you only have center and forward left. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=632.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=635.7s)]
*  See, I felt like I had to go guards early cause I liked the forward depth better. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=635.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=639.94s)]
*  But when you went, you're honest. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=640.86s)]
*  Cause I, I'm, we agree that I, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=643.02s)]
*  one awesome forward left though. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=646.62s)]
*  There is. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=649.3000000000001s)]
*  There is. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=651.3000000000001s)]
*  And you're going to take them right now or are you going to wait on go bear? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=652.14s)]
*  No, I'm taking Jayden McDaniels now. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=655.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=656.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=657.0600000000001s)]
*  How about his jumper today? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=660.5400000000001s)]
*  I was like, are you seriously with two on ant? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=662.78s)]
*  You're going to, he's got, he's got one of those in him, like every tight game. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=664.6600000000001s)]
*  He's like, I'm shooting this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=669.62s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm shooting this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=671.02s)]
*  He's in the, he's there. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=672.46s)]
*  No, no. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=673.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=673.5400000000001s)]
*  Guy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=673.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=674.62s)]
*  He had one today. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=675.14s)]
*  I, uh, I've changed my opinion on Minnesota a couple of times this year. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=677.14s)]
*  Cool. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=682.34s)]
*  I think defensively where I've landed now on March 24th, I think defensively I [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=682.78s)]
*  could, I could see them getting there. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=688.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't think anyone's beating Denver, but I do at least feel comfortable [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=690.58s)]
*  enough in their backbone and defense and what I've seen from Edwards, which [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=694.26s)]
*  we didn't talk about today. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=697.58s)]
*  Edwards in that golden state game. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=699.26s)]
*  Second quarter wasn't like an unbelievable stats game for him, but he's just making [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=701.38s)]
*  better passing decisions over and over and over again in these games. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=704.9s)]
*  He's just, there's a sophistication that he has since towns went out that I [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=708.46s)]
*  don't remember seeing before towns went out. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=712.38s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=715.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=716.82s)]
*  But I think he's had very early on. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=717.02s)]
*  It was okay. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=720.1s)]
*  He's driving and thinking about making a play still. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=720.9s)]
*  And that's rare with the young scores that are that good. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=723.9s)]
*  Like, Hey, I'm getting into the hoop and I'm supposed to be thinking about somebody [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=727.26s)]
*  else and just think the level he'd be at statistically if he flopped all the time. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=730.62s)]
*  But he doesn't. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=737.5s)]
*  And he got to play today where in the fourth quarter he had a play. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=738.4599999999999s)]
*  He was driving hard on the left. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=741.9399999999999s)]
*  And I feel like a year ago, he just would have surged in and tried to get a [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=745.06s)]
*  layup off our runner and instead he just kind of kept going, rode the baseline [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=748.18s)]
*  and found the dude in the corner and got a three. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=752.3s)]
*  And I just, I don't think he would have done it six months ago. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=754.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=758.1800000000001s)]
*  By the way, Alexander Walker's defense to you throw him into the mix. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=758.46s)]
*  And I thought like Nas Reed, part of the reason why he wasn't drafted is people [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=762.14s)]
*  thought like, okay, what is he laterally like, and he's, he carried him in the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=765.66s)]
*  first half today. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=771.78s)]
*  I know ant had the second quarter, but Nas, some of the help defense that he's [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=773.5s)]
*  showing now that cat's not out there. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=778.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=781.26s)]
*  So that's a lot to ask. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=781.54s)]
*  Cause I wonder how much people teams are just going to absolutely load up on [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=784.62s)]
*  Edwards, but it means that, you know, Kyle Anderson was the guy Golden [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=787.02s)]
*  States shows to ignore today. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=790.3s)]
*  And at times I was like, okay, this is going to win Golden State the game. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=792.66s)]
*  And it wasn't so I'll take Jayden. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=795.74s)]
*  Like him to cut down on some of the, like the one or two awful fouls a game, but [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=797.86s)]
*  he's, uh, he's so good against the best players on the ball. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=801.62s)]
*  It looks like. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=804.34s)]
*  The main, I'm going to take Derek white, who probably should have gone a little [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=805.22s)]
*  bit sooner than this. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=811.54s)]
*  I've never seen a guard protect the rim like him since like Dennis Johnson, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=812.66s)]
*  growing back to like the eighties. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  Um, he's always in the right spots. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=818.38s)]
*  He's just a really smart all around team defender. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=820.1s)]
*  He can guard a bunch of guys. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=824.1s)]
*  He can guard bigger guys and him and drew together has been a joy to watch [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=826.14s)]
*  and a huge reason why this team is so good. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=829.5s)]
*  So Derek weight. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=831.78s)]
*  I'll take Rudy go bear. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=835.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=839.22s)]
*  Um, can I get a Tara Tara Taris and ruling for my sixth man? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=841.98s)]
*  He's out for the year. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=849.02s)]
*  Can I still take them? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=849.7s)]
*  He was under 20 minutes, right? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=852.3000000000001s)]
*  Was he under 20? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=854.26s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=856.62s)]
*  Oh, he's at 21.8. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=859.74s)]
*  I can't take them then. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=860.14s)]
*  Shit. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=862.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=865.3000000000001s)]
*  Take grant Williams. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=867.54s)]
*  Is here is grant Williams under he's, is he under 20 minutes again? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=876.86s)]
*  No, no, he's like 30 now for Charlotte. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=879.82s)]
*  No, I'll take, I would allow it though. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=882.94s)]
*  I would allow it only with him though. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=885.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=889.5s)]
*  This is tough. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=892.3000000000001s)]
*  I think Tari's close enough. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=893.42s)]
*  I'll take, if I have to go under 20 minutes, can I take is, would you [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=896.0600000000001s)]
*  laugh if I took all Verada? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=899.58s)]
*  Under 20 minutes is tough. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=905.82s)]
*  I probably shouldn't have made under 25 minutes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=907.14s)]
*  I'm taking Terry Easton. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=909.34s)]
*  He's heard anyway. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=910.38s)]
*  Makes my team look better. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=912.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=914.0600000000001s)]
*  So you have go bear McDaniels, Lou Dort, Drew and Suggs, Isaac. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=914.34s)]
*  Who's the pick of the draft and the number one pick and heart and steam. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=922.4200000000001s)]
*  I have one Benyama, Herb Jones, Yannis, SGA, Derek, white Tari's and Alex [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=926.1400000000001s)]
*  Crusoe is my white guy and now we bring in Steve Cerruti who's going to tell us. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=932.0200000000001s)]
*  Who won and it's not going to be a shocker since you took both Orlando magic. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=937.5400000000001s)]
*  Uh, Cerruti who won the draft? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=943.34s)]
*  I mean, this, this is a pointless exercise. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=945.98s)]
*  I think you got the two best defenders that aren't centers in the league and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=948.5s)]
*  Suggs and Isaac, and I'll rest my case there. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=952.06s)]
*  Isaac going one though is wild. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't even know that I, I probably would have done it because I'm a huge [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=957.3s)]
*  Homer, but I don't even know if it's the right pick, but I love that you went there. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=960.78s)]
*  Well, for the six man spot, the distance between Isaac and whoever the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=963.86s)]
*  number two six man was, was massive. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=968.06s)]
*  That's why, when you told me I had the number one pick, like I wrote down my [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=972.3399999999999s)]
*  board and I was like, I need to get Isaac first because I figured you would take [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=975.34s)]
*  him because the sixth man thing to be able to plug that guy in. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=980.82s)]
*  Cause I look at my list here. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=984.38s)]
*  I go, Hey, could I be a little small with Jayden is my power forward and Doris, my [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=985.86s)]
*  small forward and Suggs and drew like, wait, what if, could I be, Oh wait, I'm [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=990.62s)]
*  bringing in Jonathan Isaac to destroy souls and putting them in front of Rudy [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=994.7s)]
*  Gobert. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=998.62s)]
*  I like my, my team. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=999.9399999999999s)]
*  I could have the Wemby Herb Jones, Yannis, and then my SGA white and Alex [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1002.54s)]
*  Crusoe three, three guard back court. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1007.78s)]
*  Film pretty good about that. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1010.66s)]
*  No, I gotta be honest. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1012.06s)]
*  Wemby's I might even vote for bills. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1013.02s)]
*  I gotta be honest. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1016.3399999999999s)]
*  If you take away sucks and Isaac, I think bill, I think bill might have a better [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1016.9399999999999s)]
*  team. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1021.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1022.18s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1022.38s)]
*  I think SGA is a little overrated defensively. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1022.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1025.86s)]
*  What's the case for that? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1026.34s)]
*  I just said it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1029.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snDS0PUpAEM&t=1030.98s)]
