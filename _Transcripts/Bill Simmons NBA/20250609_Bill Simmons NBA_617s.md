# Why SGA is a Different Kind of NBA Star | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q)
*  You know, it's two small markets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  It's two teams we don't have a lot of familiarity with. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=2.36s)]
*  And it's a league that we've talked about many times in this podcast that has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=4.64s)]
*  refused to push the next generation of teams because they're just putting the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=7.76s)]
*  old stars on over and over and over again, in the biggest spots. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=12.24s)]
*  These are two teams that we knew were good heading into the season. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=15.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  So he was on TV. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=20.52s)]
*  Decent amount. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=23.12s)]
*  I don't think Indiana was, but you know, you kind of learned these guys through [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=24.16s)]
*  the playoffs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=28.08s)]
*  Um, and I don't think the league, you know, if you're going to criticize the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=29.48s)]
*  league on anything, it's just not pushing the younger teams that they know are [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=32.56s)]
*  going to be good. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=37.24s)]
*  We knew these teams are going to be good. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=37.72s)]
*  And I don't think they were on TV enough. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=39.88s)]
*  Would that have changed the rating? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=41.32s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=42.4s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=43.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  No, cause I mean, as great as SGA is and you know, I think tonight was really [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=45.64s)]
*  special and I think it was a really special game that it wasn't just the scoring. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=50.24s)]
*  It was like, okay, this guy's at another level than the other nine guys, whoever [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=55.31999999999999s)]
*  the other nine guys are that are out there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=59.36s)]
*  And so it's just nice, you know, it's nice if they get this to have something [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=61.64s)]
*  like that in this MVP season, have that kind of game on his resume in the biggest [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=64.72s)]
*  spot, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  And there's still going to be bigger spots. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=68.44s)]
*  We'll see what happens, but he's a really quiet dude. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, he's not, he's not going in, in, like he's great for franchise to be the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=73.12s)]
*  face your franchise cause you're just not dealing with any bullshit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=82.72s)]
*  Sometimes the bullshit brings people in and the, you know, I think we all like [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=82.92s)]
*  drama and this league has become so popular in a way that's unlike the other [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=89.52s)]
*  leagues and I'm not, I'm not talking about ratings, but just like the daily [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  consciousness of it and certainly you and I are far too in it, so maybe we're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=99.08s)]
*  not even great gauges with this, but the amount of like nonsense that we spend [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=102.8s)]
*  hours talking about, which is actually just good because there's an awareness [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=107.56s)]
*  of this league. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=110.84s)]
*  These are two teams. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=112.08s)]
*  Like there's no nonsense and that's awesome for the coaching staff. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=113.36s)]
*  It's awesome for the locker room, but there's not really this, like, it doesn't [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=117.52s)]
*  feel like there's anything necessarily at stake other than the championship. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=123.16s)]
*  And for those secondary viewers, there's, there's probably just a lot of boredom. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=126.36s)]
*  Be like, Oh, so they're best players, like incredibly efficient with pull up [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=131.12s)]
*  jumpers and the free throw thing hasn't been an issue really. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=135.6s)]
*  I don't think at all. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=138.8s)]
*  I mean, the third core is a free throw, a free free throw fest either both [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=139.4s)]
*  going both ways, but you know what I mean? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=144.56s)]
*  Like there isn't, there isn't this like big engaging personality, which again, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=146.52s)]
*  is great if you have to work every day with these people, but the, the next day [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  stuff and, and getting your mom to be like, what's on TV. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=158.16s)]
*  It's, it's not a great matchup for that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Which we, my daughter, my daughter came and watched game two with me and I [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=165.8s)]
*  don't think she looked up more than like five times. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=169.08s)]
*  She was just on her phone. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  It's just, I think that's what it's probably going to be for casual viewers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a good point on SGA. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=177.08s)]
*  He just does everything really well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  He was awesome tonight and not awesome in like, you know, there's those two ways [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=180.24s)]
*  of being awesome in NBA game and he's like in the quiet, efficient, almost [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  like a Greg Maddox just getting guys out. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=190.8s)]
*  Um, not, not doing like the 17 strikeouts. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=193.68s)]
*  This episode is presented by State Farm. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=198.56s)]
*  It's no secret that great teams need great teammates. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=200.8s)]
*  I've been saying this for years. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=203.56s)]
*  And when it comes to insurance, State Farm is there to help you find the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=204.88s)]
*  right coverage for your home car and more, whether you need an in-person or [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=207.56s)]
*  a digital assist, they're ready when life hits you with a full court press. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=211.52s)]
*  Get a game plan that helps fit your life. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Talk to State Farm today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=219.0s)]
*  State Farm with the assist coverage options are selected by the customer [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=220.96s)]
*  availability and the eligibility vary by state. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a, did you see that interview with him where he got asked the question [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  and he did the deep sigh and like search for the answer for like 10 seconds. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=232.16s)]
*  It was pretty interesting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=237.36s)]
*  So I forget, uh, I think it was Malika. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=239.28s)]
*  The asset was like, Oh man, like really what wanted to come up with a good [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=242.0s)]
*  answer for it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  It was just unusual because a lot of these guys are so media trained for [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=247.96s)]
*  moments like that, and these guys are still like getting used to being famous [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=251.44s)]
*  people, you know, she's famous. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=255.4s)]
*  I don't know, but he's a Canadian star who's been in the spotlight for a while, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=258.24s)]
*  but he's not like famous famous. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=262.92s)]
*  He's in a couple of commercials now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=265.04s)]
*  I don't think he's, I don't wouldn't say he's one of the 10 most famous [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=268.04s)]
*  players in the league right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=271.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's, that's bad if that's your MVP and I'm not being critical of them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=274.08s)]
*  I just don't know that there's, and this becomes like this kind of circular [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=278.2s)]
*  thing where it happens all the time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=282.32s)]
*  Like I always kind of, whether I've joked with you or other people that are in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=283.36s)]
*  this business with us, it's like, no one's ever lost a show because of them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  They've only lost a show because people didn't do enough to promote it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=294.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=295.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=296.6s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  That contract, I wasn't really into it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  Didn't like the producer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  So I was showing up. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=301.6s)]
*  I was giving you like my C plus game. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=302.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  And this oddly feels like I'm sort of saying something about someone specific, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=306.56s)]
*  but I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying anything specific. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm just saying that that's the norm is as soon as something's over, it'll be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=314.44s)]
*  like, oh, well, you know, I could have done this or this could be better. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=318.44s)]
*  The whole thing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=321.4s)]
*  And there there's, remember like the baseball stuff. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  It's like baseball's declining because they're not marketing their stars. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=324.76s)]
*  I've heard it with the WNBA. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  Like they don't market enough. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=329.67999999999995s)]
*  And I always wonder, it's like, well, if SGA is this buttoned up, but what are [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=331.56s)]
*  you supposed to do? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=339.64s)]
*  Like, is it because if OKC were on national TV 12 more times this year, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=341.36s)]
*  would the NBA finals ratings be better? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=346.24s)]
*  And I'm asking, I don't, I don't know the answer to that, but sometimes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=349.08s)]
*  Well, we just default to this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=353.44s)]
*  Well, the league should have done this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=355.52s)]
*  The leagues do a bad job here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=356.88s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=358.4s)]
*  Sometimes people just, they're just not interested. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=359.28s)]
*  They just might not be interested. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  There's nothing you can do. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=363.2s)]
*  I remember oh seven when LeBron made the finals against San Antonio and we were [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=365.24s)]
*  LeBron and was still pretty new, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=369.56s)]
*  It was like, I think his fourth season. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=371.04s)]
*  And the ratings for that finals were terrible because it was a mismatch and we [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=374.44s)]
*  didn't have a real history with LeBron yet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  And then he had his two MVP seasons in 2009 and 2010. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=380.0s)]
*  And that was when it was like going to be LeBron versus Kobe. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  And that became the storyline. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  And then LeBron didn't make the finals of the year. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=388.20000000000005s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  He, his shoe, I think the biggest selling shoe we ever had was 2011 after the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  decision, it was like he needed the soap opera, the decision to go to that next [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=398.04s)]
*  level for like people, like our parents to have opinions on them, you know, maybe [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  SGA, maybe he needs, maybe he needs like a, like a career polarization consultant. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=408.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=417.56s)]
*  But what's he going to do to man? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=417.68s)]
*  Like what could he possibly do? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  Like this is, this is actually the greatest compliment you can give somebody [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=421.12s)]
*  who's the face of a franchise is that it's so consistently every day is the same boring. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=424.0s)]
*  He's just an awesome teammate. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=430.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=431.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=432.08s)]
*  Can all, can all my teammates come in and do my interview with me? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=432.32s)]
*  I just want to like remind everyone listening, this is not even close to a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=435.44s)]
*  criticism, this is like all you could ever want out of, especially somebody that's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  young to be like this guy already gets it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=444.2s)]
*  And look, Jalen Williams did the media availability stuff before the finals even [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=446.35999999999996s)]
*  get started. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=450.12s)]
*  I was listening on NBA radio to his press conference, but I didn't know who it was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=450.72s)]
*  right away. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=454.72s)]
*  I thought it was like a 45 year old coach. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  Like who is this guy? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=459.2s)]
*  I was like, this guy's really, really impressive. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=460.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=463.08s)]
*  And then I had to like hit the screen because it was like, you know, your phone, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  it wasn't coming up right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=468.36s)]
*  And then boom, it's Jalen Williams. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=470.2s)]
*  And I'm thinking, my God, this guy's been in the league like just a few years and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  this is what he sounds like already. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=479.04s)]
*  Like these guys are so impressive. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=481.0s)]
*  He might need to do a Bret Hittman Hart did in the mid nineties. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=483.24s)]
*  What's cause he was, he was the champ. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=486.8s)]
*  Well, he was a good guy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=489.2s)]
*  He was the champ, but he was kind of like, you know, he was just a professional [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=490.0s)]
*  guy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=493.16s)]
*  He's very similar to SGA actually. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  Just very good at his job. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=494.68s)]
*  Canadian, always good matches. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=496.48s)]
*  And then they kind of leaned into how do we make them a villain? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=499.16s)]
*  And he started doing this kind of aggro Canadian guy thing and insulting, uh, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=501.76s)]
*  saying how Canada is better than America. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=506.68s)]
*  And then the fans were like, what? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=509.32s)]
*  And, uh, and that became kind of a thing that became his first night. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=511.48s)]
*  Maybe that's what SGA needs to do. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=514.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=517.6s)]
*  It's tough to play in America when Canada is obviously a superior country. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=524.76s)]
*  SGA is insulting America. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4sHjYDZu3Q&t=525.64s)]
