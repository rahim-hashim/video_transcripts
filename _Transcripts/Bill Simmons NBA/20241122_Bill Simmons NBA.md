# A Miserable 76ers Situation and Joel Embiid’s Sudden Career Crossroads  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNqtUKYil34)
*  Wouldn't be doing my job
*  If I didn't ask you what it's like to be a Philadelphia 76ers fan right now
*  you know what it's actually not as bad as you think because
*  It was a head-on collision and and like it was dead on impact. It's two and twelve
*  Yeah, like they could probably scratch and claw their way out of this but to me this season
*  They had a kind of like end of the season vibe in the second half against Memphis on Wednesday
*  House did you watch it? I couldn't look away. I watched the entire game. I think I watched every single minute of it. I
*  was going back and forth, but
*  It wasn't encouraging I
*  Still want to know
*  Why and bead is playing I still would like to know yeah, yeah walk us through this
*  What's the upside of not so all right they fuck up he plays the Olympics. They don't talk about it that that was a mistake
*  They fuck up they gave him a giant extension before the season so they didn't fuck up bill come on
*  They have to fucking give Joel and be the giant extension. Well. I think they fucked up that he wasn't
*  Obviously wasn't healthy
*  Yeah, but he hasn't been healthy his entire career. He's not been like a 100%
*  I feel perfect athlete so you fired up when they gave him an extension
*  I think that it's the price of doing business
*  I think like like and and I think bomber found out with why I mean I don't know what we're talking about
*  Well whatever you get we could they put themselves behind the eight ball the extension yeah, but then
*  Why throw him out there when he's obviously not healthy explain this to us
*  I can't explain it to you because this has been a hallmark of like the entire beat and beat experience where I
*  Think as fans especially this generation of fans of the Sixers are completely like okay with
*  Hey, we're gonna have to take some losses to make some gains
*  It's that's the whole point of the process was that this was gonna be this teardown to the studs and that we're gonna then build
*  Up with homegrown talent and bringing in free agents from acquiring guys through trade to help that homegrown talent gets to a title
*  We're exactly in the same place. We were when Doug Collins left, which is basically a second round basketball team and
*  We're aging now like we have changed the kind of
*  The sort of character of the team to where Joel MB is 30 he looks like he's 38
*  he might even look like he's 47 frankly and
*  like the guys that they have around him are largely veterans who were there on
*  Not necessarily mercenary contracts, but certainly like are there to win titles or get deep into playoffs
*  McCain then you have this whole other fun Sixers team where it's like but that's a maxi and yabba cell
*  That's the thing if if there was a 2 and 12 McCain and maxi team I
*  Think he would have been like oh, yeah, this is kind of weird and sucks
*  And we're pretty much out of it, but who knows like we're feisty and McCain's great
*  But instead with George who's now hyper extended his knee and is back out again and then bead
*  Doing the like daily and not even daily like hourly updates on like maybe I will maybe I won't I'm never gonna be 100%
*  I won't play back-to-backs, but I will if it's rolling for me, and I should be out
*  But I'm gonna come back in if they're just been like Joel MB tweaked something at the end of the Olympics
*  He's out for the first six weeks. I just think it's a completely different scenario
*  You agree that has of course of course it is this is to me the singular most
*  Battling aspect of this entire deal. I thought that the Sixers in terms of team building
*  Had a pretty successful summer they put all their chips in the middle
*  Well, I know you thought that because you took the over of 50 and a half wins remember that I stand by it
*  It wasn't wrong in the context of the information that was available. It was a simple
*  Idea I do think it was then
*  Desirable for them to try and finish among the top four teams in the East
*  Desirable right understanding of course that you're not gonna get a full season out of MP or a full season out of Paul George
*  You hope for most of a full season out of maxi and that you can weather the storm enough to get around
*  50 wins and finish in the top four in the East because all things being equal will be better to be have home court in
*  The first round then not but having said all that the thing that's baffling to me still doesn't have an answer is
*  What's with the drama mama? What are we talking about?
*  Just shut up. Well like you did a great job in the summer. You built the best team you could build
*  There is a closing window on on and bead we all agree there that a Joel and beat ain't gonna be playing
*  Professional basketball for another mother-effing decade. So you go all in and he's there's something happened
*  Something either at the Olympics after the Olympics something for the Olympics or before yeah, so we got to shut him down
*  Okay, shut him down shut him down and shut him up. That's it. There's nothing else to say. Why are we talking?
*  What is who benefits from the goddamn Daily Soap Opera's? Well, you know to the why are we talking thing?
*  It's literally why are we talking because all this stuff leaked out from that hour-long meeting where we come to find out the least surprising
*  piece of information
*  CR and recent
*  Sixers history, which is that Joel and be that the other players were upset about?
*  his accountability showing up late to meetings his practice habits and it was like
*  Yeah, I I'm not surprised by one aspect of this were you no
*  But I think that this is all about how it's getting framed right? So like if you change over
*  Two-thirds of your roster almost every season
*  You're not gonna be able to control the culture of the locker room
*  And if you bring in new faces who maybe don't have the same allegiances or the same
*  Relationships with guys in that locker room
*  They might just have like more incentive to say something to their agent who says something to shams whatever happened
*  Honestly, it feels like that literal part of maxi calling out and bead
*  Seems like it was kind of blown out of proportion, you know, like there was like what was their buddies, right?
*  Yeah, there are buddies and it sounds like at least from embed side of things
*  He was like that was 30 seconds of like a 30-minute meeting, you know
*  Like yeah you one person being like you gotta show up on time more and him being like you're right
*  I got to be better why Joel and beat is 30 and
*  Not showing up to shit on time and that that has become so detrimental to the team that it's getting out into an ESPN
*  Report and like other guys on the team clearly don't look at him as the alpha leader of the locker room and are okay with
*  Letting those details out of the locker room. Like that's a whole other conversation
*  But yeah, like the communication part of this has been awful from top to bottom
*  well, and then you have
*  Comparing his work ethic and ability to stay in shape versus some of the other best players in the league, right?
*  That's where it really jumps out and that's been the thing we've said on this podcast over and over again
*  He's competing against people like Janice and Tatum like LeBron and you're 22
*  Yeah, these guys that you know
*  This is their life is to stay in shape and be ready for seasons and you know not make excuses about stuff. I think
*  House and I are a little older than CR
*  We've seen a lot of centers hit this point and it usually doesn't end well
*  And that was the case I made before the season as you get older as you start carrying more weight as you have some injuries
*  and some injury history
*  Not a lot of evidence like we saw it happen. You had Andrew Bynum that year. I think he was
*  An all-star in 2012 and two years later is out of the league
*  Just when you're talking about these big seven foot two seven three bodies with extra weight
*  House that's where my mind went to some of the guys we've watched where it ends fast. Yeah, but the only thing that
*  Cuts against that is that it seemed like for the very first time in his career
*  It finally came out of his mouth that I think I should show up to the season in shape
*  I think this will be the season that I will choose and there was a kind of logic thread to it
*  He just surrounded himself with the upper of upper echelon a highest performing highest successful NBA players
*  Right. Usually there's a bump from that right the Olympic bump
*  What was is somehow lost because he did get that experience?
*  He was with all of those bright minds and very successful players with their own successful
*  Regiments and he did say afterwards. I am going to be the skinny guy
*  It's gonna be skinny and be I want to be like Tim Duncan. I want to have a thinner body
*  Yeah, Tim Duncan you needed to internalize probably was just not saying anything
*  You know what I mean? Like it's just they needed probably
*  to put a cap on the narration and the the interfacing with the press about like what his intentions are and where he is and
*  And it's honestly like it's weird hero ball stuff for him to be out there right now
*  And it's really unfortunate because what happens to him when he's not feeling great is his game becomes repulsive
*  It honestly becomes
*  Fucking nauseating to watch him play. Yeah, there's some guys really like oh look at him. He's gutting it out
*  You know what I mean? This is not Philip Rivers on a broken leg. This is I think he fell down what eight times last night
*  He's just flopping around and it
*  Right. He wears all of his emotions on his face good and bad and last night against Memphis was the all-time worst-case version of that
*  And it's just it this is not a together team
*  It's not being coached in a way that seems like the coach wants to be there
*  Maybe he does but this is not the Nick nurse that I thought the Sixers were getting that it's not the Nick nurse that coached
*  last year and
*  He seems super pissed about whatever the situation is
*  he
*  Seems disgruntled in every press conference. He seems
*  supremely annoyed with the press corps and then on top of that you got welcome to Philly. Yeah, but like
*  Honestly, man, no like it's every city is hard on a team that has expectations though, right?
*  like I mean the thing that I think is so
*  Jarring about this is that I almost wonder if it would be worse if they were four and seven
*  You know what I mean? Because it would be like why you're not quite playing up to expectations. This is a disaster
*  Well, I was looking at their schedule. They they lose every game by 10 to 20 points
*  I think they've had one close loss. Every other loss is a blowout
*  Yeah, their net differential is is fourth worst at the NBA that game yesterday
*  Which you know, they kind of fought back at the end because Memphis isn't good and also kind of fell asleep
*  Oh, by the way that game there
*  By Luke canard and Aldama and like they didn't have jaw or
*  Edie last night. So it's not like you can like be like, oh, well, we got taken out by three all NBA guys
*  It's like no you you lost to the B team Grizzlies
*  In a like kind of half full gym. Well the alarming thing about him B like it has what you said earlier about why?
*  Why so much talking why telling us?
*  Why you're feeling better you lose the weight to me it's like being CR one of our favorite movies the town
*  it's the Blake Lively character being like
*  Doggie, I quit drinking shining. I get to get an apartment. It's gonna be great. It's like I don't know if I trust this
*  Not to compare it beat to Blake Lively in the town, but I guess I just did
*  It's like that all sounds good. But can I can I see it for like a year?
*  Can I can I see skinny and bead can I see you play some back-to-back?
*  I just feel like the ship sailed what was crazy about last night the body language
*  The team just doesn't seem together at all
*  the bench seemed like they're really trying to like cheer baskets and stand up and
*  Do the good chemistry thing but on the court it was a mess and I
*  Noticed this last year with the bead during the next series and I remember talking about it on the pod now
*  So I think you and I talked about it
*  he's
*  Just really slow
*  To the ball now and rebounds and shop block stuff
*  And I don't know whether his knees are just like he's carrying too much weight their shot
*  He can't move quickly anymore. It is a quick burst stuff
*  This was we also saw that in the Olympics
*  Which is why I think they were so hesitant to play him in certain situations. He gets killed on the offensive boards now
*  There's guys flying around if you if you put him in a pick and roll and he has to run out to a shooter
*  He can't and over and over again you watch it's not just that they're losing
*  The offense that these teams are getting combined with the offensive rebounds that they can get I think is the most alarming thing to me
*  It's he can still get his points
*  I feel like he can always get to 25 or 30
*  But the other side of the ball is the alarming part to me, but on
*  Honestly, dude on paper with all due respect house. They're not the Wizards like they shouldn't be 2 and 12 like
*  Entire East maxi, I know they've missed time each
*  but like
*  there's been
*  stretches of time over the last five seasons with the Sixers where the Sixers have been able to weather
*  Three weeks five weeks without a need and stay in the kind of like middle of the pack in the Eastern Conference
*  Mutiny like a roll with it
*  well
*  They played Brooklyn on Friday night at home
*  They play the Clippers on Sunday at home the revenge of James Harden
*  I almost think they're better off not playing at home
*  Then they play the Houston pitbulls on Wednesday
*  Which is just a nightmare game talk about a team that plays hard and has athletes and is is relentless
*  That's a team. I don't want to play and then they're at Detroit on November 30
*  It does think the nurse make it out of the month for you. Oh, of course. I mean, of course really
*  What's the thesis for getting rid of Nick nurse like what like how is that gonna help?
*  He's not the one under the Rob Polinko law things are going wrong
*  It's got to be somebody else's fault. Who else are you gonna blame? They can't get rid of
*  George not a blame. There's nothing to blame. It's November. Well, you know the the season that matters
*  Starts in March there. They're forecasted win total right now is 38 and a half
*  Yes, it is
*  42 and a half two days ago. Well, it's
*  Four ways
*  But I'm telling you there are only a couple slots out of the ten seed
*  Yeah dead last in the Eastern Conference right now as we're taping but only a handful of spots away and
*  They right now have the seventh best odds to make the playoffs
*  It's minus two fifteen for the sixers to make the play. Oh shit
*  So those odds weren't even on Fando like three hours ago when I was taping so CR the people demand
*  And short these guys
*  Yeah, but they're not I don't think they're gonna be in the top six so
*  Agreed basically the cutoff would be the ten seed CR, right? So you have to finish above five teams
*  So I'm gonna list some teams
*  Like you'll finish ahead of Washington no matter what happens you too much talent that's happening. Sorry house
*  Way to go out on a limb you'll finish ahead of Toronto because I don't I don't think Toronto even necessarily wants to be good
*  so that's a second one I
*  Think you'll finish ahead of Charlotte I do too. So there's three
*  Then it starts getting little gamey like you have Chicago that you catch Chicago on the right night and they can score
*  You know they can score with anybody they look
*  Okay, you'd have to pass
*  Detroit and
*  Brooklyn you'd have to pass two of those three the trait right now is seven and nine and they're in these games and
*  Kate is playing better than anyone on the Sixers
*  Can you get to a ten seed?
*  I think you can get to a ten seed
*  I think that that's gonna be so far below the expectations of the franchise at this point that it's gonna still be seen as an
*  abject failure this is not I
*  Don't think that this team had like Miami Heat expectations this season where it's like what they do is basically use the regular season as a
*  Like a experiment, you know and whether all these storms and spo is making guys from G leaguers into all-stars
*  And it's just gonna
*  They're gonna scrape and claw their way into the playoffs and then nobody wants to play them
*  I think this is a team that was really hoping to have some kind of home court advantage in the playoffs and
*  Also probably to be so safe in that that they could rest guys down the stretch and make sure and bead was healthy
*  that's the so now it's the opposite and I think like I
*  Think now what happened with that?
*  Meeting coming out becoming public is the problem is is that everything seems like a reaction to something else?
*  So losing to Memphis which sucked anyway
*  Is now a failure of the meeting to galvanize the team, right?
*  So like instead of it just being like, uh, you lost on the road to Memphis what a shitty started the season
*  But hopefully everybody starts to get get it together. It's now like that meeting didn't work
*  Right and bead looked miserable. He immediately comes out after the Memphis game and says whoever leaked that is a real piece of shit
*  Presumably the person in the lot as somebody in the locker room did that so that's what is happening in that locker room
*  George goes out George does a podcast about the the all-hands meeting
*  The team meeting. Oh, he did that I missed that part. He did apparently yeah, I haven't listened to it yet
*  I just saw a house was just showing me the the
*  thumbnail from it definitely
*  It's like I my recommendation would be for Joel and be to go out and not play for four weeks this four to six weeks
*  And get as healthy as he can because him being like I'm gonna try and drag my body through
*  35 minutes against now
*  Is not they need to win like 34 games so just send him packing and make sure he gets in shape
*  I thought he looked so miserable last night when that and when the halftime hit and he just walked off
*  Yeah, and it was like he was like a tennis player. All right, here we go house CR feel free to weigh in as well
*  Are we sure Nick nurse is good?
*  Can I just walk through I'm willing to say yes, he's good, but can we just walk through it?
*  So he takes over a Toronto team that went 59 and 23 in
*  2019 they went 58 and 24
*  They win on that kawaii shot last second. Sorry Chris
*  Lebron's in the West. It's the first year Lebron leaves they play the Warriors in the finals
*  Katie's hurt doesn't come back to game five immediately blows out as Achilles clay Thompson gets hurt same game. They get this miracle
*  Kawaii performance and they squeeze it out and we're like Nick nurse is a good coach and I think he probably is a decent to good coach
*  next year 53 wins
*  next year
*  27 wins
*  48 41 gets fired from there goes to Philly the year after
*  Has that really weird Nick series and then looks completely miserable this year
*  I just I wonder if there's like only four or five good coaches period and I thought maybe he was one of them
*  But I think what we're learning is he probably wasn't house your thoughts
*  I think what you're speaking to and I think is a fair criticism of him is
*  his ability to to rally his ability to
*  You know get guys on the same page with a common cause because the story about why Toronto fell apart
*  had to do with a
*  Defensive scheme where they had a whole bunch of guys they didn't have one tall guy on that team on that roster
*  They had all had to go, you know
*  baseline to baseline side to side full out
*  defensive pressure
*  Extended way out to the three-point line and at some point they all got effing tired of it
*  And they went to coach Nick nurse and said god damn it coach Nick nurse. You're this is exhausting. We can't
*  Expend all of this energy playing all this defense in this way and it fell on deaf ears and they were like
*  Hey, guess what Nick nurse fuck you, right?
*  That goes to Philly scene, you know that not like last year and I was thinking about that Toronto team because it's
*  Such a weird outlier right they had great defense, right? They've Kawhi who's actually healthy. They have Marcus all rim protection
*  They have Kyle Lowry. They have siakam. They have an anobio that didn't have in the playoffs that year Danny green
*  They'd wings that a Baca
*  But really they had Kawhi who we left that playoffs thinking this is the best player in the world
*  and we've seen coaches that have great situations like that and
*  I just wonder like like when they hired him CR and we talked about I was like, wow, you got Nick nurse
*  That guy's yeah, cuz it was like there was and it was like is he you know, we're gonna lose him to the Bucs
*  There was like a whole like Nick nurse is the hottest free agent Nick. There's sweepstakes. Yeah
*  Not sure there'd be a sweepstakes. This is my point. I
*  Don't really know. I don't really know
*  What Eric's bolster just do a better job here like what probably not?
*  What can a coach do when you're when the the main issue seems to be effort?
*  Well, the big issue is it doesn't seem like he can 100% connect with them bead as we've seen
*  basically from all of them beads
*  resume this season
*  Yeah, but I think there's a there everybody gets a little piece of blame pie, you know
*  Be talking about you won't go blame pie. We're doing a we're doing a ESPN gimmick. I like the and bead deserves a slice
*  Darrell deserves a slice Paul George deserves a slice Nick nurse deserves a slice
*  You know like and be can't stop saying stupid shit. That's a huge problem, but that's probably more of a fan problem
*  I would imagine that it is. Yeah
*  That it is a player problem. I just think that this looks like a team that hates each other and I honestly I
*  Was trying to rack my brains, I mean I you can look up it's like oh who's 2 and 12 and still makes the playoffs
*  It's like not that many teams six out of 92. I look right but it's now that the playoffs have been expanded but more than that
*  You just don't really see teams. They clearly dislike each other this much doing anything like yeah, there are you
*  Do they really dislike each other?
*  Like a happy team I think is a very fair point. Yeah, they don't seem happy playing basketball together, right?
*  Right, and I don't think any of the guys
*  nobody on that team
*  Except for Jared McCain is playing in the plus they're not playing and wow we never expected that but Jared McCain
*  Him and connect are like the two big success stories of the draft so far. It seems like it's not like
*  George's looks terrible even when he's not being dragged off the court maxi's obviously hurt drum and looks old
*  You know like the Kaila there's no signs that drum in my
*  Yeah, no signs that how he might not have it anymore. Yeah, so here's the thing CR they like
*  They crushed the McCain pick they get Caleb Martin at a huge discount
*  He was the only guy who was flying around my I actually thought he was really good last night and
*  Yabba Sally was a really good site
*  They added three guys to the rotation that doesn't matter or awesome guys and it hasn't mattered at all and bead
*  Right the whole entire thing runs through and beat especially if Paul George is gonna be this passive
*  That's one thing that's been sad
*  Is that like because he got hurt in the preseason and because like he's just re-injured himself
*  There's been no opportunity to be like hey man Paul
*  We're gonna need you to carry us for the first 20 games of the season
*  You know you're gonna have to go out and get 25 a night. You're gonna have to be a lead scorer
*  You're gonna have to take the best player on the opposing team on defense, and he's just completely come
*  The terrifying thing is like this is why they look the Clippers let him go
*  Yeah, probably saw this coming like I covered this in part one
*  It's like buying the buying the used car from somebody who's really eager to sell to you. It's probably red flag
*  but have you ever had a
*  Celtic season in recent memory we did we the second Kyrie season you can see it the whole season
*  It's like it's off
*  This is off, but I talked about this when I did the power pole a couple weeks ago about
*  When the concept of sacrifice when you're putting together a big three and
*  How like when people always point to the oh wait Celtics where it was like those guys were at the point of their career
*  Where they're ready to give something up this time around you'd have to have been bead
*  What's he given up and does he want to get in shape you Paul George?
*  She was probably the most likely candidate to be like yeah, I don't care if I score all the time
*  I just want to win a title and then you have maxi who's trying to prove. He's a great player
*  You know he doesn't want to sacrifice anything he shouldn't want to he's a young player is trying to prove that
*  He's one of the best guards in the league so that alone made me nervous
*  But then the in bead conditioning and then the chemistry is I think the variables even house couldn't have expected as he went over
*  fifty and a half wins
*  I'm gonna cross that off house for you. I will take that L
*  It's literally why it's called gambling, but it was exactly what Chris Ryan just described
*  It was Paul George holding down the fort through the first 20 games to Paul George and maxi in the East
*  You know building a little that with McCain
*  Yeah, right right a little something, but he showed up dead and and he was hurt within days of us doing
*  over under podcasts and I maybe he's not I
*  Mean after last night's injury, maybe he's he's still not you know restored to full health
*  Mean well, can it hopefully he can still podcast
*  the thing I was gonna say ask the thing I was asking you about like the historical precedents or if you have this experience where
*  It's been a very long time with the Sixers since a season started
*  I remember like the first car I ever had was a 91 Ford tempo
*  used 91 Ford tempo and
*  The transmission blew out on the drive home from the dealership yeah, and it was just like well that is definitive
*  This is a lemon. Let's take it back to the lot like they clearly
*  There's got to be some like 12-hour grace period this wasn't like oh, I'm driving it for a while and
*  Shudders a little bit when you make lefts
*  You know no there was no like warning signs this thing died as soon as it left the season opening gate
*  And it kind of almost feels like a little liberating
*  After all these years of like kind of coming up short is like oh, there's something rotten here
*  And maybe this this beginning is the beginning of a new chapter
*  We have to like kind of new chapter you just signed a beat to an extension and Paul George has a four-year deal
*  What your chapter are we looking at?
*  The new chapter what are you going to get a hybrid eight like a bear
*  My post sixers life
*  Maybe you'll have more more time now to concentrate on other things
*  Isn't there a pathway or it'll be fun to root for 39 wins isn't that gonna become the new like okay?
*  We understand we take well. There's another there's another piece of this bad luck. Let's be honest
*  They they have their pick
*  And but it's top six protected ah
*  Yeah
*  So you can't even root for like let's just bottom out
*  I should be really fun to root for McCain
*  Maxi and and and the role players it would be fine. They're too good to bottom out. Yeah
*  McCain is is honestly worth watching the Sixers for
*  Even if you also have to watch guys rolling around on the ground in agony
*  How's do we do we need to convene the ewing theory committee?
*  to just should I send them to Philly to watch what the sixers might look like if they have to shelve and beat for
*  Three weeks and all of a sudden that team is playing small ball and take it off
*  I don't know it because we had a pretty good sample size for that last season
*  Played 39 games they were bad they were bad at the kids and he didn't play
*  How much better would you guys feel about this team or would we even be doing this segment if they had won like three more?
*  games
*  Still bad, but just a slow start
*  So I think the two games this week
*  Warned this statement because it wasn't just that words this segment. It wasn't just a Memphis game last night, which was riveting
*  The Miami game was unbelievable. I mean that was they got blow the FL. Yeah, we're still have texted me
*  He was like I'm not saying I hate watch pod of Sixers games would do well
*  But I do think it would get an audience. I think he's right
*  I think you could you could basically take the Philly special and just make it like a venting session after every sixer game
*  But it might yeah, you might and it rarely happens in basketball because it's the most naked sport right in football
*  They have helmets on they might not show some of the sidelines in basketball
*  You know when guys are unhappy, you know when guys are mailing in a play or a sequence
*  You can watch the reactions on the bench. You can watch how the bench reacts
*  You can see the coach in the postgame, you know press conference
*  There's like 40 checkpoints where you're like, ah, this doesn't look right and they're hitting all of them
*  I can't think of a single one. They're not hitting other than that. McCain seems super happy to be in the NBA
*  He's like, hey guys. He's like a puppy running around
*  Yeah, it's like when we got Murph and he's just running around the back
*  This is not maxi loses that joy because that's
*  That's the other thing that's gonna happen over the last couple of seasons
*  I think that that's been really important for Sixers fans is to see somebody who plays with so much unbridled
*  Pleasure, you know because it sometimes doesn't feel that way for him beat and honestly like to me as much as the health stuff is
*  Obviously pretty disturbing with him and the way he's talked about
*  Conserving his body for the playoffs and what it's gonna take and you know, he's never a hundred percent and all that
*  he has said multiple things about
*  Basically say like the amount that I've given to this city if because of how much I've done for this team because of the amount
*  I've given to the city. It's ridiculous that this is like the discourse on me. So I
*  I'm just I'm
*  This is getting kind of dark, you know what I mean? I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen
*  I don't know even Darryl. This would be the team that Darryl had always dreamed of right? It's like you
*  Yeah, you get the on paper stars
*  Yeah shooting and and and veterans who know what their role is and a really astute coach and if that doesn't work
*  I don't I don't really know what the plan is here, you know house
*  They can't even trade and bead until the summer if they wanted to I don't think they do but
*  Build a new arena so keep that in mind with the bead trades
*  It's weird because the bronze did that whole thing this week about how social media is too negative and the whole discussion and apparatus
*  Around basketball has become too negative. I feel like it hasn't really been that
*  different I think the only thing that probably has been added the last couple years of these player podcasts where the players are
*  Especially the X players. They're like pro wrestlers, you know, it's like Mick Foley talking about how
*  The Undertaker was a giant pussy, you know
*  Not that he did that but just like these crick and the NBA is kind of turning into that or guys are just lobbing
*  like a munch jumper and had a whole thing the other day about how LeBron ruined basketball when he teamed up with Wade and
*  And Bosch and it was like didn't
*  Work you on LeBron's yeah
*  But these pods are just crazy and I do wonder if that's a sadded layer
*  I I actually think people compared to how this would have been received in the 1990s have been
*  Pretty reasonable about this and be thing with some of the stuff
*  He said I we've talked about a lot on this pod. There's been so many red flags
*  I thought the Olympics was a red flag that no back-to-back was a red flag, but
*  CR feels like something has shifted now at the city and imbede
*  Where it went from like you are a favorite son?
*  We would defend you and feel he's like this in a lot of ways where it's like you're our guy fuck everybody else
*  Yes, and that's what it is and it feels like that's been lost which I think is significant
*  Yeah, I would say it's probably I mean to the extent that I can tell from Los Angeles
*  I would say that the fanbase seems split 50-50 between like Joel
*  True believers. This is he's just hurt you guys aren't you know aren't being sympathetic to I'm over it
*  Okay, I can't take like you can't do it anymore
*  I can't take the the like I'm not gonna let myself feel anything because it's just gonna hurt his knee or get
*  Bell's palsy or whatever like the litany of things that have happened to him over the course of his career
*  and then you go back to the origin story of his whole thing where it's just like
*  it's kind of a
*  Little bit of a miracle that he's playing like when he was drafted
*  It was like if we ever get to see imbede
*  He could be the best player in this draft if we ever get to see him and we did and
*  He has never really really been a hundred percent
*  He's also had some really bad luck with injuries with you know running into faults or whatever and all that stuff
*  That was like not really like a muscle muscle damage thing
*  But to your point earlier about like the Patrick Ewing's of the world that just go downhill really fast like there's just too many knee injuries
*  Now I know there's
*  You know what else there is there's YouTube and you can go back and you can watch him
*  Six years ago seven years ago
*  And you can watch how he moves and watch him now and you almost doesn't look like the same guy
*  and that's that's the thing that is undeniable and that's
*  We have unlike 20 years ago where we didn't have the ability to just queue up
*  Whatever video we wanted now we can you can go back and you can watch him in Kansas in 2014 even you can watch him
*  In the sixers even during that regular season
*  Yeah, he just seemed like this fucking crazy unstoppable offensive force house the thing that's crazy to me
*  Is he's still able to get to 30 points like that's how skilled and and how well-crafted
*  Shot the lights out last night. Yeah, he's from from 15 to 18 feet
*  It's going in 98% of the time and he's figured out to do that and have enough of like going downhill lurching into people
*  He can still get his points, but I think the rebounding the defenses was falling apart what else have you seen?
*  Well, what I've seen is he shouldn't be on the basketball court. I would like him to take off
*  I think it would be good for him for the team for the franchise for him to just drop out
*  Come back after the new year get yourself right get yourself
*  Give yourself the best chance and you can after the new year
*  Play the games at at, you know NBA speed getting yourself back up into it
*  But really all of this dialogue is November dialogue. It doesn't matter
*  Right shit be ready in a mess
*  That's it unless it's so poisons where you might get to come April and you really the bar is so low
*  You just have to get to the play in it. It is the Eastern Conference
*  CR where does this go for you most disappointing Philly teams?
*  any sport
*  Extra extraordinarily high. Yeah, what was that Eagles team when you had awesome on all those guys? Yeah, that was dream team
*  Yeah, that was that sucked but it almost said that was like pride comes before the fall
*  Like there was just way too much hubris about that team. Yeah, and as soon as you start like this thing
*  Yeah, maybe you're right. I mean like that I did I thought that this team it was really wisely assembled
*  you know like it seemed like
*  Eric Gordon and Caleb Martin Drummond was in beads best backup that he's ever had
*  It just seemed like this was a very very expertly wisely assembled team. And so to have this be
*  Quite the opposite. Yeah. Yeah, and not only that but it would be one thing if they were just like physically not there to have it clearly
*  Be a culture problem within the locker room and a huge amount of distrust and a huge amount of like forget what the Philly fans
*  Think about indeed this was kind of repudiation of him from within the team
*  So whether it was like a towel guy who told somebody who told somebody who told Shams that article came out
*  Very soon after the meeting and it had quotes. So someone wanted to get a point across and embarrass him and it worked
*  there's somewhere to
*  That Celtic team which was such a disappointing team coming off the Eastern finals getting Hayward back
*  Year to Kyrie it seemed like he was getting a sign and it fell off from the get-go
*  but it had a couple similarities one was
*  The circus around Kyrie game to game which he's since then admitted
*  He's like, yeah, I was in a really rough spot in Boston that second year. You could feel it
*  There was like an emotional roller coaster that the players were on the team was on even the fans were on watching it
*  Like who what are we getting today? What version of him you have that?
*  But you also had people at different points of their career that were the wrong points for the team, right?
*  And Jalen Brown talked about that recently. He was on that team or Tatum talked about it
*  He wanted to prove that you know, he could do this and it's like now you're actually gonna be standing in the corner for a lot
*  Of these plays you're gonna be the number four guy. So the Sixers have a little of that too as you get older
*  You start seeing the signs of where it's not working. Whereas you look I don't know if the Lakers are gonna be good or not
*  but the way connect fit in just with what they needed and
*  I don't think that team's gonna be able to get stops
*  But reddick's got a D playing well and you can see like, okay
*  This makes sense and you know, you watched it from basketball teams like alright Houston. These guys make sense. There's an identity
*  Maybe it's not perfect. And then I watched Philly and I'm like, wow, I don't I don't know what this is
*  Yeah, it's also with that Lakers team
*  the thing that impresses me the most is just how they immediately came into the season with an identity and a sense of purpose where
*  you could have had the last few years of LeBron's career been at like a
*  Victory lap and it could just been a showcase and even the brawny thing in retrospect now
*  Like has become a footnote to this season where everybody's like this is gonna be such a huge distraction doesn't seem to matter
*  They handled it perfectly like reddick obviously commands that locker room to some extent
*  Incredible given the personalities and it's the exact opposite with the Sixers
*  They came to see what happens when they have a couple tough games that are sure
*  The Sixers came into the season unprepared, which I don't know. I don't know whose responsibility that is ultimately
*  Question but to be fair, how could they prepare? They couldn't have Joel and being in Paul George healthy
*  For the eventuality that these guys weren't gonna be ready and that they should just maybe
*  They should maybe tell the fan base tell the team
*  This is what the first six weeks of the season are gonna be like don't look at the record
*  You know tough though when you're you know when you're talking a championship from July on and victory lap in the whole summer
*  It's tough to just pivot that was why it was so it was so shocking when they did the back-to-back stuff house
*  What was your most disappointing team? I?
*  Mean other than the last 35 years of bullets was
*  Did you have a high expectations team that I can't pick one I?
*  Mean I honestly know like you know the Nationals it took them a little while
*  But they won the World Series in 2019 and it was a new franchise
*  You know here in 2005 so you know they oh that that that team with Jason Worth that should have been the one like not
*  Really the OV getting
*  You know over the the the penguins getting past Crosby
*  Finally like that that was going to be this real disappointing
*  You know career, but he got he got his one and we'll see what the story is with this knee injury
*  He may yet get Greskie's
*  Getting close. Yeah. Yeah. He's he is very close
*  How's this most disappointing team was the Wizards not being able to be Kelly a Linux in a game seven?
*  The one that keeps them up and say Washington
*  There was anything having to do the basketball team because they haven't won 50 games since 1978
*  There is no one most disappointing all the when you're in that kind of a streak
*  We had a couple really awful Red Sox teams that were super disappointing like there was like a Carl Everett season there was the chicken and beer
*  season
*  But you kind of you kind of know early when it's happening
*  And that's here with the Red Sox the last couple of seasons haven't you been like ever since Mookie your basic yeah
*  But you but I didn't have expectations. I think in this case
*  I was you know they were talking about the Sixers as a possible 60 win team and a two seed and all that stuff
*  I was thinking about the conversation you had with was and van last week. I think it was yeah
*  I
*  Think sometimes basketball moves on before
*  NBA fans are ready for it to happen
*  And I think that the sad truth here is that it just might this might not happen for this team or for at least for Embiid's
*  Version of this team and you just look around and I feel this way often
*  Once the NBA Finals comes around I'll watch
*  After the Sixers have been eliminated in the second round or the first round and I'll be like this is a different sport
*  like the Sixers are not close to this and
*  Now that he is very clearly on the downside of his career and in kind of like a physical decline
*  It's really hard to like look around and watch the way some of these other teams are playing and moving
*  And be like oh, yeah, I feel like this is this is a month-long break away from the Sixers. It's not it's not
*  It's like this is probably not gonna happen for this guy, and that's really sad
*  Well there was there was one play yesterday when Jaren Jackson fell down with his legs out and Embiid was dribbling toward him
*  And I was just like this is gonna be that you talked about the car crash at the beginning
*  I was like oh my god something horrible is about to happen and Embiid of course tripped over him, but he got up
*  But that's another piece of watching these games where there's three times a game where you feel like something
*  Horrible happened to him or maybe that was it or you know it just feels like he's carrying the weight on his world
*  It's it's both not that fun to watch and incredibly riveting to watch with the expectations that this team had
