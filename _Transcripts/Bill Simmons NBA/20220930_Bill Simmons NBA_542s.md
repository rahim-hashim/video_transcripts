# How Will LeBron End His Career? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w)
*  All right, Brian Winnhorst, I'm giving you four LeBron outcomes for the last stage of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=0.0s)]
*  LeBron. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=4.44s)]
*  Because I think we are entering now last stage of LeBron. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=5.44s)]
*  I agree. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=7.2s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=8.2s)]
*  Now somebody could watch Tom Brady's career and be like, well, wait, what was the, Tom [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Brady was telling us he was going to play till 45 when he was in like 2010. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=13.84s)]
*  I'm not surprised that he's still playing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=18.36s)]
*  LeBron has different wear and tear things against him in basketball, just like, and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=21.28s)]
*  he's now Neil Armstrong. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Once he gets to like 70,000 minutes and some of the stuff and 300 playoff games or whatever, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=28.04s)]
*  like these are just things. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=33.04s)]
*  I have no idea how to even calculate them, but here are the four options. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=34.04s)]
*  Number one, Laker for life. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=37.92s)]
*  Number two, Cleveland 3.0. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=40.36s)]
*  Number three, title chaser. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=43.64s)]
*  And number four, assuming his son can be good enough, which I think is a huge, huge variable [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=46.64s)]
*  that I don't want to count on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=52.56s)]
*  And I would say the odds are against it, not for it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  I just want to play with my son. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=57.36s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=58.64s)]
*  You name the team. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=59.64s)]
*  Which son? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=60.64s)]
*  That's the key. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=61.64s)]
*  Yeah, either son. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=62.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=63.64s)]
*  Hanging on for as long as possible to play with one of the sons. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=64.64s)]
*  I am going to make the case for title chaser. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=67.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  Because I think he can chase the title in a way that's not Mitch Richmond on the 2000 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=73.52s)]
*  Lakers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=79.88s)]
*  Like you think like even Carl Malone on the 04 Lakers who got hurt in the playoffs and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=80.88s)]
*  they were never the same, but he was a really valuable member of that team on and off the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=84.8s)]
*  court and was still pretty good. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=88.84s)]
*  And by the way, that team was good. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=90.88s)]
*  They weren't like 67 wins like people might have thought, but that team was very good. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=93.16s)]
*  That team beat the Spurs during the middle of the Duncan run. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=98.56s)]
*  That team was like a minus 500 favorite in the finals. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=103.24s)]
*  So it's not like that season was a failure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=106.84s)]
*  I'm looking at the odds with LeBron here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=111.6s)]
*  Just people still in the league. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=116.6s)]
*  So you go through the 04, 05, 06 drafts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  Igudalas 38, 04 draft, Carmelo 38, 03, Millsap who I don't even, is he even on a team this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  year? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  No, he's not on the league right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  So he's out. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Cross him off. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  Chris Paul's 37, 05. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Aldridge 37, 06. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't have a team right now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  Doesn't have a team. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Lowry and Gay are 06 draft, both 36. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=138.52s)]
*  And Dwight Howard 05 draft, 36. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=141.12s)]
*  Those are his quote unquote age range peers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=143.08s)]
*  And all of those guys, except for Chris Paul, are on their way out of the league. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=146.96s)]
*  And Chris Paul, I don't know how many more years he has. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=151.28s)]
*  So when you think of it that way, it's like, all right, not only would this be incredible [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=154.72s)]
*  just with NBA history, everyone from his quote unquote class is either gone or on their [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=158.44s)]
*  way out or they're Chris Paul. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=164.12s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  That's the entire list. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what to count on, which makes me wonder if title chaser, because he's got [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=168.0s)]
*  the four rings, he's two behind Jordan, he's one behind Kobe, he's one behind Duncan, he's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=172.28s)]
*  the same amount as Curry. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=177.16s)]
*  Is he going to be happy just having the four rings if he's thinking about how do I put [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  together my argument that I'm the goat, I'm the best player of all time? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't think the four rings is going to be enough. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=186.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I will say that last year as a 36 turning 37 year old, he had his second highest scoring [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  average in his career. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=195.28s)]
*  The game is played differently than early on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, why some of the old LeBron games that you can watch on NBA TV, it's rough. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=199.72s)]
*  It's I mean, he's great, but it's rough basketball. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=207.32s)]
*  It's rough. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  Basketball, the league's way worse. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  It just was. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=211.88s)]
*  That's a reality. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=212.92s)]
*  Go through the NBA teams that we just didn't have the same level of talent. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=214.6s)]
*  We did. I mean, if I was just at the Timberwolves first practice today and I was watching [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=218.16s)]
*  out there and Carl Towns isn't even here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=224.72s)]
*  He's under the weather. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=226.32s)]
*  But I'm look I'm looking at this team and I'm like. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=228.8s)]
*  There'd be years where this team would be number two seed in the West, like there'd [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=233.28s)]
*  be 30 media outlets here because this team would be loaded. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=239.68s)]
*  Like think of some of the teams that KG was on that would have loved to have. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=246.36s)]
*  Like this is a team that like might play great this year and finish fifth or sixth in the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=247.36s)]
*  West. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=251.88s)]
*  And like it might not be a bad year. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=252.68s)]
*  Literally, they could finish seventh and I wouldn't be shocked. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=254.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=257.6s)]
*  So OK, so here's the thing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=257.92s)]
*  Wait, flip that around with LeBron in 2018. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=259.72s)]
*  Look at the team he was on in 2018 and put that team in the West with like a peak LeBron. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=262.64s)]
*  I think that team's probably not a top five seed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=269.72s)]
*  The league's just better. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=271.92s)]
*  Anyway, I interrupted you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=272.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, that's the thing, Bill. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=273.96s)]
*  Like some of the years that LeBron got through the East with the Cavs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=275.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=281.0s)]
*  Those teams would have. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, forget about it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  Forget about getting on the second round with some of those teams. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=286.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=290.08s)]
*  Even with LeBron at that power with where the East is right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, so here's the thing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=294.76s)]
*  I have a hard time seeing him. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=296.84s)]
*  Not being a Laker or a Cavs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  So if you're going to say title, sir. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=303.64s)]
*  It's the Cavs. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=307.0s)]
*  Is it got to be? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=308.11999999999995s)]
*  He's kind of kind of wrapped with Cleveland 3.0. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=312.67999999999995s)]
*  So that's so I should have. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=313.32s)]
*  That should have been my fifth option. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=314.64s)]
*  Cleveland 3.0 and title chase. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=315.96s)]
*  That's like the hybrid model. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=319.55999999999995s)]
*  Because I don't think any. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=320.52s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  In this world where we're in right now, I think on one hand, I think. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=323.28s)]
*  These players get so much crap for like the quality of their titles. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=329.84s)]
*  Like, yeah, it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=334.64s)]
*  I know they're just trying to get under Durant's skin [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  because he can have his skin gotten under. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=340.88s)]
*  He's made it clear that you can get to him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand why he does that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=345.88s)]
*  But like the people who get on Durant. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=347.68s)]
*  For quote unquote, not having a legit title. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=352.52s)]
*  Is so annoying to me. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=358.52s)]
*  And it's now gotten worse because the Warriors won one without him [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=361.56s)]
*  with mostly the same core. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  And I just think that, like, if LeBron goes, like in signs with Memphis [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=367.68s)]
*  to, like, support John Morant in three years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=374.44s)]
*  I just think that that is a look that he's not going to want. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=378.8s)]
*  So Cleveland has four dudes in their early to mid 20s. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=382.2s)]
*  Who are pretty good. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=387.6s)]
*  I don't think they're a title team right now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=388.56s)]
*  But like. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=391.92s)]
*  I could see them when Evan Mobley, like, is in his fourth or fifth year. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=393.44s)]
*  You know, those guys are now like 27, 28, 29, instead of 22, 23, 24. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=399.56s)]
*  And LeBron could come in and play a role. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  I could see that, by the way, like, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=409.12s)]
*  I could say next year, the Cavs are in horrible need of a three. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, look, they need to have. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=418.88s)]
*  But they need a three that can defend to, which is at this point in his career. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=421.76s)]
*  But like next year, you could see him in that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=426.08s)]
*  Kind of whatever role Kevin Love is in this year, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=429.04s)]
*  a fancy version of that, that he could be like their backup point guard. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=432.64s)]
*  And he could also play the four and multi. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=437.0s)]
*  And he's like a Swiss Army knife all over the place. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  I think Cleveland's very realistic and I'm higher on them than you are. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=441.76s)]
*  I think Mobley's special. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=444.68s)]
*  And I think he is, too. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=446.64s)]
*  But I don't know what Mobley's going to be next year for him, though. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=447.8s)]
*  You said year four, year five. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=450.8s)]
*  Next year might be when he starts to become an impact guy, especially defensively. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=452.68s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm sure I guarantee LeBron has been watching that and the Mitchell trade. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=456.52s)]
*  He was, you know, same thing like when you remember 2014, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=462.36s)]
*  when when Cleveland won the lottery. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=466.48s)]
*  Or 2013 when Cleveland won the lottery. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=469.56s)]
*  And it was kind of the first time like, oh, well, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=474.4s)]
*  first off, LeBron was like complementing the Cavs during that run. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=478.48s)]
*  Yeah, that was just there were little breadcrumbs being sprinkled. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  He was like praising like Deion Waiters, who he got rid of in about 15 minutes. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  But he was like, yeah, they got something going. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=490.12s)]
*  And I remember the night the Cavs won that last lottery, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=492.68s)]
*  the lottery that got them the Wiggins pick. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=497.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, 2014. Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=500.92s)]
*  It was Heat, Pacers, Eastern Conference Finals. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=503.68s)]
*  And I remember being in the Heat locker room. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=507.23999999999995s)]
*  After the game and hearing LeBron talk about the Cavs winning the lottery, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=510.32s)]
*  you know, not like in a sinister way, but like noting it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  I think I got in trouble on TV that night because I said something [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=521.68s)]
*  like LeBron was off that game and I was like, I think LeBron was thrown [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=524.72s)]
*  that the Cavs won the lottery. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=527.8s)]
*  But fuck you. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDW_hMht-w&t=529.16s)]
