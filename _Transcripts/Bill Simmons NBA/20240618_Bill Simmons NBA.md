# Celtics Are Champs, Jaylen Wins MVP and the Road to #18 with Bill's Dad! | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD_qsjtcFuA)
*  All right. I'm here with my dad. It is 11 44 Eastern time. What happened tonight?
*  You know, I'm still nervous. Did we actually win that game?
*  The game's over, right?
*  The game's over, right? It's over. We didn't give up that 18 20 point lead, right?
*  16 years ago, same day, June 17th, 2008.
*  We were there.
*  We were there and the Celtics you knew within probably the midway mark of the second quarter was like, they're definitely winning.
*  And then the Lakers, you could see that. So throw up by like 40.
*  The whole second half was a party. Never doubt we're going to win this time around.
*  We're 21 with three minutes left and you and I are like, we got to stop blue.
*  This time out, he might hit seven threes.
*  Even when we were up by 21 at halftime, I had still had trouble getting Friday night's game out of my head.
*  I know. And what an anomaly that whole game turns out to be.
*  We were terrific tonight and I thought Tatum played the game of the year.
*  Yeah, that was the most proud I've been of Tatum after a basketball game, including the 50 point Philly game, including game six Milwaukee.
*  This was such a great. We're going to talk about him later.
*  I mean, the big thing.
*  Pritchard hits that three.
*  Oh, hitting into halftime. He comes in with four seconds left.
*  I think Lucas shooting free throws.
*  I think it was like three and a half seconds.
*  And it was going to be 64 46 at halftime.
*  Right.
*  Pritchard comes in.
*  He hasn't played the whole first half.
*  He comes in, everyone in the crowd, everyone who's ever watched the Celtics team this season knows what's going to happen.
*  They're running some sort of Pritchard play.
*  Dallas knows it.
*  The Celtics know it.
*  And Pritchard get makes the half court shot.
*  And that was Bird steals the ball loud.
*  And that was the first time I really was like, I think we're going to.
*  I think it might have been louder than Bird steals the ball because this is game seven of the finals.
*  No, it wasn't.
*  That wasn't that wasn't the finals against Detroit.
*  That series that was nothing was louder than that.
*  We thought the balcony was going to collapse.
*  I thought this was pretty loud.
*  This is pretty loud.
*  It was definitely the loudest.
*  You've been in more games than me in this building.
*  That was the loudest I've ever heard.
*  Let's say the loudest since Bird stole the ball and fed Dennis Johnson.
*  What would have been a louder moment in the new building?
*  So last 20 years, nothing.
*  I can't think of anything.
*  Nothing.
*  Because like you said, the 2008 game six was not a close game.
*  No.
*  So there was never that opportunity for the crowd to roar.
*  That was a roar in that crowd.
*  Yeah, because people knew it was going to happen.
*  He was going to take a crazy shot.
*  He pulled up even 12 feet further away than I was expecting.
*  Nails it.
*  And the whole Celtic bench ran to him like it was a game.
*  It was halftime.
*  It wasn't even off the backboard.
*  That was swish.
*  18 titles for the Boston Celtics that we miscounted.
*  You've been a season ticket holder for 51 years for so long that we thought it was your 10th title.
*  This is actually your 11th.
*  My 11th final.
*  7th title.
*  7 and 4.
*  I think that's a pretty good record.
*  And that was we were in the house when they won in 84 and in 86 and in 08 and this one.
*  4.
*  This was a team that we were with for a long time with Tatum and Brown.
*  And I think the difference between this and 08 where we had pierced that whole time.
*  But really that was it.
*  Everybody else kind of showed up.
*  They showed up.
*  Hired guns.
*  This time the Tatum Brown we've been with.
*  You've been watching those guys since they were 19.
*  Right.
*  Although again, poor Zingas, White, Drew Holiday, they did come on board from elsewhere.
*  And Big Al who was here for a while left came back.
*  So he's kind of the third longest.
*  You know, everybody looked so happy on the stage.
*  Nobody looked happier than Al Horford.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean the best part because we've been fortunate enough to have been to a couple of these.
*  The best part is when the starters start coming out one after the other.
*  Which is if you win a title and it's a close game, you don't have that.
*  And this one it was like, OK, the Dallas Waved Away flag under three minutes left.
*  So he took Horford out and Horford just walked over the scores table and he just looked at the whole section.
*  Had his hands up.
*  And that guy's never won a title before.
*  So that was great.
*  Tatum and Brown came out together.
*  Right.
*  And then Drew and Derek came out together.
*  It was a nice way to do it.
*  Poor Zingas had come out earlier.
*  I guess maybe the second happiest person.
*  Everybody was happy.
*  But poor Zingas turning when they're on the stage, turning to the crowd, waving to people in the crowd.
*  Guy was so happy.
*  I don't know if there's ever been a home Celtic player like him that engaged with the crowd.
*  Almost like watching when you're at like a fifth grade play and one of the kids is like waving to his parents.
*  And his mind is he must be saying, last year I was in Washington.
*  Right.
*  Now I'm here.
*  I don't feel like he's probably ever really truly been appreciated on a good team.
*  Because even when he was on the Knicks, those teams were bad.
*  Fans love him.
*  He was in Dallas.
*  Fans love him.
*  And then before the game and the teams out, they're shooting and shoot around.
*  And then poor Zingas, because he's doing whatever, his treadmill thing, whatever he does.
*  There's two doctors out there trying to decide if it's OK from the play.
*  Right.
*  So he came in late and he walks in, the crowd goes nuts.
*  And then he just turns and he's just like waving.
*  He's like, say hey guys, I'm here.
*  Kid in the candy store.
*  And statistically it wasn't a great game, but he made a difference.
*  He made a difference in second half.
*  There was a stretch in the first half.
*  He was a little rusty.
*  Yeah.
*  He came in and Josh Green had two threes and somebody else had a three and he gave up a layup in Dallas.
*  And she's like, we're attacking this guy because you could tell he couldn't totally move.
*  And he was rusty.
*  Yeah.
*  He couldn't move laterally the same way.
*  But second half, he seemed to loosen up and I thought he played a lot, but he had a couple of blocks right at the rim.
*  It definitely was a difference than game four where you had those Tillman minutes.
*  Tillman didn't play tonight because it was just a bad match.
*  I mean, some of the stuff that was sitting there in game three, game four, like how impactful Lively was wasn't impactful.
*  But we kept looking up at the stats the whole night.
*  The Seltzer were significantly out rebounding Dallas.
*  And when you think about the Friday night game where we got killed on the boards, this is totally different.
*  Fifty one thirty five rebounds, fifteen offensive.
*  The guards were getting holiday had four offensive rebounds.
*  Derek White had four offensive rebounds.
*  Derek White had his block.
*  That was my favorite bet of the day.
*  Celtics to win with a white block was like even odds on Fandel.
*  So they fixed a lot of the stuff, the issues they're having in game four.
*  And then the other thing is I thought in the first half, they really were like, we're not we're not letting Luke have twenty five points in the first half.
*  They were picking them up full court.
*  Jalen and we'll talk about the finals MVP later.
*  But one of the great things he did in this game, he didn't shoot well, but he was full court.
*  But he was full court with Luca really trying to make him work a little bit.
*  So they had to go to the side guys.
*  Green had a couple threes like.
*  But it just wasn't the same.
*  And Kyrie sucked.
*  It was another another stinker for him in Boston.
*  A stinker and a couple of hero attempt three pointers that didn't go in.
*  And he has five for 16.
*  You know, Green hit those three three point shots.
*  They made a difference a little bit.
*  But I just thought Porzingis was a little bit out of sync in the first half in terms of where he should be defensively.
*  And they kind of cleaned it up in the second half.
*  Yeah, it's interesting. He played 60 minutes.
*  Five points, one rebound.
*  They didn't credit him with a block, but he's plus eight.
*  I guess maybe didn't touch the ball, but he changed the big that big dunk off the brown pass for the L.U.
*  It started to feel like in the second half.
*  But I thought when you think like he came in and they immediately went on like an eight, nothing run.
*  But then it was plus eight for the game.
*  So he was a little impactful.
*  Let's talk the Tatum game.
*  Tatum was 45 minutes tonight.
*  Thirty one.
*  I don't even remember him going coming out of the game.
*  So he did come out for three minutes.
*  I think he came out in the first half.
*  Thirty one, eleven assists, eight rebounds.
*  He had nine assists in the first half.
*  And two big boy drives in the fourth quarter when Dallas Luca was doing the Michael Myers thing.
*  He just chop his head off basically to get rid of him.
*  He's pretty scary.
*  I'm going to have nightmares him all summer.
*  He's scary.
*  He wins by I mean, just a turn of respect.
*  It's like two years ago with Yanis in the Milwaukee series when we beat Milwaukee and we were like, we're going to use we this whole puck.
*  He just got no help.
*  I mean, on the road, nothing.
*  You know, I mean, they made some threes and a couple of corner threes, like we said.
*  But it was all Luca.
*  And I thought Brown did a tremendous job on him despite the fact that Luca scored.
*  I mean, he made him work by about five minutes left in the fourth quarter.
*  Luca could barely get up and down the court.
*  He was he was gone.
*  Yeah, I thought both sides seemed really tired in the fourth quarter.
*  That thing.
*  And we've been a few of these big games over the years.
*  The energy of games like that in the games just feel longer than they actually are.
*  And you keep looking up.
*  That was one of those games reminded me of Game 7 0 4 Yankees Red Sox when it was like we're up nine to two.
*  We need nine outs.
*  And then you're just looking at it like now we need eight out.
*  And it just felt like it was going up for seven hours.
*  And here I'm watching the clock.
*  Yeah, I remember looking up and it's not moving fast enough.
*  I looked up at one point and it felt like the Mavs were starting to get ideas.
*  And there was like four minutes left in the third quarter.
*  It's like, oh, my God, I feel like we've been here for five hours.
*  You know, it's so significant, though, to have that 21 point lead at halftime.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I guess we shouldn't have been so nervous.
*  It would have been awfully hard for Dallas to come back.
*  But that's the thing about this team.
*  It basically tonight and we got to talk about Tatum because now I forgot to do it twice.
*  But this team all year felt like they were up 20, 75 percent of the season.
*  And you and you rose like, I wonder if they're going to finish this.
*  I wonder if the other team's going to get it was just weird because I think when you're tied to threes and the offense would slow down sometimes.
*  And the crowd was weird.
*  The crowd was excited but nervous in the fourth quarter.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, which I think was probably mostly look, I mean, you and I said before the game started, this crowd is nervous.
*  You could just feel the nervous tension in the crowd to begin the game before the game.
*  I mean, I got there almost an hour earlier.
*  It wasn't the loud crowding as we had in games one and two.
*  This was a nervous crowd.
*  You didn't want to go with me to the game because you were like, I don't I'm going to show up before the game because I'm nervous.
*  I don't want to be around anybody.
*  And then you showed up with like 45 minutes for the game, just throwing popcorn down like a champ sitting in my seat.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I wanted to watch some of the plays warm up.
*  You know, and it's interesting, Pritchett probably tried that shot three or four times because he's the only guy left out there before the game.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's a shot.
*  That's the crazy, crazy, crazy half crutch shot.
*  Yeah. It's funny.
*  So we had an 84 in person.
*  That was just a bloodbath of a series and a really, really great, exciting game seven.
*  But, you know, those teams are really even.
*  Eighty six.
*  There was just no question we were beating Houston.
*  Like the Sampson punches, Siege thing in game five.
*  It's like we're definitely 100% beating these guys.
*  Oh, wait.
*  Felt the same way.
*  Felt like we should have finished it in five in L.A.
*  Felt like we were better than laid the smack down.
*  This game, because of how bad they looked in game four.
*  Right.
*  There was a weird energy.
*  There was like walking around.
*  There's a lot of people like, what do you think tonight, Bill?
*  Nobody was like, we're going to do it tonight, Bill.
*  Yeah.
*  When I came in and the guy said to me, you know, we're down by 48 points on Friday.
*  What do you think?
*  You know, that didn't help my nervousness.
*  Well, and then I talked to a bunch of like people who weren't rooting for either side, like NBA people.
*  People who are working for different media and all of them are just like, you don't want to go back to Dallas on Thursday.
*  And I'm like, I'm aware.
*  Positive.
*  I don't want to go back to Dallas.
*  Right.
*  But it was one of those things, the things we were looking at were.
*  I remember texting this to one of my Celtics threads.
*  Rebounding.
*  Rebounding.
*  Can we take care of that?
*  Rebounding for me was the key.
*  Drew Halliday revenge game for how bad he was in game four.
*  The first half, the first half, he did good stuff on Kyrie defensively and made a couple of shots around the basket.
*  So that was a plus.
*  He missed three little bunnies.
*  He doesn't usually miss those.
*  But he made a couple in the first half.
*  The threes were watching.
*  They were 12 for 23 at one point.
*  And then they missed eight in a row.
*  Yeah, they missed eight in a row.
*  But the threes were good.
*  And then the big thing was Tatum.
*  He was like an orchestra leader out there, wasn't he?
*  It was all the best parts of Tatum.
*  And, you know, at the end of the first quarter, he had to do the quarters winding down.
*  I'm going to take my step back three.
*  And he missed it.
*  Right.
*  And then in the second quarter, same thing, he made it.
*  And then the Mavs came back down.
*  Luka had the free throws and then the Pritchard three.
*  So there was like a flurry of action, but he actually made the step back at the end of the quarter.
*  I was like, oh, he's feeling it tonight.
*  He did make it.
*  And then, as you said, Dantrik had the free throws, but he missed the second one.
*  The second one bounced, got the rebound.
*  And they weren't ready.
*  And they weren't ready when Pritchard had the ball, bringing the ball up the court.
*  They cut Pritchard's man.
*  Pritchard got cut out.
*  Thurmond was cut out.
*  Porzingis played.
*  They basically went seven.
*  Hauser was big.
*  Hauser had a couple of huge shots in the first half.
*  And then in the second half, he missed like two threes that would have just basically ended the game.
*  They rolled around.
*  Both threes rolled around the room.
*  But Dallas, I felt like Dallas was just searching.
*  Kid was still, it's game five.
*  And he's like, ah, Exum, Gafford.
*  And he just, he was playing roulette with all his role players and he didn't, he couldn't find five guys.
*  No, he was hoping one of the role plays would get hot.
*  It never happened.
*  Yeah, because Hench texted me that my friend Kevin Hench, that the Mavs averaged 93.5 points in the four losses,
*  which in the modern NBA is basically a catastrophe.
*  And that's a high scoring team.
*  Yeah.
*  So they took away the threes.
*  They took away the role players and they kind of held on for dear life.
*  We took away Lively in this game and Lively was terrific in a couple of the other games.
*  Yeah, he was never good in a road game though.
*  It was interesting.
*  It was the home games.
*  And that's the thing.
*  It's my home court advantage matters sometimes, especially with young players and the role players.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  So my dad, we talked about it after game one that if Joe Missoula led the Celtics to an NBA championship,
*  my dad was going to officially promote him from second row Joe to first row Joe.
*  I was for the record, I was all in on first row Joe after game one.
*  I thought he coached a really good game tonight.
*  What was interesting is he extricated himself from a couple of bad decisions.
*  Like they went small ball in the second quarter at one point and it just or the third quarter and just it just didn't work.
*  They took Corford out.
*  They didn't have Perzingis out.
*  They played tandem and then Gaffer got two dunks.
*  Somebody else got a layup at the rim and he just immediately got out of it.
*  A couple other good timeouts too, which he just didn't do last year.
*  But that example of small ball is a great example of maybe Missoula's growth because you're right.
*  It was a bad move.
*  Dallas immediately scored, I think, eight points.
*  He called a timeout and we never saw a small ball again.
*  No.
*  You will never hear me say second row Joe again.
*  Oh, I thought he did a great job.
*  I thought he coached a great game tonight.
*  I guess, you know, we're 16 and three in the playoffs.
*  Right.
*  We had a sweep and three five game series.
*  80 and 21 for the season.
*  It's going to go down as statistically one of the best teams ever.
*  A little like the 2015 Warriors.
*  I mentioned this the other day on the pod.
*  People didn't really know what to think the whole time.
*  And so I'm not going to even call him first row Joe.
*  He's coach Missoula now.
*  Oh, this is really my like welling up.
*  Jesus didn't realize this was the end of terms of a gear.
*  Yeah.
*  Unbelievable.
*  We won a championship.
*  He's coach Joe.
*  He's coach Missoula coach show Missoula or coach Missoula.
*  The team, I got to say, and I spent a lot of time with Boston people when I was in
*  Dallas and I just heard the same thing over and over again.
*  The players love him.
*  The players respect him.
*  He's really earned the admiration of everybody around him.
*  And I can't remember.
*  Obviously, we're hard on coaches and managers because that's what we do.
*  That's what we do.
*  We just like complain.
*  They know way more than we do.
*  We don't care.
*  We complain about them.
*  I can't remember.
*  We've been the first season.
*  I remember anything was like the 74 Bruins and Celtics and just all the way through.
*  I can't remember a coach or manager that we felt like this guy just doesn't just doesn't
*  have it who then did a 180.
*  Can you certainly didn't happen the Red Sox?
*  No, I can't remember.
*  I mean, Patriots, Heinzen, I always felt knew what he was doing.
*  Bill Fitch knew what he was doing, but he wore it as welcome.
*  Casey Jones was a great with the players.
*  I'm not sure he was a great technician, but he kind of killed us in 87.
*  Well, he really killed us in 88.
*  He didn't play Reggie Lewis.
*  Never.
*  I'll never get over that.
*  Yeah.
*  My death better would be like the 11 thing.
*  I think I think why didn't he play Reggie Lewis in the 80s?
*  The first thing I'll think of my death bed is Magic's hook shot in 85.
*  87.
*  Oh, 87.
*  No, I'm saying there's Bruins coaches.
*  I can't think of another example of this, but you know, we weren't we were kind of out
*  on Joe, but not all the way out because he was put in such a bad position last year that
*  that was the hope.
*  It's like, you know what?
*  Nobody was ever in a worse coaching spot with that with a team built to win the title.
*  EMA gets bounced right before the season.
*  The we lost Will Hardy from the season before to who's the number one.
*  So now we're down the top two coaches.
*  He's got Damon Stoudamire leaves during the season and it just felt like we would look
*  at the assistants on the bench and we were like, who are these guys?
*  Well, not only that, but they're all has been hired by the previous coach.
*  Right.
*  It wasn't Missoula's staff.
*  And, you know, the end of the season last season, they all left for the most part to
*  go to Houston.
*  Yeah.
*  And Missoula and Brad Stevens got the higher new assistant coaches and they were terrific.
*  And I thought they really helped Joe Missoula mature as a coach this year.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't put that aside.
*  But some of the stuff we complained about with him last year, he just stopped doing
*  the stubbornness about I'm never calling a timeout.
*  The guys have to play their way out of it.
*  And it was like no other coach does this show.
*  You can't you have to.
*  And he did.
*  He called even today.
*  He called a couple of momentum stoppers.
*  But I would say that the assistant coaches and Brad Stevens helped him learn those nuances
*  of the game.
*  And then the other thing, he was just so committed to the threes.
*  And it's not something we certainly that I certainly grew up with.
*  And you've spanned all eras of hoops.
*  But it just seemed like, can you really win just jacking threes?
*  How many did we jack up that tonight?
*  Because we also went inside a lot.
*  Really did 13 for 39 from three.
*  So we were 33 percent.
*  But we were 12 for 23.
*  So they were one for the last six.
*  And that's what started to make us nervous.
*  Yeah.
*  When they missed eight in a row and stopped going inside, inside out or outside in.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm looking at the play sheet and it's just a lot of a lot of misses at the top of the
*  key, actually.
*  It feels like we missed like all the top of the.
*  Well, most of those might have been Jalen Brown.
*  Did he make any threes?
*  Yeah, it wasn't.
*  So Jalen finished.
*  Seven for 23.
*  Eight rebounds, six assists, five for six, and he was two for nine from three.
*  Two for nine.
*  So we both and I don't really care.
*  And what sucks about this is that once again, that this is now a Tatum Brown conversation
*  because this is what the national media will do coming out of the finals, probably the
*  way today.
*  And then it's like, who's the best part in this team?
*  Is Jason Tatum going to like the fact that he didn't?
*  Is this going to split the team up?
*  I think those guys are super tight.
*  I thought it was close.
*  I thought Tatum's game tonight, combined with all the other stuff he did in the playoffs,
*  like the first half he played in Game 3, which he was exceptional, didn't have a good second
*  half.
*  The second half was better.
*  The second half was better.
*  All the stuff he was doing with Dallas' defense, they were geared toward Tatum specifically,
*  I thought, for a lot of it.
*  I just thought he should have won.
*  But I'm also fine with Jalen and I'm happy for that dude too.
*  After Game 4, when we talked, excuse me, after Game 2 at home and then Game 3 on the road,
*  we talked and we both thought Jalen was heading toward the MVP.
*  But tonight, after that horrendous game on Friday, for Tatum to lead the team like he
*  did tonight and play the kind of game he played tonight, and again, it was like the person
*  leading the orchestra all night long, I might have leaned Tatum's way.
*  You know what?
*  Now that I'm looking at it.
*  So Tatum was 12 for 38 in the first two games.
*  And for the series, he averaged 22, 8, and 7.
*  And then Jalen averaged 21, 5, and 5.
*  That's pretty tight.
*  So really close.
*  Could have gone either way.
*  Could have gone either way.
*  It was one of those where it's like, can we just have them split it?
*  Can we just have a split vote?
*  I'm good with it as long as Tatum's good with it.
*  You know?
*  I haven't really wavered with this because this happened, I remember, in 07 with Tim Duncan
*  where Tim Duncan was the winningest player in the league in the 2000s and was the best
*  part in the Spurs by far.
*  And they sweep a terrible Cavs team and Parker played really well.
*  It's like our finals MVP is Tony Parker.
*  And it's like, this is why in my book I did a whole playoffs MVP because I was like, cool,
*  you have the MVP for a series, but we should also have a postseason MVP.
*  And I think Tatum was the postseason MVP, right?
*  Or would you say Jalen?
*  No, I'd say Tatum.
*  But ironically or interestingly, Brown got both of the MVPs.
*  Yeah, maybe you're right.
*  I really hope this doesn't start shit.
*  Who votes on the MVP?
*  I was mad.
*  I blame Tim Frank, whose son listens to this podcast.
*  And Tim Frank didn't give me a vote because he said I didn't cover enough games.
*  Yeah, I didn't get it.
*  OK.
*  Sorry.
*  So you might have made a difference.
*  I think I would have voted for Tatum because I thought he was so spectacular tonight that I feel like that that would have swung it for me.
*  Well, that was my thinking that after that debacle on Friday, for Tatum to play the kind of game he did tonight, it was so meaningful.
*  And I didn't think Brown had a good game tonight.
*  I mean, he didn't shoot well.
*  He didn't have a good offensive game.
*  He did have a good defense.
*  He played really, really hard.
*  Yeah, I thought he did some good stuff on Luca.
*  I mean, so it's 98-75.
*  And I'm still nervous.
*  98-75.
*  Well, I was writing down notes.
*  98-75, 6-31 left.
*  That was when Tatum had a three point play and a two.
*  And was just kind of nobody else could make a shot anymore.
*  And the offense got stagnant and he was kind of just carrying it.
*  But did you know the first three minutes of the fourth quarter, we scored the only two points.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, it was 86-67.
*  Nobody could score.
*  Yeah, forever.
*  But then Tatum then had those two fantastic drives in a row to make it 102-78 with 4-39 left.
*  But those were like, I just don't think he would have done that two years ago.
*  I think he would have done step backs.
*  Those were bully ball drives to the basket.
*  He wasn't going to be stopped.
*  And this is the thing with him.
*  And I keep saying this.
*  Rossello and I always argued on my part.
*  I just feel like he's so not a finished product yet.
*  I think he's going to be stronger.
*  I think he's going to have a post game.
*  Well, I think you win a championship.
*  Now the narrative is they're world champions.
*  They're going to come back differently, I think.
*  They're going to come back.
*  They'll work hard in the game, I hope, this summer.
*  And they'll have so much more confidence as a world champion.
*  Well, can I say selfishly?
*  I think it's a good thing that Tatum didn't win the finals MVP.
*  Because now it's like a little carrot.
*  Yeah, now he's like, OK.
*  Even though we won a title, I'm not the finals MVP.
*  Bird didn't win in 1981.
*  And it was an interesting one because Maxwell was really good in that series.
*  Yeah, he was really good.
*  But Bird was the best player on the team.
*  I don't know.
*  It's a weird one because if you're just voting for the series only,
*  and you're kind of ignoring who the actual best player on the team is.
*  I hope it doesn't become an issue.
*  You know the local Boston shows tomorrow.
*  You know they're going to have a...
*  They'll be like the second segment they do.
*  Could this be it for Tatum and Brown?
*  Those guys, I was watching...
*  First of all, Tatum, I think if I had to rank the happiest guys coming off,
*  I think he was out of the five starters.
*  I thought he was going to start bawling.
*  He was so happy.
*  He was hugging everybody.
*  He lifted Mazola off the ground.
*  He was so happy.
*  Yeah.
*  And then just in general, like first, I mean we got to go through some of the dudes.
*  Derek White, who it seems like is looming now for Team USA
*  because I had heard that before.
*  I had heard that before too.
*  If Kawhi doesn't play.
*  He had a couple of key three-point shots when Dallas was making those mini runs they make with Luca.
*  Yeah, terrific season.
*  Yeah, wait.
*  And we better extend that contract.
*  Yeah, I don't think that's a question.
*  And then Drew Holiday now.
*  Four more years.
*  I think with the way the barrier for the Hall of Fame has dropped, like Michael Cooper made it,
*  Drew's probably a Hall of Famer now.
*  Two titles for two different teams.
*  He was the third best player on the Bucs.
*  And also the way he changed his game to play for this team.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, his game with Milwaukee was completely different.
*  I mean, he was a second option scoring.
*  Yeah, and had the ball a lot.
*  Had the ball a lot.
*  This team, that wasn't the case.
*  There was a selflessness with this team that I think was my favorite thing about it.
*  I didn't always love the style of what they played,
*  but I really feel like about every single player sacrificed something, right?
*  Tatum, I think Tatum, if he wanted, could be a 30 plus point a game scorer.
*  If he was just jacking up shots, Carmelo, late 2007.
*  He did have that season over 30, didn't he?
*  Or close, yeah.
*  And I think Jalen could be in the high 20s.
*  Drew could certainly score more.
*  Poor Zingas on a different team could have been like a 25 points a game guy.
*  My favorite part about this team is we sit near the bench.
*  Yeah.
*  And watching the closeness of the teammates, the camaraderie, it's so apparent.
*  You don't see it on other teams.
*  We certainly haven't seen it on certain Celtics teams.
*  No, oh no.
*  Yeah, there was when Hauser came in, he had his first three.
*  And Brissette was standing next to Missoula.
*  And Brissette, who I thought could have played more in this whole playoffs
*  and was probably the biggest perplexing thing for, like, we just like,
*  why don't that guy has energy and he rebounds and he tries hard,
*  why doesn't he play more?
*  But he was always locked in as a bench guy.
*  Right.
*  And Hauser was shooting that three and Brissette was next to him.
*  You could probably watch on the clip.
*  He's just jumping up and down like he's like a cheerleader.
*  The chemistry in this team was unbelievable.
*  Unbelievable.
*  And what's your phrase about when a team wins,
*  how hard it is to keep that camaraderie the second time?
*  The secret.
*  Well, it's the disease of more.
*  Yeah, the disease of more.
*  This team will not have the disease of more.
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Jason Tatum is going to get a $350 million extension probably tomorrow.
*  And poor Zengis has been paid.
*  Drew has been paid.
*  Derek White has been paid.
*  Well, Derek White needs to get the extension.
*  Well, but he's going to get paid.
*  They're giving it to him.
*  And then.
*  I will say this, that Wick, who you could see, he had the cigar out.
*  He had the cigar out with two minutes to go.
*  He's a freaking character.
*  Just eating it up.
*  He was so happy.
*  And then he was, I think his original production company is called Banner 17.
*  Or his company was LLC.
*  Then it became, I don't know what it is now, but that was 16 years.
*  It was a long time, man.
*  When they won the 2008 title, my son was eight months old.
*  And now he's a summer internship and he's driving.
*  We also thought in 08 that we were going to win the next two titles.
*  I mean, we had the same team.
*  We had some bad health issues.
*  I mean, couldn't you, wouldn't you think about that in this run where it's like.
*  Yeah. I don't know if Porzingis is going to ever be healthy for an entire season again.
*  You know, Drew's in his mid thirties now.
*  We had really good health luck this year, except for Porzingis.
*  You know, that could go sideways.
*  Should we just save Porzingis for the playoffs?
*  Is that possible?
*  Could you pay somebody $30 million a year?
*  Just to play 16 games.
*  I mean, that's kind of what they did in this playoffs.
*  Yeah, but I mean, it wasn't planned that way.
*  You know, we only lost four regular season games at home.
*  Is that true?
*  Yeah. That's my memory anyway.
*  I don't think that's true.
*  I like that you think that though.
*  No, let's see. Oh yeah.
*  37 and four at home regular season, but then they lost on Miami.
*  Well, I said regular season.
*  Oh yeah.
*  37 and four.
*  And then in the playoffs, we lost two games.
*  But only the one to Miami at home.
*  So they went.
*  No, we lost game two against Cleveland at home too.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  So six losses. That's pretty good.
*  Pretty good.
*  When did you think this team could win the title?
*  I always thought this team could win the title.
*  Do you want me to go through all my texts?
*  I don't remember texting anything like that.
*  I thought the addition of Porzingis and Holliday just made this team so different in terms of the approach.
*  My concern was we're so three point happy.
*  I mean, that's always been my concern throughout the season, but I thought this was possibly a championship team.
*  Mike, the other thing that I did bring up to you repeatedly was I don't know if we could beat Denver.
*  And neither one of us wanted to go near Denver and we never had to go near Denver.
*  So that was fortuitous.
*  I'd like to thank the Minnesota Timberwolves for coming back from 20 in a game seven.
*  Yeah, it was a little rock, paper, scissors with Minnesota, Denver and Dallas, because I think Denver would be in Dallas.
*  And for whatever reason, Minnesota was able to beat Denver and ran out of gas.
*  And I keep thinking big picture about who knows?
*  We talked about the health stuff, but then you think about Milwaukee.
*  They're going to be back. They're going to have the eye of the tiger.
*  We'll see what Philly does that they can get Paul George or whoever.
*  Miami can always pull like some crazy move out of their ass.
*  Who knows if Orlando is going to assign somebody.
*  So these will definitely be better than the Knicks, whatever they do, they're going to be a problem.
*  So we should have six teams plus whatever happens with Cleveland.
*  Then the West, you have Denver, Dallas, this Dallas team now have a full year.
*  And I'm sure they'll add somebody.
*  Minnesota, OKC, which I'm sure is going to do something.
*  Memphis is coming back.
*  But the good thing is only one team can come out of the West.
*  Fortunately, they they knock each other off.
*  You know, a lot of outside of Boston, people will say we lucked out.
*  We played a Cleveland team where Mitchell got hurt.
*  We played a Miami team where Butler didn't play.
*  Yeah, we played an Indiana team where the point guard.
*  I don't remember anyone saying this about the 2013 Heat.
*  I'm saying that when they were beating the Pacers without Danny Granger and it was basically just Paul George or Roy Hibbert and David West.
*  Nobody in it. And there was like no other competition.
*  I want to repeat one thing we talked about in the other podcast because Adam Silver said it today to the to the.
*  The team that's won the most championships, 18.
*  One more than the Lakers.
*  The Lakers cheat, though.
*  Can we throw away the Minnesota game championships?
*  They count like five Minnesota championships.
*  You know what I heard?
*  I think they're going to count the end season championship, too.
*  So I think they're like your fans think they're still tied.
*  Let's cut this out as a social clip.
*  You guys can't count the Minnesota titles.
*  They don't count and you can't say you stole the team from Minnesota.
*  You don't get to count the titles and you can't count the end season tournament as it world championship.
*  Every time I argue with the Laker fans about this, because I know a bunch of them obviously live in L.A.
*  And they're like, well, there was still there were still called the Lakers.
*  And Elgin was on the Minnesota team.
*  And I'm like, OK, do OKC fans count the 1979 Sonics team is like, oh, well, we got that one title with the Sonics.
*  Like, no, they don't.
*  So so in my mind, in my mind, it's 18 to 12.
*  I took a lot of shit from the Laker fans, both in my life and people who listen and read about how we had only won one title since 1986.
*  That's a big, big 2008.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  But it was like last 38 years, one title.
*  By the way, our drought's over.
*  Our five and a half year Boston title drought.
*  I know you're starting to get hairy about it.
*  Well, I'm already thinking about the parade on Wednesday when it's 100 degrees out.
*  It's going to be an interesting. You got to go.
*  It's going to go right. It's going to go right down the street.
*  All right. So rank the teams.
*  Let's hear it.
*  Favorite Celtics teams of all time.
*  Favorite champs.
*  We have seven to pick from.
*  Seventy four, seventy six, eighty one, eighty four, eighty six, oh, eight and twenty four.
*  I guess your top three. I don't want to have a number seven and then I'd say eighty six is my top.
*  The bird apex season tonight's.
*  Two thousand twenty four is my second top.
*  Really over eighty one and eighty one is my third top.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I just always hoped for one more championship.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's so hard to get there.
*  It's so hard to get through all the rounds you have to get through, hoping that you're going to stay healthy.
*  The Western teams have been pretty tough this whole season.
*  So whichever team we played was going to be tough.
*  And injuries, the poor Zingas injury kind of made us take a step back.
*  You know, is this going to cost us a championship?
*  And it's so hard to win.
*  It's just so hard to win.
*  And the other thing is I'm so happy that Brown and Tatum have been elevated.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, it's great that Horford won a championship.
*  But for Brown and Tatum, they had to get over the hump nationally.
*  And I think nationally, they looked at differently as of tonight.
*  They're champions.
*  Yeah.
*  We've seen that happen a few times over.
*  Like definitely 100 percent happened to Giannis.
*  Yeah.
*  Happened to Kawhi.
*  You've seen it happen.
*  Trying to think of other ones.
*  That first Warriors title.
*  Happened to Joe Mazzulli tonight.
*  Happened to our guy Joe.
*  Yeah, I was thinking about, I was walking around.
*  I was so nervous today.
*  I walked around all of Boston.
*  I walked to Cambridge.
*  I walked through Charlestown where I used to live.
*  I literally, I think I walked 27,000 steps.
*  So you were as nervous as I was?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Luca, it was so easy for him to score in game four that I just couldn't stop thinking about.
*  I was like, Luca might have like 48 tonight and just like suck our souls out.
*  And the history of basketball is sometimes if you have one guy on the other team, it was just awesome.
*  So I was just walking around and thinking about that.
*  And I was thinking about all the things that happened since we won in 08 when we felt like this team's got at least one more.
*  Right.
*  Then 09 KG gets hurt.
*  Right.
*  2010.
*  Perkins gets hurt in game six.
*  Perkins gets hurt in game six and freaking Rashid Wallace who we couldn't stand that year.
*  And then he has to play 35 minutes.
*  We blow game seven.
*  Artis hits it crazy three.
*  2011.
*  Make the Jeff Green trade.
*  Rondo hurts his elbow in that Miami series.
*  So that one's out.
*  2012.
*  We have the up three two and LeBron just sucks our souls out in game six and then Bosh hits in three and game seven.
*  13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
*  We were working to win those years.
*  18.
*  Really good chance.
*  Kyrie and Hayward's first season.
*  Hayward's out in six minutes.
*  Right.
*  We take Cleveland to a game seven anyway and LeBron was just unbelievable.
*  Beats us.
*  19, 20.
*  In the bubble.
*  Maybe.
*  But that team didn't feel like it.
*  Kembo was really bad in the bubble.
*  Our defense was bad.
*  21 bad year.
*  22.
*  I remember walking home with you after game five Milwaukee and we felt like we lost a title.
*  Right.
*  Because we were like the league's wide open.
*  We're going to get this.
*  Then they come back and win that.
*  And then Golden State just gets their mojo and they take it from us.
*  23.
*  We lose a game seven at home in Miami.
*  It was weirdly like a lot of downers.
*  It's weird.
*  You made me do the podcast after we lost to Golden State.
*  That was a tough one.
*  Yeah, that was almost a human rights violation.
*  I couldn't believe you pulled it off.
*  It was tough.
*  I mean, I really thought we were going to win that year.
*  Because one thing about my dad is he's still 100% in.
*  Like Hershey, my friend Hershey was telling a story about when we were in the 2013, I was doing the finals for TV.
*  So we're in San Antonio.
*  I was there.
*  And we watched the Bruins Blackhawks game in the hotel lobby.
*  Right.
*  And it went in a double OT, I think, in the Blackhawks scored.
*  And really like that killed the Bruins season.
*  And you just said, I'll see you guys later.
*  And you just left.
*  And Hershey looked at you and said, I'm going to win.
*  And Hershey looked at me.
*  It was like, I just want to care about sports that much when I'm older.
*  And now 10 years later, still there.
*  But I mean, when we left game seven last year that Miami, Tatum gets hurt in eight seconds.
*  It was awful.
*  And we were just like, what's going to happen to this team?
*  The chemistry was off with Marcus and Grant.
*  Right.
*  You got to credit these, the moves they made.
*  The trading Marcus was, and Marcus's name wasn't mentioned for the last two weeks.
*  But remember, they trade him.
*  I was like, who's heart and soul of the team?
*  You know, you just reminded me of something.
*  You know who we haven't talked about?
*  Brad Stevens.
*  I mean, the moves he's made after that horrendous seventh game lost to Miami last year.
*  And obviously he knew that team wasn't going to get over the hump, the way it was constructed.
*  Which is how we felt as well.
*  And we felt as well.
*  But not every general manager is going to make the moves he made.
*  I mean, they were risky.
*  It started with the Horford trade.
*  Gets Horford back, who seems like he's on his last legs just to get rid of the Kemba contract.
*  Gives up a pick for that.
*  The way trade, I remember when we found out there was a pick swap and it was only top one protected.
*  And like five years later, and we were like, oh my God, what if Tatum's not here?
*  It's an awful lot for a guy we never heard of.
*  Yeah, we heard it like Derek Leib, but Jesus.
*  And then the poor Zingas trade, which was just a great trade.
*  I still can't believe we got picks on that.
*  And then that led to the Drew trade, which was the all time no brainer.
*  Of course we have to do that.
*  But yeah, he did a great job.
*  Great job.
*  And in a bizarre.
*  To hire him as a college coach, they're going to tank for a couple of years.
*  And he's such a good coach that they kind of audible in a second, second season member.
*  They traded for Isaiah Thomas and I think they made, they got the eight seed.
*  And we were supposed to be losing intentionally.
*  And it was like, he was too good of a coach and then ran his course.
*  Like a lot of coaches.
*  It kind of ran his course in a weird way that you mentioned it earlier.
*  The Kyrie Irving stuff would kill any coach.
*  Yeah.
*  Would you feel Kyrie genuinely seem remorseful about how he behaved when he was here?
*  And I didn't know.
*  How about it with two minutes to go when two and a half minutes to go in Dallas, empty the bench, brought the starters out.
*  And Kyrie went to the Celtic bench and hugged every Celtic word.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he realized that would be ridiculous.
*  I mean, really?
*  Yeah.
*  There was like two and a half minutes left.
*  We're up 20, but still nervous somehow.
*  Yeah.
*  Still nervous.
*  Coming out of a timeout and Kyrie just go and he's hugging Joe Mazula and he's hugging Tatum.
*  And we're like, what the hell is he doing?
*  And then I realized white flag and you're like, we just won the championship.
*  I'm not nervous anymore.
*  See Kyrie, you knew when you saw Kyrie that we would win a championship.
*  When he started hugging people and kissing people, I knew we won the championship.
*  Trying to think what else we have to cover.
*  But what happens now?
*  Well, you know, almost the whole team comes back.
*  Yeah.
*  And we didn't talk about Witt Groesbeck, who I've gotten to know over the years.
*  I give him so much credit for spending the money he's spending to give us this championship team.
*  Yeah, because you go back to the 2000s and he made all the typical usual mistakes a new owner makes.
*  And then eventually the 08 happens.
*  But I think he is clearly one of the three best owners in the league.
*  But all you can ask for from an owner is like, do you give a shit about the team?
*  Will you spend money?
*  Is money no object to get where you need to go?
*  Are you going to hire the best people around you?
*  One of the things that I, because I hung out with Boston people a lot when I was in Dallas.
*  This organization has been together.
*  It's really rare to have an organization of people that have just been there for a while.
*  They have the president, the CMO, the CFO.
*  You go on down the line, the head of sales, they're all the same people that were there in the 2000s.
*  And they really value loyalty, continuity.
*  The people they hired, they're all in on the team.
*  And it's really hard to pull off.
*  And he pulled it off.
*  You're right.
*  I remember in 2010 when I went out to LA for games six and seven and got a chance to meet all those people.
*  They're still here.
*  They're still here.
*  They're all still here.
*  It's incredible.
*  And I think just big picture, like you have guys like Tatum and Brown.
*  They really do value certain character guys.
*  And maybe they learned the hard way that that's a good thing to look for.
*  But I think Brad, I think that's why you go after White.
*  That's why you go after Drew.
*  So I don't know.
*  Character guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Character guys.
*  And character coaches.
*  Well, I was saying as somebody who was talking about Drew with a basketball friend of mine, I was just like,
*  Drew is like exactly the 0304 Patriots when we won the two Super Bowls.
*  And we had all those dudes like Vrabel and Pruski and Rodney Harrison.
*  And it was just like guys who just wanted to fucking win.
*  And that was it.
*  And Drew is just like that.
*  He didn't care less what his stats are.
*  It's like, what do we need?
*  What do we need me to do tonight to have to guard Luca?
*  Do you need me to actually like handle the basketball?
*  He just doesn't care.
*  He's going to do what it takes.
*  And it's obvious his teammates really, really love him.
*  And he impresses them with his character.
*  Yeah.
*  He was kind of like the quiet leader of the team.
*  And then White was just such a delight.
*  What a roller coaster ride with that guy.
*  Remember in 2022, we were like, is this guy, can we play this guy in the playoffs?
*  Can he score?
*  Can you shoot?
*  Can he make a basket?
*  He went cold for two straight weeks.
*  And we were talking about like the Derek White face.
*  Shaved his head.
*  It feels like that helped him.
*  That must have helped.
*  And he has a family now.
*  He's a family man.
*  I don't know.
*  He got so much confidence this year.
*  Yeah.
*  He credited Missoula for all of it.
*  He's like that Missoula's willed me to be a great guy.
*  And I watched when White came out tonight, he went over and he and Missoula really very
*  affectionately hugged each other with respect.
*  Yeah.
*  So for popular Boston teams, 04 Red Sox is at the top top.
*  Always will be.
*  Yeah.
*  We're never topping that.
*  Yeah.
*  15 Pats, the deflate gate and then beating Baltimore at home, beating Indianapolis and
*  then beating Seattle, coming back in the Super Bowl, I feel like.
*  And then having the whole deflate gate thing and it became less against them.
*  I think that was the most popular of all the Pats teams for me.
*  Just like, and Brady's at the peak of his powers.
*  And even though 01 was amazing, but that was like a sports movie.
*  It didn't almost feel real.
*  Bruins, 2011 for the modern version.
*  And then if you're going backwards, there's some of those late seventies teams or even
*  the old teams.
*  Unfortunately, in the last 13, 14 years, they just can't get over the hump.
*  Right.
*  They don't have the speed that all these other teams seem to have.
*  But you know, you said it earlier, Celtics haven't won 16 years.
*  That's a long time.
*  This means a lot to the city.
*  Yeah, Tatum was 10 when they won.
*  This means a lot to the city of Boston.
*  And people listen, this are throwing up right now.
*  They're like, he had me fucking kidding me.
*  You guys have a hit title, two, six Pats, two Celtics, four Red Sox and a Bruins.
*  Yeah.
*  We've had 13 titles this century.
*  So I have like, I mean, I have like a next Nicks Jets Mets fan.
*  Yeah.
*  Friends of my life.
*  I don't have to worry about what you worry about.
*  I don't have people in other cities.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  You only get to see people from this city.
*  I mean, I only see people in Boston.
*  So I'm sorry that you have that problem, but I don't have that problem.
*  Plus you were on the cover of the Boston Globe on Friday.
*  I was on Friday.
*  They wrote a piece about longtime Celtics fans and ticket holders.
*  And somehow there's a photo of you just staring out the window.
*  It was a good photo.
*  Do you think anyone under 50 saw the, saw the, the people under 50 get newspapers?
*  Well, it was also online.
*  People read it online.
*  But I might've bought a few copies of the newspaper.
*  You got to start thinking about your personal brand.
*  Now you're like Tatum, Tatum and Jalen.
*  I've been asking for my own podcast and you seem to be denying it.
*  The boot plate special.
*  I think out of all the biggest surprises from this year, if you told me when Jalen got that contract, how is this going to go?
*  They're just sort of been like, well, there's one scenario where they actually win the title and he's the second best player.
*  There's another scenario where he tries to justify the deal and it screws up our entire season and we trade him in the summer.
*  I did not have the scenario where it's like, he's going to go up a level.
*  He's going to be one of the best two-wear players in the league.
*  He's going to become one of the best forwards in the league along with Tatum.
*  And he's going to win the conference finals MVP in the finals MVP.
*  I did not have that on my bingo card.
*  No, I didn't either.
*  And I thought the first quarter of the year, he was trying to justify that contract.
*  Yeah, no question.
*  And then eventually somebody must have gotten to him or whatever, but he played differently in the second half of the year.
*  Because he's one of those guys, he was always in the border of frustrating Celtics territory.
*  Because I remember going way back when we had the tickets in the late 70s, early 80s, Rick Roby.
*  And I remember there was a couple of people in our section.
*  Rick Roby just drove them crazy.
*  Remember the Goldbergs?
*  And it would be like Roby would just fumble something out of bounds.
*  And the guy who was like the nicest guy would be like, Roby!
*  He was just so mad.
*  And over the years you have these frustrating Celtics.
*  And part of me always wondered is Jalen, that's who's going to be this guy who's 20 points a game and a really good player, but frustrating?
*  They had it when they had the draft where we picked Jalen Brown.
*  Yeah, they booed.
*  They had a draft party and I took your daughter, I took my granddaughter Zoe to the draft party.
*  And I guess the fans who were at the draft party wanted Murray.
*  And when they picked Jalen Brown, they booed.
*  Which was stupid.
*  Really stupid.
*  But that's what you get with those stupid gatherings.
*  But yeah, that wasn't a great way to start.
*  And obviously he knows all about that.
*  I think a couple of times he's referenced it actually.
*  He does so many things within the city and I think people know some of it, but not all of it.
*  He's been one of the most valuable off the court Celtics ever.
*  And that's something I've talked about in the pod over and over again.
*  You don't want to lose dudes like Tatum and Brown.
*  I mean, part of me thinks now that they've won the title, these guys could be a Bird McHale situation.
*  I saw Wick when I was in Dallas.
*  I don't think I'm betraying his confidence by telling this, but when that Brown extension comes up.
*  You mean the Tatum one?
*  No, Brown.
*  Oh, last year.
*  Last year.
*  You know, you could haggle with that one and try to get him for $2.99 or $2.89 or whatever.
*  And I think he would probably say this.
*  He was like, you know what?
*  We're paying him what the extension is.
*  He's worth it.
*  He's one of the best players in the league.
*  We're doing this.
*  They didn't want to because that last contract he had was a little bit of a discount.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And it's like he's like, this is one of our guys.
*  We're not I'm not trying to save a couple million a year on the salary cap.
*  I want this guy to make what he's worth because he's worth that much to us, which I think is a really great thing to do.
*  And they're going to do with Tatum too.
*  And I think as an owner, his relationship with the players reflects that kind of a decision.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the players.
*  Well, also that he knew the salary cap was about to go up.
*  Well, in five years, that contract is going to look like a discount, ironically.
*  Right. When Luca's playing for a hundred million dollars a year on Dallas.
*  When the new television contract is settled with the three different bidders, it's going to be crazy money.
*  Well, I wonder one of the things that happened with the Pats and this is like I know one of the dumb topics this week will be is the Celtics.
*  They can be dynasty. We do this every year.
*  I remember doing a segment about Denver last year.
*  Could they be a dynasty?
*  It's really hard to just keep winning titles.
*  But I think one thing that might happen is you might be able to grab a vet on the minute in a way like the way the Patriots were always because they want to play for this.
*  You're like, Oh, Junior, say I want to try to win a title with us.
*  And I wonder if that could happen because one of the best things with them is the East is probably a little easier in the West.
*  Like which conference would you rather be in?
*  I'd rather be in the East.
*  And with Philly, who knows of them bead? Milwaukee's old.
*  Miami's butlers in his mid 30s. You start going down the line.
*  It's like this is the safest bet in the East.
*  Right.
*  So could they steal somebody?
*  There's some second apron stuff with them that it takes.
*  Could they make it hard?
*  Even with the second apron stuff that's going to surface, you could see a veteran taking a discount.
*  I'm not sure the role players that we have now who's coming back.
*  I know they can.
*  They have how's our team option.
*  So he comes back.
*  They signed Prichard.
*  Cornett is a friend.
*  Maybe not.
*  Maybe not. I'd like to see him come back.
*  And why wouldn't he come back if he got a fair offer?
*  Yeah, it seems like everybody loves us.
*  Yeah.
*  My daughter is always Simmons, who was a fetus during the 2004 Red Sox run and then showed up.
*  And within a couple of years, the Celtics won and they just kept winning titles.
*  And we always called her the good luck charm.
*  And then she goes to school in Boston this year.
*  She saw a lot of games.
*  She's going to sell the games with you.
*  And then they win the title.
*  I just another feather in her cap.
*  So we should give her all the credit.
*  We'll give her a little bit.
*  Did you notice she didn't fly back for her?
*  She didn't fly back for game five.
*  That is true, but I'm not sure she had a seat either.
*  You're going to give her your seat?
*  Probably could have found one.
*  Yeah, probably.
*  Yeah.
*  But she was a good she was a good fan.
*  She's a good fan.
*  So this you had the combo of like you got to go to a bunch of games with her with your
*  wife.
*  We got to go to the finals.
*  This is a great start to finish season for you.
*  Perfect season.
*  And our drought's over.
*  I have no complaints.
*  I'm in on the coach.
*  What can I ask for?
*  Fifty one years, eleven finals, seven victories, seven titles.
*  What kind of hat t-shirt thing are you going to are you capable of?
*  I'd like one of those white championship.
*  Those are pretty hats.
*  They look kind of neat.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Well, thanks for taking me to all these games over the years.
*  You're welcome, son.
*  It was.
*  I still think 86 was my favorite.
*  I said that as well.
*  Yeah, I think that was the right call.
*  The 81 whole playoff run was probably my favorite.
*  The 81.
*  The Philly was still my favorite series I've ever won.
*  Beating the conference finals against Philly is my favorite series.
*  Yeah.
*  But it wasn't.
*  I moved this one up as my second favorite championship.
*  And then.
*  Probably best individual finals game we ever went to.
*  I would say was the heat game in the 84 finals game five.
*  When it was like 130 degrees and somehow Bird wasn't tired.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a great one.
*  And all the great stories.
*  But this is we'll remember this one.
*  This game, game five is it'll be the Tatum game, right?
*  It was like we wanted him to a big boy game and it happened.
*  Well, also it comes in the heels of a debacle three days, three nights earlier.
*  Where?
*  That nobody will ever remember.
*  Nobody will ever care about again.
*  But it made me you walked around Boston all day today.
*  Yeah.
*  I couldn't even watch TV.
*  I was so nervous.
*  So that's all gone.
*  We won the championship.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  Year 52 next year for you.
*  Dad, thanks for coming on.
*  We did it.
*  Seven titles.
