# NBA Playoffs/NFL Draft Odds, Masters Draft and More! | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=0.0s)]
*  Cousins, how is here our friend? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=0.6s)]
*  We walked the course today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2.88s)]
*  We're going to talk about that later. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4.36s)]
*  The masters, your agent, James baby doll. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=5.96s)]
*  Dixon is here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=8.32s)]
*  What a day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=9.48s)]
*  So much fun. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Uh, we'll talk about that next segment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=11.4s)]
*  We're going to talk about the Deborah nuggets and the West and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=13.64s)]
*  basketball and the NBA playoffs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=16.48s)]
*  Can I just first, uh, thank you guys for giving me some winning [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=18.76s)]
*  futures in the beginning of the year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=22.72s)]
*  I heard you talk about how you bet your own futures and lost. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=24.36s)]
*  Maybe you should come to me after your podcast so I could tell you who to bet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=28.08s)]
*  Uh, Houston makes the playoffs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=32.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=34.08s)]
*  Pelicans, no playoffs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=34.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Denver underwins. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=36.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=37.24s)]
*  Spurs underwins. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=37.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=38.8s)]
*  Suns over the loss. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=39.24s)]
*  Wizards under. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=41.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=42.12s)]
*  We did, we did, we did above average on our locks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm really upset about how we handled the Pacific, the LA teams, Sacramento [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=45.04s)]
*  and Phoenix Phoenix and the two LA teams. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=51.08s)]
*  It was ruined my over unders. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=53.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  Anyway, um, you just went over those twos went to crazy transformation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=56.48s)]
*  So it's not really anyway. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=61.72s)]
*  Uh, so the Denver nuggets, we have Fandol. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=62.8s)]
*  I introduced these to you kind of buried on the Fandol sports book [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=66.52s)]
*  MBA page where they have to advance each round and I don't remember [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=70.32s)]
*  seeing those last year. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=74.84s)]
*  I was incredibly fascinated by them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=75.96s)]
*  So round two to make round two, that means you're winning in round one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=79.12s)]
*  And we're taping this before a couple of the Tuesday night games. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  There's going to be some standing shenanigans. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  We have five teams that have 32 losses. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=88.84s)]
*  Denver is one of them who just fired their coach. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=91.04s)]
*  Is Denver in a post Malone time period? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=95.04s)]
*  Right now? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=97.76s)]
*  This is good. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=98.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Where's the drummer? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=101.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=104.12s)]
*  See is minus 1300 to make round two house. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=104.48s)]
*  And that jumped out to me immediately because what if they played Minnesota [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=108.36s)]
*  or the Clippers, I think, okay, see would beat either of those teams, but I don't [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=113.28s)]
*  think they're 13 to one favorites to beat the Clippers if that was the series. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  Or golden state. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=123.08s)]
*  Because those guys, both the Clippers and Minnesota super short prices as, as dogs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  It must be that they think Memphis is going to be the eight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=131.4s)]
*  Cause Memphis is plus three 50. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=133.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  And I honestly, that does make sense. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=135.84s)]
*  I should have actually, I should have mentioned that too. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=137.56s)]
*  So Clippers are plus one 30 to make round two. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=139.28s)]
*  Minnesota is plus one 54 to make round two. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=142.0s)]
*  Memphis is plus three 50, but okay. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=144.36s)]
*  See is minus 1300. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  If it feels like it doesn't make sense, it doesn't make sense. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=149.72s)]
*  Memphis is even the eight at plus three 50. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=151.8s)]
*  Fandle screwed up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=154.44s)]
*  Thanks for sending us out here, but they screwed up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=155.28s)]
*  They're not smart. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=157.84s)]
*  We love you, but you didn't, you added something wrong here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=158.52s)]
*  And then the Lakers are minus one 72 gold states, minus one 52. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=162.72s)]
*  Denver is plus one Oh six and Houston is plus one 14, which was another one [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=166.52s)]
*  that jumped out to me because they're going to have, we know they had, we [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  know they're the two seed they're playing as well as they played all season. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=175.0s)]
*  And it's two seven and I just think they're going to be favored. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=179.88s)]
*  So if I get them at plus one 14, that's great. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=182.88s)]
*  But, uh, I think that whole list, what shocked you the most out of those 18? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, that's weird. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=189.28s)]
*  Now that you bring it up, if Houston is going to be a two seed as a underdog, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  If you're guaranteed, they're not guaranteed, but looking good. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  Two seed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=198.52s)]
*  Has that happened in a while where two seeds and underdog? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=199.8s)]
*  I mean, that jumped out every once in a while there, like Memphis had that year [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=202.44s)]
*  where they were the two seed, but nobody believed in it and there was good value [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=205.84s)]
*  in them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  Let's price it cause because let's say it's Houston against Minnesota, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=209.44s)]
*  They won't be an underdog to Minnesota. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  It'll be like very close to even ons. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  Don't you think there'll be a tiny favorite because their home, they'll have one. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=222.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=223.32s)]
*  So right now, Minnesota seven and Memphis is eight and Houston's to argue, be [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=223.48s)]
*  playing one of those gold state has two easy games. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  The next two Denver just fired their coach. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  They've lost four in a row and they're going to be playing the Kings, the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Grizzlies at home, and then at Houston in the last game of the season, which [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Houston might not care about because they'll have the two seed locked up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  I think Minnesota versus Houston, just fundamentally, if that's a two, seven [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=252.24s)]
*  series house, where would your money be in that series? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=256.24s)]
*  I'm definitely betting on Minnesota. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=260.52s)]
*  There's no, that's how I feel about it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  I guarantee you cause they screwed us enough. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=263.92s)]
*  We have this big parlay that needs Minnesota to run the table losing wise to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=266.44s)]
*  pay off and it actually might be over by now because it's probably Tuesday night. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=276.08s)]
*  So we just want to figure out how much we want our teeth kicked in by Minnesota. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  What would you set that line at? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=280.24s)]
*  I mean, I think your house is right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=281.4s)]
*  Like Houston only because they're home with home, you know, one minus one 25 or [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=283.52s)]
*  something. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=287.96s)]
*  So maybe that, that explains these prices. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=288.08s)]
*  I guess the problem for Fandel and just trying to set these prices in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=291.52s)]
*  general is if you have one upset one, anything happening. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=294.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=300.2s)]
*  You don't want to know all of a sudden I have Denver plus one Oh six, but all [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=300.64s)]
*  of a sudden they're in the seventh spot playing Houston and maybe they'd be [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=305.88s)]
*  favored in that series because of Yoke. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=310.8s)]
*  Would who would you have favored in Denver, Houston? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=312.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=315.48s)]
*  So now you're talking. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=315.72s)]
*  Houston's good. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=316.76s)]
*  I I'd be, I'd be a little, I'd bet Minnesota, but I don't think I'd put a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=317.64s)]
*  lot of money on that one. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=321.8s)]
*  I saw too many games with Houston where from the eight minute mark in the fourth [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=322.88s)]
*  quarter to the end of the game, they turn flaccid. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=327.52s)]
*  Did you see anything? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=331.24s)]
*  What they turned limp. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you see anything of what I'm in Thompson did to curry in that game though? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=333.2s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=336.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=337.32s)]
*  I thought that was, he just said, I'm going to go to the game. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  He just took out now, curry the problem with Golden state and why they're going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=340.52s)]
*  to be so hard to figure out is they're an older team, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=344.76s)]
*  Their best three guys are either old or getting old and they have a situation [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  like they play two really hard Thursday, Friday games, and then they play Sunday [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=352.96s)]
*  against that young, big, powerful Rockets team and they just looked old. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=356.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=360.84s)]
*  Um, but at the same time, I thought the Rockets, they beat okay. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=361.2s)]
*  Seeing going state in the same weekend. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=366.4s)]
*  They're good with nothing to play for. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  And they talk a bunch of shit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=369.12s)]
*  They're good. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=370.48s)]
*  I like it was talking shit to Steph. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=371.0s)]
*  I mean, this just shows me that Fandel hates Houston to make them a plus number [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=373.8s)]
*  as a two seed most likely, and then we don't have to go on to the next round, but [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  to make the West finals a plus four 70 playing the four or five seed, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=383.88s)]
*  So Houston, sorry, the, the, the three 16 and my, I should have flagged this for [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=389.8s)]
*  you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  Houston was plus seven 90, like five days ago to make the Western finals. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=394.88s)]
*  Two seed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=399.8s)]
*  They were basically getting eight to one odds. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  And if you just price that out, they're going to be the favorites [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=403.04s)]
*  are close in both series, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=406.16s)]
*  Um, Houston's plus four 70. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=408.48s)]
*  Now I think looking at the odds, the shocking thing to me is how much [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  respect they give the Lakers and how afraid, and I'm not saying it's right or [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  wrong. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=421.32s)]
*  I'm just saying the Lakers are being treated almost like they're a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=421.64s)]
*  defending champ type situation. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=425.4s)]
*  They're minus one 72 to win around. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=427.23999999999995s)]
*  They're plus one 68 to win two rounds. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=429.88s)]
*  And there's a chance they might, you know, maybe they don't even have [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=433.44s)]
*  home court in round two, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=436.88s)]
*  Potentially they couldn't, but it just seems like a lot of people that might be [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  respect that might be different from you said, there just might be a lot of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=444.64s)]
*  tickets on the Lakers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=447.32s)]
*  Like right after that Luka trade, everyone must've just dialed into them [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=448.36s)]
*  and bet them the west. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=451.72s)]
*  Scared of that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=452.76s)]
*  So there's a lot of liability there, but, but I do think for the West finals, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=453.48s)]
*  all right. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=458.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=458.92s)]
*  C minus two 90 throw that out of there. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=459.2s)]
*  If you think Denver's done, you got a nice opportunity to make some money [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  here, picking either the Lakers or golden state or the Clippers. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, the problem is if Denver drops to seven out of nowhere and it's Houston [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=469.2s)]
*  versus Denver and a two seven, I think looking at the odds, the best odds to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=473.16s)]
*  me seem to be Minnesota to make the West finals. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=477.76s)]
*  I think the odds have adjusted correctly, but Minnesota basically seven to one to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=480.84s)]
*  make the West finals to win two rounds. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=485.0s)]
*  I'm going to, we need to take a break for this podcast so I can go. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=487.08s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=490.88s)]
*  Oh, to make it, I got to go make a bet. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=491.56s)]
*  I thought it was a bathroom thing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=493.2s)]
*  It could be both. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=494.68s)]
*  I can do it in the bathroom. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=495.32s)]
*  We did eat a lot of pizza today because I really wanted the clips to have better [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  odds, cause I thought maybe they would be the sleeper pick, but plus four [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=501.64s)]
*  20 to win two rounds. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=505.6s)]
*  Isn't there's no value in that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=506.72s)]
*  No, no. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=508.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=508.72s)]
*  And there, there might be underdogs, both rounds. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=511.12s)]
*  And if you really wanted to get nuts, do Memphis plus 15 50 to win two rounds. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=512.32s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=517.48s)]
*  It's just throwing, but there's a chance they could get the seven seed and be in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  the two seven, right? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=523.48s)]
*  That would be the case that Memphis Houston would be awesome. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=524.08s)]
*  That would be an awesome series. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=527.72s)]
*  But that's two series at plus four 50 and plus 300. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=529.4s)]
*  Would that be what they are in the first two series? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  So that's basically what 15 50 is. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=536.32s)]
*  So how's it for that first round? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  The advanced around to if somehow the Clippers are the eight seed and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=542.5200000000001s)]
*  okay, sees the one seed and you have okay. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=548.2s)]
*  See at minus 1300 to advance around to you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=552.24s)]
*  I would be fucking nervous with that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  Cause I think, I think, I don't think the clips can beat okay. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=556.84s)]
*  See, but I think they can make you nervous if you have a lot of okay. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=559.8800000000001s)]
*  See money, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=562.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=564.28s)]
*  Positively. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=564.88s)]
*  I wouldn't know part of that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=565.52s)]
*  If you, if Kawhi, it seems like we're going to, I want to, should knock on [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  wood, there's some wood in this house, some fine marble I see, but I'm going [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=570.0s)]
*  to knock on some wood because we want quite healthy for the first round. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=573.44s)]
*  I don't think they're going to drop though. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=578.2s)]
*  The Clippers are playing too, too well. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=579.48s)]
*  And their last three games are, are reasonable for them. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=582.4s)]
*  So here's the real value. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=585.36s)]
*  So to make the finals, this is three rounds. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=586.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=590.36s)]
*  He's minus one 45 Lakers plus six 50. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=590.64s)]
*  I just don't think that's, they're making the underdogs of those. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=594.6s)]
*  It's you have to win three rounds to win the Western conference. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=598.48s)]
*  That's the bet you have to Lakers plus six 50, Golden state, seven, one Denver, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=601.28s)]
*  10 one clip 16 one Minnesota, 21 to one Houston, 24 to one, uh, and Memphis 70 to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=606.6s)]
*  one. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=614.24s)]
*  So the case for Golden state or the Lakers is this other than that they have [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=615.12s)]
*  famous players and a good infrastructure and all that stuff. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=618.88s)]
*  What is your record have to be? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=622.36s)]
*  What's the worst possible record you could have to make the Western finals? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=624.28s)]
*  Little math question for you guys. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=627.64s)]
*  I mean, including the play out, like all that first three rounds, what's the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=630.04s)]
*  worst record you could have and still make the finals? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=633.36s)]
*  Uh, four, three, four, five. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=636.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=638.52s)]
*  12, nine, 12, 12 and nine. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=639.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=641.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=642.08s)]
*  So if you think of it that way, it's like, could a team with Luca and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=643.2s)]
*  LeBron go 12 and nine over 21 games? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=646.76s)]
*  It's like, yeah, that seems realistic. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=649.84s)]
*  Kind of like Golden state could go and stay, go 12 and nine for three rounds. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=651.76s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, they're going to have a game like that Sunday where they look [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=655.88s)]
*  old, Steph has three points, you know, even think of like when they played Memphis [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=659.3199999999999s)]
*  a couple of years ago and 22, and they got blown out in game five and they just [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  won in game six. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=668.96s)]
*  When you think about 12 and nine, it's just not that hard. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=670.36s)]
*  I like the way you're going. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=673.92s)]
*  It's because we usually look at this at this point of year, like, all right, who's [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=675.24s)]
*  the toughest out? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=678.84s)]
*  Who's the toughest to beat four times? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=679.84s)]
*  If you do it that way, 12 and nine is doable. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=681.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=685.92s)]
*  I think about the Lakers like 12 and nine. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=686.16s)]
*  Let's say there's three incredible Luca games. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=689.24s)]
*  There's three. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=691.32s)]
*  Let's give LeBron two incredible LeBron games. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=692.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=695.84s)]
*  Now I have five. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=696.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=697.24s)]
*  Let's give Reeves one awesome game where they win just cause Reeves is great. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=697.52s)]
*  And I have six of the 12. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=703.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=704.8s)]
*  Now let's have a LeBron and Luca are awesome in the same game game. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  There's two more. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=708.36s)]
*  You can get to 12 pretty easily. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=709.72s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=711.24s)]
*  I think those odds are inflated. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=711.9599999999999s)]
*  It's weird because we, we just said a lot of people might have Lakers tickets, but [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=713.72s)]
*  when we talk about the toughest out Oklahoma city is the toughest to beat four times, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=717.52s)]
*  probably, but not six times as tough as the Lakers to beat four times. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=721.68s)]
*  Well, so here's the case for OKC. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=725.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=727.48s)]
*  They're going to finish the season 68 and 14, 67 and 15, and then it becomes math. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=728.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  So over six months, they lost 14 times. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=734.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=739.3199999999999s)]
*  And now we're going to get to the playoffs and they're going to lose nine times in 21 [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=739.72s)]
*  games. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=743.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=743.6s)]
*  That's where it gets stupid. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=743.88s)]
*  This was the case for the Celtics last year. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=744.92s)]
*  At some point the math takes over. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=747.24s)]
*  Um, but okay. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=749.4s)]
*  See, they get their ass kicked the other night against the, the other day [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=750.64s)]
*  against the Lakers and it's like, why do they get their ass kicked? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=753.4s)]
*  Were they showing anything? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=756.56s)]
*  Are they just, do they call off the dogs or did this actually mean something? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=757.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=761.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=762.48s)]
*  Um, Houston seems to be, I would say most disrespected in the West. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=763.2800000000001s)]
*  I think it's appropriate. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=769.52s)]
*  I think it's fine. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=770.6s)]
*  They're going to be the two seed and they're going to have home court in [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=771.32s)]
*  the first two rounds. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=774.32s)]
*  True story. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=775.32s)]
*  24 to one is, is a good price. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=777.0s)]
*  The two seed getting the seventh best seed, uh, odds is remarkable. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=779.8000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=786.08s)]
*  24 to one. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=788.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  For all three of those categories, Houston's getting ripped. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=789.48s)]
*  Um, all right, Sal, a couple other things for you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=792.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=795.44s)]
*  Who do you want Dallas to take with the 12th pick in the draft? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=796.28s)]
*  Yeah, I want alignment. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=798.84s)]
*  I know there's like two, it's just crazy. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=800.4s)]
*  I know we're going to screw this up, but I know I kind of love it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=802.8s)]
*  Fun talking about the Arizona receiver or talking about like, this is a team [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=806.6s)]
*  that needs everything in my head. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=811.36s)]
*  Like everybody who roots for their team, like, Oh, we need like eight positions. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=812.44s)]
*  Not you house you free agent in every way. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=815.64s)]
*  You're waiting to play off eight defensive positions. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=817.76s)]
*  Give us alignment. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=821.72s)]
*  I don't know exactly which one is going to drop to us because, uh, you know, we [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=823.2s)]
*  lost one of the best in the game. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=826.96s)]
*  So I was looking at the draft odds. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=829.08s)]
*  Sadly, it seems like the draft has shook out in a way that's not great for the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=831.52s)]
*  New England Patriots where it came words. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=836.28s)]
*  One seems like Hunter's going to be two. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=838.04s)]
*  He's minus two 80 now to go to Cleveland. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=842.9200000000001s)]
*  And then Carter is now minus one 70 on Fandl to be the third pick. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=846.24s)]
*  Oh, you were really hoping for Siddor to sneak in there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=850.48s)]
*  And I don't think it's happening in Sanders. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  He's four to one to go third. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  He's 17 to one to go second. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=856.56s)]
*  And I think the odds are probably better that he's going to fall. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=858.76s)]
*  Um, there's a team to draft Siddor Sanders odds that I thought was pretty fun [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=863.28s)]
*  because you can really take it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=869.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Dallas is 26 to one. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=872.8s)]
*  So you could take a couple of these. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=874.64s)]
*  This is like a nice roulette thing, right? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=876.64s)]
*  We put money on a few numbers. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=878.36s)]
*  I never get it right though. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=880.6s)]
*  Well, if people are right and, and I think it feels like as somebody who's [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=882.64s)]
*  watched a lot of this draft stuff and a couple of people have kind of like, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=889.12s)]
*  eh, I'm not sure you might be closer to Indy Dalton than people realize, but [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=892.72s)]
*  nobody really wants to come out and say, I don't think he's a top five pick. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=896.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  He's not good enough. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=900.04s)]
*  Nobody has come out strongly, but I think that's coming. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=900.84s)]
*  And if he does the Aaron Rogers slide into the late part of round one, right. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=904.52s)]
*  And we start going into like, I don't know. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=910.1999999999999s)]
*  Um, Miami range 27 to one. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=915.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=921.88s)]
*  Maybe even some before that. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=922.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=923.56s)]
*  Colts 22. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=923.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=924.52s)]
*  Seattle 22 to one Rams 11 to one. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=925.92s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense to me, honestly. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=930.4s)]
*  Steelers plus four 50, but it seems like there's some sort of value [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=932.24s)]
*  there that we're not seeing. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=937.8399999999999s)]
*  Um, the other thing I was looking at was it, the pets trade back. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=939.36s)]
*  I think Gentie is, uh, seems like he's going to have some real [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=946.8399999999999s)]
*  juice as the draft gets closer. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=951.36s)]
*  Raiders are minus one 45 for him. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=953.52s)]
*  They're picking six. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=955.9599999999999s)]
*  And if the, if they get scared, somebody's going to be frog them. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=957.0s)]
*  Maybe they just move up two spots with the pats. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=962.08s)]
*  If the pats want to take a left tackle, but, uh, him going to the Raiders is [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=964.2s)]
*  minus one 45 saints is nine to one. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=968.48s)]
*  And then your team South 15 to one. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  I just, it's so funny. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=973.64s)]
*  Cause I would even look further down because to me, it's still like, all [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=974.6800000000001s)]
*  right, if these GMs wise enough or running back that early, just even in [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=978.0s)]
*  the first round, but that early should only go to a team that's one piece away. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=981.84s)]
*  From making the playoffs or making a deep run in the playoffs. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=987.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=989.52s)]
*  That's not your team. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=990.64s)]
*  It's not the Raiders. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=991.6s)]
*  Probably not the bears. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=992.84s)]
*  The only case for my team for sure. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=993.96s)]
*  But the only case for my team is if they're like, this is a Peyton Manning [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=995.96s)]
*  edge, James situation, we'll have our two guys. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1000.72s)]
*  We won't be able to block for either of them, but we have, we, this is [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  an emits, mid tray equipment. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1007.88s)]
*  Like there's, there's a model here for this. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1009.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'm pretty consistent with this. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1011.88s)]
*  Like if you're picking that high, I need to get somebody that in free agency in [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1013.8399999999999s)]
*  four to five years is going to be like a $30 million a year guy and running [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1018.0s)]
*  backs don't make that much, you know, tackles do cornerbacks do pass rushers [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1021.8399999999999s)]
*  do, and I just feel like if you're picking that high, even if they took Mason [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1027.28s)]
*  Graham, it's like, that's a guy that will, if he's good, we'll be like a [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1031.24s)]
*  25 to $30 million a year player. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1035.08s)]
*  A running back will not, but once you're in the range you're in, it starts to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1037.68s)]
*  get more interesting than you're in that Jamiro Gibbs range. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1041.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1044.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1044.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't think, you know, I think you've got your player that everyone [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1045.28s)]
*  needs to be excited about and that's your coach. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1049.0s)]
*  So now you don't have to, you know, kowtow to the fans. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  You could draft smart and go back to drafting smart. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  Like you do. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1058.52s)]
*  I mean, I think like Denver at 75 to one, like kind of one ish piece away from, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1059.16s)]
*  from doing that, you know, running back by committee. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1064.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1067.72s)]
*  And it was not very successful. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1069.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1070.04s)]
*  So that makes it. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1070.5600000000002s)]
*  I like that price a lot. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1071.4s)]
*  The Dallas Cowboys are seven to one to take a running back to take a running [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1073.2s)]
*  back for us to take a running back first plus two 30 to take a receiver. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1077.88s)]
*  Um, yeah, you can do that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1082.52s)]
*  Fando has all these positions. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1083.96s)]
*  That's a lot of fun. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1087.68s)]
*  The kid from North Carolina has been getting a ton of, they're starting to do [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1088.6000000000001s)]
*  this thing about, you know, is this a B John Robinson, Jamiro Gibbs kind of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1092.8000000000002s)]

*  I pray edge. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  I pray one of the guys, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1101.76s)]
*  that's plus one 70 on Fando. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1104.24s)]
*  Make perfect sense. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1106.1999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1107.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1107.4399999999998s)]
*  That's the lowest odds for the position. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1107.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  I, the one that they don't have yet that I think they should have is who's going [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1111.6s)]
*  to be the second quarterback drafted. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1116.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1118.84s)]
*  They usually do start, start, start versus Sanders is a really fun one. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1119.08s)]
*  Cause couldn't you see the saints just taking dart ninth out of nowhere. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1124.6799999999998s)]
*  Like, Whoa, like one of those. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1127.8s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1131.28s)]
*  Then dart, like it's so funny. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1132.2s)]
*  Cause now we see how many people show up. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1133.56s)]
*  Everybody reports on how many giants showed up for should door Sanders pro day. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1135.8s)]
*  You know, it's like 37 giants and we're 14 players and three front office guys. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1140.32s)]
*  It ends up being like ratings for this and that affects the odds. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1144.6s)]
*  Like how many, you know, so that's why people think, but yeah, the same thing [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1148.16s)]
*  for, uh, what you're saying here, I could see it well speaking of effect in the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1151.28s)]
*  odds, you know, Fandel there, they've been an awesome partner to us that they're [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1155.72s)]
*  the reason we're here at the masters right now. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1161.08s)]
*  And occasionally I'll, I'll text them and badger them and make them do props [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1163.16s)]
*  and that's the stuff, including some golf ones that we're going to talk about [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  in one second, but, uh, I made them do an exact order bet. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1170.92s)]
*  This is my dream scenario for the pats, which was cam ward, Sanders Hunter. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1175.44s)]
*  We get Abdul Carter fourth. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1179.6000000000001s)]
*  So they put that up, they priced it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1181.52s)]
*  They had their, uh, their trading desk price and it's plus seven 50 for that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1183.08s)]
*  For some, this was two weeks ago. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1189.48s)]
*  It's now 17 to one. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1192.0s)]
*  No, they're just dropping their, their increase in the odds. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1196.08s)]
*  Cause what happened to they, they send in some tariffs, no buyers. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1198.96s)]
*  There was there should North standards. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1203.04s)]
*  Tariff wasn't, uh, did not turn out the market. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1204.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1208.44s)]
*  What is it? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1209.0s)]
*  What happened that made that go out that aside from the one thing that happened [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1209.44s)]
*  is Sanders, it became clear. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1212.76s)]
*  He wasn't going to go two or three. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1214.32s)]
*  But, um, for the, for the top five pick that was the other one I was looking at. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1223.4s)]
*  And Mason Graham is minus one 40. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1223.68s)]
*  And I just don't see how he falls past Jacksonville at five. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1227.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1230.28s)]
*  Either somebody, either the paths take them, which I'd be fine with. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1230.8s)]
*  Cause then they would have an awesome D line with hopefully bar more is healthy [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1234.92s)]
*  guy they signed from Philly. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1238.68s)]
*  They spent a lot of money on, um, and Graham, that sounds great. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1239.8s)]
*  Let's have an awesome D line or Jacksonville takes it, but that's minus one 40. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  It seems like good odds. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1248.92s)]
*  It gets a little scarier after that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1249.84s)]
*  Like will Campbell, the left tackle everyone thinks the paths are going to take. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1251.36s)]
*  I just don't think they take them at minus one 35. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1255.56s)]
*  I think they trade back a couple of spots if they're taking them. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1257.96s)]
*  Cause nobody else is going to take them. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1260.4s)]
*  Is, is the NFL draft or the mock draft, the biggest, all right, we're full of [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1261.92s)]
*  shit, but you have no choice, but to follow us. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1267.0s)]
*  No, I honestly, I think it's like the Denver, the Malone, uh, booth thing. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1269.84s)]
*  I think there's so much scuttlebutt and I think they talked to so many people [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1275.08s)]
*  and I think these guys get real info. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1278.12s)]
*  They end up six out of 32. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1279.56s)]
*  And if there's one trade, it's screws. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1281.2s)]
*  No, but I'm saying info about who's kind of. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1282.68s)]
*  Who's looking for one now we know of Sanders is going to be a top four [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1285.72s)]
*  picker and he's just not, it's not happening. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1289.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1291.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1291.96s)]
*  So maybe if you, so we know stuff like that, you could outline the top three or [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1292.28s)]
*  four, but after that, like, we know cam ward, like Tennessee's taking it. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1295.16s)]
*  Like we've done that for a little while. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1298.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1301.1999999999998s)]
*  No, I'm just saying Joe Leonardo goes, uh, 67 to 68 gets death threats. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1301.4399999999998s)]
*  And then everybody else like Kuiper goes seven for 32. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1305.6399999999999s)]
*  It's like, yeah, great job. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1310.52s)]
*  Well, because the NFL has teams like Atlanta who drew draft Michael [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1311.0s)]
*  Penick's junior at number nine. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1316.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1318.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1318.8s)]
*  Everything gets like, no, like, Hey, uh, I'm zagging pretty good pick. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1318.9199999999998s)]
*  No, but that's what I'm saying. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1324.56s)]
*  You might as well be the first pick of this draft. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1325.48s)]
*  It's a great pick. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1327.88s)]
*  If you, if you don't care about money, if you just don't care about money, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1328.7600000000002s)]
*  don't bet minus one 70 on anything just because, because I think that's great. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1334.64s)]
*  If I, so absolutely with that said, um, Genti plus eight 50, I think is a [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1340.44s)]
*  really interesting bet for where for top five pick. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1350.0800000000002s)]
*  Ooh, nah, I'm not doing it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1353.24s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1355.0400000000002s)]
*  You can't have it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1356.2s)]
*  I think so. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1356.84s)]
*  If he's Bijan Barkley that level and everybody thinks that, and people think [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1358.72s)]
*  the Raiders are going to take him at six and they want to leapfrog him and get [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1365.08s)]
*  to four or five to take them. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1368.6s)]
*  That's the, that's the path. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1370.6399999999999s)]
*  Seems like pretty good ads for that. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1372.76s)]
*  That is a Raiders move. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1374.56s)]
*  That would be fun. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1376.3999999999999s)]
*  Get the hell out of there. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1378.48s)]
*  You, so you like that one. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1379.6799999999998s)]
*  Tom, would you permit that? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1381.84s)]
*  Did any of the, since we did the NFO over under pod and we, so we did the, uh, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1382.2s)]
*  sound, I did that and we told, we told house, yeah, here's the Niners price. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1389.8400000000001s)]
*  And you would have thought I told house Trump's about to do tariffs. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1395.92s)]
*  Assume all these short positions. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1402.56s)]
*  I haven't heard how six that excited about a wind total, probably my life. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1405.0800000000002s)]
*  No, it's down. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1410.0s)]
*  Oh, it's still standing up, but there's minus one 35 juice now. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1411.36s)]
*  And that's not still not a bad price. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1414.84s)]
*  I held, you know, I caught my breath and I thought about it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1417.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1421.1200000000001s)]
*  And I don't think they're very good. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1421.4s)]
*  And I think they're going to have with this huge overhaul. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1422.92s)]
*  It's not going to be the same thing we're looking at and everything. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1425.44s)]
*  But I thought about it and I was like, and I still don't think they should be [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1427.88s)]
*  favored when the division, but I said, boy, if you had your choice of being in [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1431.4s)]
*  any division with any schedule, you would want to play a fourth place schedule. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1436.64s)]
*  And against the AFC South and the NFC South. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1441.36s)]
*  And that's what the national they're doing. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1444.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1445.6s)]
*  They do have the easiest schedule. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1446.04s)]
*  As we sit here today, we haven't seen what the rest situation and all that [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1447.56s)]
*  is and how it will affect it, but I don't know who's on that team. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1451.52s)]
*  I don't know what the skill positions are. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1456.56s)]
*  You took everybody from their team. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1458.48s)]
*  It's Brock Purdy and it's Trent Williams and it's a McCaffrey on how many, on, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1461.08s)]
*  on half a leg on one leg, I mean, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1466.52s)]
*  one leg. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1469.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1470.2s)]
*  Does he even have one leg in work? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1470.52s)]
*  It's Fred Warner plays defense. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1472.0s)]
*  They, you know, that's it. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1474.6s)]
*  We're going to do some master stuff before we do the draft. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1476.12s)]
*  We're going to do, um, we have a bunch of ringer specials that are on the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1480.6s)]
*  Fandel sports book right now, including houses, frog frenzy, region parlay, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  which is Matt Siyama, top Asian and McElroy top UK plus four 60. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1492.68s)]
*  Those guys, the frog frenzy house, because those guys are teammates. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1499.76s)]
*  They're teammates on the Boston common, uh, TGL team, the ball frogs. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1503.6s)]
*  And, uh, you might be the only person that knows this. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1510.12s)]
*  And that key, that key, I think played in like half a month. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1512.92s)]
*  I don't, I don't remember seeing him. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1516.12s)]
*  So we're very good explanation on so many different ways. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1517.64s)]
*  Frog frenzy. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1521.16s)]
*  I, that's it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1522.56s)]
*  I thought you were going to get canceled for a second. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1523.36s)]
*  I thought something horrible happened. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1525.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1527.4s)]
*  We keep it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1527.92s)]
*  Why did he? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1528.4s)]
*  I explained it when, when I put it in there, anytime you have the ball [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1529.1999999999998s)]
*  frogs as a potential parlay, you got to do it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1533.48s)]
*  So how's you have Justin Thomas winning the masters? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1536.3999999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1540.28s)]
*  What's the case? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1541.76s)]
*  Um, in the first place, 22 to one. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1542.84s)]
*  So that's the most important aspect of this. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1546.36s)]
*  I think it's a great price for where he is in terms of, um, his success this year. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1549.1599999999999s)]
*  His biggest problem over this drought, this winning drought that he's in, he [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1556.48s)]
*  hasn't won in over two years has been putting, he putted very poorly last season. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1560.8s)]
*  And his putting has greatly improved and his numbers he's been competitive. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1567.48s)]
*  I mean, he, he choked down the stretch, uh, two weeks ago in Tampa, Florida, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1571.2s)]
*  he had a three stroke lead going into the final five holes and lost to Victor [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1576.2s)]
*  Hovland who birdied two of the last three. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1581.04s)]
*  I mean, it was, it was a sensible loss, but I love where JT is in terms [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  of his off the T numbers. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1588.12s)]
*  I love where he is in terms of approach. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1590.28s)]
*  And the key thing for me is the price because I don't think you're getting [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1592.8799999999999s)]
*  any return on Scotty Scheffler or Roy McElroy, and I will pivot immediately [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  if one of those guys comes out and shoots 66 on Thursday, but JT at 22 to one [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1601.32s)]
*  doesn't match up with the caliber and quality of his play thus far this season. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1607.6799999999998s)]
*  So that's why I did it. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1611.24s)]
*  And then Sal, you jumped on. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1612.8s)]
*  Morikawa. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1614.8s)]
*  A bandwagon. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1615.6799999999998s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1617.08s)]
*  He's a bandwagon. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  I haven't heard anyone else take them. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1618.6399999999999s)]
*  Bandwagon pick. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1619.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, so many people. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1620.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1621.6s)]
*  16 to one on Fandor. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1622.08s)]
*  What was your case? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1623.72s)]
*  Fourth in the world. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1624.2s)]
*  Came in third last year. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1625.72s)]
*  Came in 10th the year before, came in fifth in 2022. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1627.8s)]
*  He's never missed a master's cut. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1631.84s)]
*  So, you know, you're going to see him Saturday, Sunday. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1633.44s)]
*  He's going to be on the board. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1635.6799999999998s)]
*  I think people are down on him because of that outburst with house. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1636.8799999999999s)]
*  You say that's not even an outburst. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1640.28s)]
*  No. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1641.84s)]
*  Blew a three stroke lead with five left in the Arnold Palmer last month. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1642.32s)]
*  And he wouldn't talk to the press. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1646.6399999999999s)]
*  He gives a crap. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1647.84s)]
*  Don't talk to me. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1648.9199999999998s)]
*  I'll talk to you when I win here. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1649.72s)]
*  He didn't talk to the press because he was waiting for the winner to finish and he was [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1651.6s)]
*  waiting and he was waiting and he was waiting and the tour never got him said, come, you [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1655.0s)]
*  know, here's how we're going to sequence this. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1659.12s)]
*  He just left. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1661.28s)]
*  Very misunderstood. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1661.9199999999998s)]
*  He signed all these autographs. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1662.32s)]
*  Tour apologists, Joe Hess. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1663.1599999999999s)]
*  I like, I'm a Morikawa stan. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1664.9199999999998s)]
*  He finished in ties the top 20 in all four majors last year. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1666.56s)]
*  I think he's a great bet. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1669.52s)]
*  I have some more cow exposure. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1671.24s)]
*  I just love the price for JT. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1673.84s)]
*  That's the reason that I went with JT. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1675.3999999999999s)]
*  We did hit one bet already. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1677.72s)]
*  What's the masters that we'd run in the Scott van Pelt and he would take us to the [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1679.6799999999998s)]
*  Butler cabin and we would get a group photo. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1684.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1686.24s)]
*  Which I put on my Instagram. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1686.6399999999999s)]
*  That was, that was like the Butler cabin. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1687.9199999999998s)]
*  I haven't seen how static cited probably. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1690.48s)]
*  I I'm trying to think of a scenario where you would have the look on your face. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1694.52s)]
*  So you had, and I think it involves the word free massage. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1697.72s)]
*  I won't go there. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1700.96s)]
*  It was stunning. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1701.92s)]
*  I'm not, I can't overstate how like the set of the sequence of events. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  First of all, we walked all the way up 10 to get to the top of the hill to where [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1708.44s)]
*  they're all the social scene is happening. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1714.4s)]
*  The media people, all that happens at the putting green or where one and 10 come [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1716.0s)]
*  together. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1721.48s)]
*  It's a scene kudos to Nathan Hubbard who's asleep right now because he had 14 [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1721.88s)]
*  pieces of pizza. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1726.0s)]
*  Um, but he, he was like, let's go up there. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1727.36s)]
*  We'll run into someone. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1729.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a good call. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1731.1599999999999s)]
*  It was a great call. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1731.9199999999998s)]
*  We'll run into somebody. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1732.44s)]
*  But we, we had to stop halfway up because the cousin Sal has never walked up 10. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1733.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1737.6s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1738.44s)]
*  It's a real walk. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1739.12s)]
*  Forgot. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1740.24s)]
*  It was like the Denver nuggets bench with all the rookies. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1740.8s)]
*  We forgot that Sal was a rookie and didn't realize we're just going up hill for [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1743.52s)]
*  an hour. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1747.32s)]
*  Ridiculous walker by eating pizza and oysters. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1747.76s)]
*  That's how I dream. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1751.2s)]
*  But we went, the sequence of events went from, from that moment. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1751.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1755.24s)]
*  And then we're up there and then like, Hey, but you know, there's SB baby doll [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1755.6s)]
*  takes charge. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1760.36s)]
*  It goes, he knows me. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1761.28s)]
*  He knows me. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1763.04s)]

*  But cool brick fireplace. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1779.7199999999998s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1781.36s)]
*  It's a really, it's a TV studio. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1782.0s)]
*  It is completely like, you know, floor to ceiling outfit for perfect, um, TV, you [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1784.2s)]
*  know, for video audio. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a, it's like walking into, you know, any, a proper studio where you guys know [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1791.9199999999998s)]
*  how to do TV shows. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1797.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1799.36s)]
*  I was surprised by that aspect. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1799.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1801.12s)]
*  It's like there'd be a ringer studio right outside small world ride and [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1801.2s)]
*  Disneyland. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1805.12s)]
*  It's like, what the, why is this here? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1805.6399999999999s)]
*  It's also always fun to run into being pelt cause he's gigantic. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1807.32s)]
*  He's so tall. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1810.08s)]
*  It's like six, five. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1810.72s)]
*  You always forget how like tall he is. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1811.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1813.28s)]
*  And just famous. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1813.56s)]
*  What a homie. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1814.56s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1815.44s)]
*  Um, my master's winner is Rory McElroy at plus six 50. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1816.1599999999999s)]
*  It's it's, I always make fun of you for being sentimental about Rory. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1821.8799999999999s)]
*  We do. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1825.12s)]
*  Um, what, uh, somebody that, uh, drove us around a little bit the last two days, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1825.96s)]
*  Matt, who we've been fortunate enough to get to know a little bit. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1832.1599999999999s)]
*  And he had some Rory Intel about Rory was kind of popping back here and play the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1835.6799999999998s)]
*  course and, um, just making a couple of extra trips. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1840.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1844.56s)]
*  Gus, the native Matt, keeping his eye on things for us. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1844.72s)]
*  Just that Rory seemed to especially focus this year. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1847.8s)]
*  And I just liked the moment. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1851.24s)]
*  I mean, he's running out of time, you know, from, uh, from, uh, he's in an X, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1853.0s)]
*  his extended prime now, I would say. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1859.28s)]
*  I don't think there's a lot more years where he's in the mix like this as a [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1861.48s)]
*  favorite and it just feels like to me, like, if it's going to happen, it's [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1864.9599999999998s)]
*  going to be like, gotta be like this year. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1868.56s)]
*  Or next year. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1870.9599999999998s)]
*  So that's interesting because we are in this era where we see athletes, you [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1872.0s)]
*  know, extend their career and he has been very fortunate in terms of avoiding injury. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1877.0s)]
*  He does seem like with his swing, he's been able to get more out of it. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1882.52s)]
*  He hits the ball even further than ever in his thirties and he doesn't have [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1886.1999999999998s)]
*  these injuries that pop up that much. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1890.8s)]
*  Um, so I think there's a window of time that I would say it's at least like five [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1893.28s)]
*  years, um, but your point is right. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1897.12s)]
*  There is not a long history of masters winners, you know, once you hit age 35, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1899.4s)]
*  if he could avoid injury, like he avoided baby doll today. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1904.88s)]
*  So 35, four years left. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1908.16s)]
*  I would give him like six or seven. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1911.4s)]
*  I mean, remember when we get in our forties, are we still in your [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1913.1200000000001s)]
*  prime at this point in golf? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1915.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, so basically he's got the 20, 20, 19. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1918.8400000000001s)]
*  He's got some time. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1922.88s)]
*  I'm not ready. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1923.88s)]
*  It's just that this is the moment though. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1924.8000000000002s)]
*  This is a, a crucial moment. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1926.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not going to be any better because he's never come into a masters, having [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1929.08s)]
*  one twice on American soil and his numbers are through the roof in terms of [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1932.52s)]
*  the quality of his. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1937.24s)]
*  Look in our defense house and I bet golf every weekend and we've had money on [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1938.3999999999999s)]
*  Rory blowing round four a lot, right? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1942.04s)]
*  I mean, I just, that's the hesitation. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1944.72s)]
*  That's 36 years old. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1946.6399999999999s)]
*  We're yeah. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1948.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1949.1599999999999s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1950.04s)]
*  We're, we're around when it should happen again. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1951.6s)]
*  Pretty soon. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1955.08s)]
*  It would be great. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1955.48s)]
*  I'm rooting for it. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1956.1999999999998s)]
*  I just didn't, I'll live bet it. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1957.72s)]
*  If he, if he comes out, his biggest problem has been Thursday. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1959.6000000000001s)]
*  He has played, scored well on Thursday. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1963.44s)]
*  Is he the number one player or a team you've live bet the most? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1965.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1970.2s)]
*  That's a, that's so I think for South the chiefs, uh, it might be Alex Pereira, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1971.8000000000002s)]
*  but it's funny. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1977.3200000000002s)]
*  We discussed this on against all odds. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1977.92s)]
*  Like if you had to assign a point value from one to a hundred on guys and teams [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1979.64s)]
*  that you've, you bet on the most. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1984.1200000000001s)]
*  So Pereira, McElroy, chestnut, my three, I think minor the Brady pats. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1985.8s)]
*  Oh, that's a good half time bet stuff like that. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1992.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=1995.3999999999999s)]

*  Now he's leaning on his left side. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2080.04s)]
*  But I just want to make you as uncomfortable as possible. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2084.6s)]
*  And he's also like cooking like a wild man with this really bad shoulder. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2084.96s)]
*  It's impressive. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's playing hurt. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2090.64s)]
*  Uh, he's an inspiration to all of us and to everybody except Tiger Woods. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2092.52s)]
*  He's not here, but there's a lot of good golfers here. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2096.8799999999997s)]
*  Nathan, we didn't talk about, uh, we both picked Roy to win this, uh, masters. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2099.6s)]
*  What was your case quickly? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2104.4s)]
*  Uh, he 10 years ago got 60% of his shots gained from off the T last year, 51%. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2105.96s)]
*  This year only 37% and he is still first in driving, which is to say the rest of [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2114.44s)]
*  his game has gotten way, way better. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2119.2000000000003s)]
*  See, that was much better and much smarter and more stat driven than my take, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2121.6800000000003s)]
*  which is like more, Roy's now hitting his. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2125.44s)]
*  It's mid late thirties. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2128.44s)]
*  It's time. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2129.7200000000003s)]
*  If it's ever going to happen, it's happening right now. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2130.6400000000003s)]
*  And Matt, our guy told us that he's been here a couple of times. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2132.6800000000003s)]
*  That was my case. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2135.32s)]
*  Plus six 50. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2136.48s)]
*  We're new draft. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2137.4s)]
*  You didn't trust Matt with your, your phone, but you do with the masters pick, huh? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  No, I wanted to put my phone. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2142.6400000000003s)]
*  I like getting my phone. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2144.1600000000003s)]
*  We all left our phones with Matt, but I don't know where Matt's going to go. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2145.1600000000003s)]
*  What if his car gets stolen? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2148.28s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2149.8s)]
*  We're doing this draft and Fandel is going to put odds on it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  And, uh, we are going to do a Thursday, Friday draft, the 48 hour [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2154.68s)]
*  frenzy, I think we're calling this. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2158.7200000000003s)]
*  Each of us are going to be two golfers lowest score wins and people can bet on [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2160.92s)]
*  this on Fandel sports book. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2166.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2167.32s)]
*  So if you like my pair more than everyone else's pair, put some odds on it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2167.56s)]
*  Um, how's your number Mike? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2172.08s)]
*  You can't talk. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2175.32s)]
*  You, you talk when I talk to you. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2176.28s)]
*  You sound like Alec Baldwin's wife. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2180.28s)]
*  You're sharing baby's Mike. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2181.88s)]
*  If you want, do you want to share, you have something to say? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2183.08s)]
*  No, just a typically very good show. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2186.6s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2190.16s)]
*  Can I just say we haven't figured out what the booby prize is, but whoever comes [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2190.48s)]
*  in last has to do something, uh, stupid, something humiliating Friday. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2194.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2199.16s)]
*  I think you have to mix all of the sandwiches and the, and the course [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2199.48s)]
*  that's pretty good and eat them. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2203.2s)]
*  Egg salad, pork idea. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2204.84s)]
*  I think I might've done that anyway today, but that's fine. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2206.7599999999998s)]
*  Dude. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2210.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2213.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's do the draft and then we're going to interrogate baby on some stuff. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2213.96s)]
*  Chang, I'm going to give you the first pick, um, of anyone for Thursday, Friday. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2217.36s)]
*  So it's not to win the tournament. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2222.7999999999997s)]
*  Just who do you think is going to be the leader Thursday and Friday, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2224.12s)]
*  or have a really good score? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2228.4s)]
*  Well, I know you guys are choosing, choosing Rory, uh, but I'm going to go [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2230.16s)]
*  with Scotty Schaffler, number one pick. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2233.32s)]
*  I don't, I don't think he's going to win, but for the first. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2235.32s)]
*  You know, two days. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2239.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2240.28s)]
*  That's my pick. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2241.0800000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2243.1200000000003s)]
*  Make a case for Shep. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2244.5200000000004s)]
*  Why don't say, where's this guy coming from? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2245.5600000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2249.1200000000003s)]
*  That's good. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2249.4s)]
*  And it's the lowest combined score, right? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2249.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2251.6000000000004s)]
*  So you have second pick. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2251.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2253.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, I did, you know, the last half hour I said, columnar cow. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2253.48s)]
*  I've not wavered from that pick. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2256.92s)]
*  I like them. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2258.6800000000003s)]
*  What are his numbers? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2259.5200000000004s)]
*  Uh, third last year, 10th year before fifth in 2022 never misses a master's cut. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2260.96s)]
*  We had a buddy who said he had lunch with them yesterday. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2266.32s)]
*  Delightful fella. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2269.88s)]
*  Dead said, I'm winning this thing. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2271.12s)]
*  Welcome to team Sal. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2273.16s)]
*  Is that like a name drop? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2274.8s)]
*  But it was like a mystery name. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2275.96s)]
*  Oh, it's a mystery name drop. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2277.48s)]
*  All right, Nathan, you go third. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2279.04s)]
*  Uh, give me Rory McElroy. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2280.7200000000003s)]
*  It's his time. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2284.44s)]
*  It's his time. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2287.0s)]
*  That's, that was my terrible take. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2287.52s)]
*  It's a bad take because Rory has struggled on Thursday. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2289.12s)]
*  And that's really the narrative of this tournament. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2292.8s)]
*  If he plays Thursday well, he's going to win this golf. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2294.48s)]
*  Thursday and Friday. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2298.2s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2299.96s)]
*  Um, baby, you get to go forth. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2300.84s)]
*  Who's your pick? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2303.12s)]
*  I'm doing the sweet. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2304.08s)]
*  Aberg Ludwig Ludwig. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2306.72s)]
*  Aberg. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2309.04s)]
*  It's kind of old burgers. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2310.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's over. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2311.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2312.04s)]
*  Let's let me know. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2312.4s)]
*  I don't think if he wins, you shouldn't get caught for that. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2313.2s)]
*  Wait, it's freaking Swedish. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2316.08s)]
*  Oh, Burger. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2318.0s)]
*  Definitely over. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2318.84s)]
*  Tato. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2319.72s)]
*  Tato gives a shit. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2320.12s)]
*  It starts with an A with that little dot over it. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2321.44s)]
*  When I'm supposed to follow this and all out. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2324.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2327.6s)]
*  I am a, I'm going fifth and I'm taking beefy Bryson, Bryson DeChamber with my fifth pick. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2328.16s)]
*  All right, house. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2335.64s)]
*  You get to hold the mic down. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2336.16s)]
*  You get two straight picks. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2337.24s)]
*  Great. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2338.8s)]
*  I'll take John Rom and I'll take Justin Thomas. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2339.16s)]
*  You got the best spot in the draft. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2344.8s)]
*  What? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2346.24s)]
*  Want to make a case? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2346.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2347.52s)]
*  John Rom is a complete wild card because he plays on the live tour. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2349.08s)]
*  Now he hasn't finished worse than six than any of his live events for the most part. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2353.4s)]
*  But I like him this year as opposed to last year. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2358.12s)]
*  He had a tide for 45th last year as the defending champion and he was in disarray. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2360.84s)]
*  His game was in disarray. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2365.52s)]
*  His life was in disarray. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2366.48s)]
*  I, he's calm now. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2367.44s)]
*  Nathan gave me a very fine report of how he conducted himself at the press conference. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2368.72s)]
*  He is poised. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2373.92s)]
*  He's ready. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  He's locked in. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2375.32s)]
*  I like that he played Doral last week. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2376.4399999999996s)]
*  Tough golf course played well, you know, let ready for a major. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  And then Justin Thomas might pick to win this golf tournament because I love the [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2382.0s)]
*  odds of 22 to one, but Thomas has been gaining strokes on approach for about nine [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2385.08s)]
*  months now and the key with Justin Thomas is that his putting is greatly improved. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2390.2799999999997s)]
*  Now he is playing with a new caddy for the masters. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2394.6s)]
*  Uh, I hope it's the guy that Ben Crenshaw used. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2399.64s)]
*  Uh, we're on the 30th anniversary of Brendan Crenshaw winning in 95. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2402.3999999999996s)]
*  He has that guy. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2405.56s)]
*  Um, you might have a chance, but I don't love the idea of a new caddy. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2406.8s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2409.84s)]
*  Why did people not like a new caddy? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2410.36s)]
*  Everybody gets the sours on a player who has a new caddy. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2412.12s)]
*  I think he changed doctors. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2415.0s)]
*  But, oh yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2417.56s)]
*  Crenshaw's caddy. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2419.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2420.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2420.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2421.28s)]
*  Pete. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2421.6s)]
*  Well, then he had to change caddies. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2422.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2424.0s)]
*  I'm up. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2424.36s)]
*  I'm taking Xander. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2424.88s)]
*  God. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2426.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2427.2000000000003s)]
*  Steady pick. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2427.8s)]
*  Best guy on the board. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2428.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2429.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, big year last year for him, maybe it'll continue at the masters. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2430.08s)]
*  So how says Ron and Thomas? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2433.7999999999997s)]
*  I have beefy Bryson and Xander as my two baby. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2435.92s)]
*  You're up. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2438.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm, I'm going with the say it right. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2440.52s)]
*  Always. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2444.6s)]
*  No, this one's easy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2445.24s)]
*  I'm going with Capca as my second pick. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2446.44s)]
*  Aberg played so in all Berg played so impressively last year, both of them [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2450.2799999999997s)]
*  played so burgee, just call him burgee, burgee Ludwig. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2456.6s)]
*  He hits the ball country mile. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2461.12s)]
*  Number one, he's got the short game. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2463.48s)]
*  He finished, I believe second last year, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2466.3999999999996s)]
*  And I think he's one of the absolute future stars of the tour and will [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2469.72s)]
*  win many majors in his career. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2474.9599999999996s)]
*  Capca. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2477.08s)]
*  I listen, I love on this podcast when people suck up to the Swedes. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2478.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2483.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2483.2s)]
*  In general, he's doing a great job threat in the majors. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2483.4399999999996s)]
*  He's doing a great job threat in the majors. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2487.7599999999998s)]
*  He's had a very good recent history kept in the masters. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2490.72s)]
*  I am not sure where his game is because I don't watch live, but I feel like [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2496.52s)]
*  he's always looming and, uh, could be a threat this, this week. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2503.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2509.24s)]
*  We got a lot of lib guys already. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2509.52s)]
*  That was two. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2510.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2512.16s)]
*  Uh, Nathan, you're up. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2512.64s)]
*  You have Rory and who? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2513.92s)]
*  God. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2515.8s)]
*  This is a tough one because the money says you should take Joaquin Nieman here, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2516.84s)]
*  but I just don't trust him based on the way that he played at live last week. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2521.72s)]
*  So I'm going to go totally off reservation and go Shane Lowry. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2526.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a small select group of guys who can actually win this golf tournament. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2532.56s)]
*  And it's people who come in with great ball striking and Shane Lowry is coming [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2536.12s)]
*  in with great ball striking and he generally starts these [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2539.92s)]
*  tournaments decently well. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2543.32s)]
*  So let's, let's see how he does. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2544.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2546.36s)]
*  Speaking of great ball striking cousins. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2546.64s)]
*  Hey now I'm going with the shaggy dog cam Smith, taking them right there. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2549.44s)]
*  Ninth last year, top 10, top 10 in five of the last seven masters and never [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2554.6s)]
*  missed a master's cut, which means he's going to have a nice score on Friday [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2560.68s)]
*  by Friday and, and he shaved the mullet. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2564.84s)]
*  He shaved the mullet that worries me. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2568.72s)]
*  Mullet or not. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2570.64s)]
*  Here we come. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2571.76s)]
*  Welcome to team South and Smith. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2572.8s)]
*  Dave Chang. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2574.84s)]
*  You have the last pick. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2576.48s)]
*  Um, I asked our good friend, Chad GPT to help me on this. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2578.08s)]
*  And I asked, what if you were cousin south, but successful at betting, at [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2585.36s)]
*  betting, especially when it comes to the masters and what would be the best long [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2591.88s)]
*  shot I sort of did. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2595.84s)]
*  And it also helped me with a alliteration. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2598.72s)]
*  So we got Scotty Scheffler and we're going to step Strakka. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2600.96s)]
*  We finished 16th last year. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2605.36s)]
*  We saw him today. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2606.96s)]
*  Great approach shots. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2608.08s)]
*  He looked good. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2609.32s)]
*  And I'm trying to make cousin sound look good. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2610.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2612.44s)]
*  Good. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2612.8s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2613.12s)]
*  I mean, that might be tougher than actually winning. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2613.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2616.4s)]
*  So here's who we have Chang has Scotty and Strakka. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2616.76s)]

*  Ram and Thomas. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2654.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2655.8s)]
*  I think, I think house will have the most action, which makes house public, which [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2656.04s)]
*  means he's not going to win. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2659.44s)]
*  They're public. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2662.28s)]
*  So there we go. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2663.28s)]

*  Check it out. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2665.76s)]

*  What do you want to call it? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2669.4s)]
*  I think that's good. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2670.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2671.04s)]
*  And then we might do, we were talking about maybe something with the 16th hole [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2671.36s)]
*  number of people that's that hit the water. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=2675.4s)]

*  His pace is very brisk. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3013.4s)]
*  But he's talking about his golf game and everything. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3014.6s)]
*  And this would go for 40 minutes and then we'd get a break from baby. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3016.64s)]
*  Like, Oh, thank God. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3019.76s)]
*  We don't have to listen to the golf talk. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3020.8s)]
*  He'd go to the bathroom where you go to smoke somewhere, or he'd go to a fucking [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3022.24s)]
*  pro shop for the fourth time in a day. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3025.4799999999996s)]

*  And we're like, baby, definitely don't do that. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3089.08s)]
*  He's doing a practice round. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3092.12s)]
*  He's trying to figure out distances. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3093.48s)]
*  He's not going to acknowledge you. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3095.04s)]
*  He's like, no, no, no, I think I can get him. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3096.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3098.12s)]
*  So he's walking by eating a banana and what happens? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3098.56s)]
*  Cam Cam Wake Forest. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3102.52s)]
*  Wait. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3106.24s)]
*  Oh, I said first, I said, Cam, we're rooting for you. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3106.7599999999998s)]
*  Best of luck this week. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3111.64s)]
*  Didn't look up from peeling the banana. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3113.36s)]
*  And as I said, as I said, Wake Forest guy, Wake Forest connection. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3116.52s)]
*  He continued to peel the banana and stick it in his mouth and look the other way. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3122.36s)]
*  He'd seem like he paused for a split second. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3127.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3130.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3130.68s)]
*  But that was it. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3130.96s)]
*  He at least might have paused. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3132.24s)]
*  And then there was a follow up. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3133.0s)]
*  Well, so then there was another one that I thought was a better one. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3134.7599999999998s)]
*  So they're Roy McElroy. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3138.12s)]
*  Chang, how dubious were you of this? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3140.12s)]
*  When I did, he said I can get Roy to come over. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3143.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3146.52s)]
*  On the 18th, I can't express how I felt truly because I didn't know I'd feel [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3146.8799999999997s)]
*  embarrassment on that hole because you said you were going to do it and I didn't [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3153.08s)]
*  think you were going to do it with Cam, but you did. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3157.3999999999996s)]
*  And it was embarrassing, quite frankly, for you and us because we were there. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3159.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought I wasn't embarrassed at all. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3164.24s)]
*  He'd be lucky to know me. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3168.96s)]
*  So now I knew you weren't joking that you were really going to worry because you [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3170.2799999999997s)]
*  have had interactions. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3175.6s)]
*  I have had multiple interactions with him. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3176.72s)]
*  Not today. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3179.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to say we're neighbors at the Bears Club, but we're neighbors at [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3180.7999999999997s)]
*  the Bears Club. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3184.8399999999997s)]
*  So you position yourself a wonderful guy to me and very kind. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3186.12s)]
*  He's a gentleman. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3191.04s)]
*  Can we can we all that? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3191.8799999999997s)]
*  Can we unwind that for a second? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3193.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3194.6s)]
*  I don't want to say I'm neighbors with him at the Bears Club, but I'm neighbors [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3194.8399999999997s)]
*  with him at the Bears Club. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3198.04s)]
*  Yeah, because it sounds so ridiculous. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3198.96s)]
*  His house is so incredibly beautiful. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3200.88s)]
*  Does that mean you're neighbors with him at the Bears Club? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3203.44s)]
*  I mean, he's around the corner. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3205.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's only 80 houses. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3207.12s)]
*  Sounds like neighbor. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3209.3599999999997s)]
*  But that doesn't mean he knows you. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3210.92s)]
*  No, I didn't say he knows me well, but he knows he knows he doesn't know me well. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3213.04s)]
*  But when he sees me, he knows who I am. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3217.7999999999997s)]
*  How's that? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3219.56s)]
*  So that Bears Clubhouse, that was like the fourth Colbert extension. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3220.08s)]
*  Like when you try to when you try to sign the fees to the houses, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3224.48s)]
*  the Simmons wing, what do you complain about? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3229.84s)]
*  Cause it sells my outdoor grill. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3233.68s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3236.88s)]
*  That just means you're a shitty agent. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3237.92s)]
*  So who is he playing with? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3242.68s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3245.92s)]
*  Oh, amateur. I believe. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3246.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3248.32s)]
*  And he hits a bomb of a drive on 18. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3248.92s)]
*  And, you know, to Bill's credit, he got us to look at how narrow [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3251.44s)]
*  and how stressful it is to actually play 18. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3256.2000000000003s)]
*  The TV doesn't really do it just. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3258.76s)]
*  There's like five things you kind of have to see at the Masters. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3260.52s)]
*  And one of them is you have to stand behind the 18th T to see. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3263.16s)]
*  It was so how hard that is to just thread the needle with the amount of pressure [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3267.16s)]
*  that you might be facing on 18. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3271.48s)]
*  It's like it's easy to say. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3273.32s)]
*  No other. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3274.52s)]
*  It's like dead uphill. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3275.2000000000003s)]
*  Giant, giant trap. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3276.8s)]
*  Only really one spot to hit it and 19 things can go around. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3278.96s)]
*  Let's mention all the people lined up. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3282.48s)]
*  I feel like it's 18. Yeah. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3284.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And Roy bombs his drive right down the middle. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3286.6000000000004s)]
*  Three hundred plus. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3289.5600000000004s)]
*  And, you know, you say you're going to talk to Rory [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3291.2000000000003s)]
*  and you have like this prime spot as he's going to walk past. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3296.32s)]
*  Yes. And I had to turn my back to you. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3300.6400000000003s)]
*  We backed off and gave him a back. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3303.44s)]
*  Like it was like a yo mama fire. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3305.48s)]
*  Let me give you some space. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3307.44s)]
*  I just I just couldn't see this car crash. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3308.6s)]
*  So sad. You want to read it? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3312.4s)]
*  But baby said the other side of it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3313.64s)]
*  Imagine if he came over, how great that fucking moment would have been. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3315.76s)]
*  Right. But that had been cool. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3319.44s)]
*  But what did you say? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3320.76s)]
*  You said Rory, Rory, baby doll. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3321.88s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3325.08s)]
*  I was it was just three words. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3326.04s)]
*  It's exactly what happened. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3329.2s)]
*  And he heard real. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3330.8s)]
*  He didn't not only did he stop, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3331.96s)]
*  I think he sped up when he heard baby doll cracked a little smile. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3334.0s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe I'm imagining like, oh, this is my prison cellmate [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3338.04s)]
*  from 750. So you're helping just in my defense. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3342.52s)]
*  Yeah. He wins the players two weeks ago or three. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3346.12s)]
*  How many weeks ago is that? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3349.72s)]
*  Three weeks ago now. And you guys are neighbors. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3351.0s)]
*  And I saw him in the men's grill. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3353.04s)]
*  And I, of course, congratulated him profusely. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3356.12s)]
*  And like a thousand people, he was sitting with Shane Lowry at the table. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3359.36s)]
*  And I talked to him for a minute and, you know, did the baby doll thing. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3363.7599999999998s)]
*  And what is the baby dolphin? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3368.6s)]
*  I think we saw it today. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3370.4399999999996s)]
*  That is it. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3371.64s)]
*  He calls someone's name and they don't respond. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3374.12s)]
*  The baby doll. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3377.4399999999996s)]
*  I thought maybe it was my fresh in his mind. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3378.04s)]
*  So that's why I had a modicum of of of confidence [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3381.16s)]
*  that he was going to like, oh, baby doll. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3385.68s)]
*  OK, look, whatever didn't work out that way. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3388.64s)]
*  Well, well, as it turns out, these guys are practice [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3391.96s)]
*  rounding and yeah, trying to figure out their shots and the distances. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3394.84s)]
*  And you drive, you pick Rory, baby doll, didn't really trigger him at all. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3398.6s)]
*  When you have been a little weirded out, you picked Rory. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3402.28s)]
*  If he like was so unfocused that he did come over, I would have been concerned. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3404.48s)]
*  Or you like they're actually. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3407.76s)]
*  I know they're like he's played this tournament, you know, 20 times, 15 times. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3410.4s)]
*  It's loose out there in these practice rounds. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3416.6s)]
*  All right. So he just doesn't like you. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3418.84s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3420.08s)]
*  Oh, for two is the legacy. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3421.44s)]
*  I was over to South. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3423.52s)]
*  Can you tell the origin of these tomorrow? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3425.2s)]
*  Can you tell the origin of the baby doll story? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3428.0s)]
*  Because you named him baby doll. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3430.4s)]
*  I don't think there's much to it other than he says baby doll. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3431.7599999999998s)]
*  He calls everyone baby doll. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3434.7999999999997s)]
*  And I thought this was funny. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3436.48s)]
*  And then so I started calling him baby doll. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3439.04s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3441.4s)]
*  I mean, it's not fair that he gets to call everyone baby doll. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3442.4s)]
*  We don't call him back. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3445.04s)]
*  That was really it. There's not much. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3447.64s)]
*  You are the. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3449.0s)]
*  You are the guy who. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3451.64s)]
*  But to me, this is like, I don't know why no one did this. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3453.12s)]
*  I met him 25 years ago. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3457.36s)]
*  Someone should have done this 40 years ago. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3459.24s)]
*  This is like wheels on luggage, like luggage. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3461.4s)]
*  Oh, he should have had wheels, right? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3464.08s)]
*  Not 1978. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3466.16s)]
*  And I like that. I like that. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3468.68s)]
*  Thank you. Well, that's it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3470.36s)]
*  You should have been baby. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3471.92s)]
*  So you were hoping because everyone calls you baby doll and you call everybody baby doll. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3473.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3476.56s)]
*  Somewhere in Roy's head as he's figuring out the course, how his swing is, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3477.72s)]
*  the distance is that the baby doll would trigger like a Pavlovian response. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3483.24s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3487.52s)]
*  And he's like, oh, that guy I really like. Right. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3488.2s)]
*  Yeah, totally. Isn't that insane of me? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3490.2799999999997s)]
*  But yes, that was what was going to be the baby doll. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3492.56s)]
*  I thought mine I have to say upon reflection. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3494.7999999999997s)]
*  It's your performance that was inspirational. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3497.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, right. I love you, Chang. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3500.12s)]
*  Thank you. You have to try. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3502.3999999999996s)]
*  Failure is not enough. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3504.8399999999997s)]
*  You just got to try. You don't know what you're going to get. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3506.24s)]
*  And that's the baby doll magic is just not being afraid. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3508.52s)]
*  That's it. You got to. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3512.3599999999997s)]
*  Is that the Wayne Gretzky quote? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3513.8799999999997s)]
*  You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3516.0s)]
*  That's that's exactly it. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3519.0s)]
*  You know, and and I know he's a he's a really like decent guy when you when you talk to him. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3520.52s)]
*  He's a gentleman beyond belief. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3527.3599999999997s)]
*  And why should we believe you? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3529.2799999999997s)]
*  No, because he just is. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3530.56s)]
*  And and like he's not some, you know. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3532.24s)]
*  Disengaged guy, and he's he's always very polite and engaged. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3536.0s)]
*  So I thought maybe and it was relatively recent that we we bullshitted and [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3542.68s)]
*  over to then I say I try. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3550.24s)]
*  But that wasn't really the highlight. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3551.8799999999997s)]
*  Sort of the highlight for me was we were talking to a member of Augusta National and. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3553.24s)]
*  Somehow you just let it be known that you were a board member of Wake Forest right off the bat. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3559.2400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. Which had nothing to do with the conversation. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3565.0800000000004s)]
*  You were so proud of that. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3568.2400000000002s)]
*  Why did I bring? Well, because you brought up. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3569.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I'm like, you're right. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3573.1600000000003s)]
*  I did bring it up. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3574.96s)]
*  I had to add context to this, but we're talking about the LPGA and Wake Forest. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3576.28s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3580.5200000000004s)]
*  Thank you for the refresher. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3581.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. And I could. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3583.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes. And I could. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3584.72s)]
*  He was talking about the the ladies amateur being held at Augusta. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3585.88s)]
*  Which is picking up steam. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3591.72s)]
*  Which which I think one of the things I learned today is baby's very proud to be on the board of Wake Forest. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3592.92s)]
*  I am. It's an honor. It really is an amazing. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3598.64s)]
*  Weren't shy about you told the person who made us a pimento cheese sandwich about it. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3601.56s)]
*  Pretty much everybody. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3607.88s)]
*  I wonder what is it? Your grandkids, your family, Wake Forest board. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3609.24s)]
*  John Stewart and then way, way lower. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3614.32s)]
*  All of those other clients. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3616.84s)]
*  Okay, I'll go with that. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3618.6800000000003s)]
*  Not way down. Oh, yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3620.0800000000004s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3621.0800000000004s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3622.0800000000004s)]
*  But this Wake Forest thing shot to the top. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3626.56s)]
*  I mean, you remember when the bachelor Matt James was in there for that. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3628.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3632.48s)]
*  A year. That's the. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3633.32s)]
*  No, when he was like right there with Stewart. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3634.4s)]
*  Right. It's like neck and neck. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3636.1600000000003s)]
*  He was. You were dropping his name everywhere. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3637.76s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, hey, you're only the bachelor once. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3639.8s)]
*  Right. There's one more baby. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3642.6s)]
*  There's like so many babies. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3644.6s)]
*  It's only true joy getting to it's only been one day. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3646.6s)]
*  We're going to read it. It just is amazing. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3649.36s)]
*  It feels like days. What's this going to be? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3651.16s)]
*  So you disappeared quite often. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3653.2400000000002s)]
*  You got in trouble for smoking cigarettes. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3655.68s)]
*  That was also a highlight. OK, fair enough. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3657.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3659.76s)]
*  But the real highlight was you disappeared. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3660.84s)]
*  And I think amongst the five of us were like, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3663.92s)]
*  we're what's going on here? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3667.92s)]
*  Why are you not here? Right. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3669.8s)]
*  And you come back and we all had to sort of eat [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3671.48s)]
*  pro because you bought us all hats. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3673.44s)]
*  Yes, I did. And then it was worth the wait. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3675.08s)]
*  But a funny can you decide what happened? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3678.76s)]
*  Well, we had we waited like a half hour for. Yeah. Right. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3681.04s)]
*  And like what that we said, he needed a hat because the sun was hot. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3684.92s)]
*  And for some reason, he was scared about skin cancer for once. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3688.0s)]
*  Interesting. And decided to get a hat. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3691.2400000000002s)]
*  We wanted this. Is that what it was? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3692.92s)]
*  Yeah, because they didn't have it at the. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3695.08s)]
*  This was he was in the pro shop for like an hour and a half. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3697.2000000000003s)]
*  And then 40 minutes later has to shop even more. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3699.8s)]
*  Yes, I was like worse than my wife. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3703.0s)]
*  And then, yeah. So then he comes out and like, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3704.84s)]
*  Chang says he starts throwing it like gives us all hats. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3707.44s)]
*  He's like, yeah, take a hat. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3710.0s)]
*  You spend like two hundred fifty dollars on. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3711.32s)]
*  We're talking to some fans of bill. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3713.0400000000004s)]
*  This happening bills. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3715.96s)]

*  Colma. Yeah. Yes, I have smoked in there. Of course. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3796.4s)]
*  I used to go like say to myself, why don't they have this in America? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3801.2s)]

*  Yes, smoke chamber. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3808.52s)]
*  It's like they all have pet pet walking relief areas. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3810.08s)]
*  Why not have smoking? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3814.64s)]
*  Did you use to smoke like on airplanes, trains, everything? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3815.68s)]
*  Just going to ask. Absolutely. Really? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3818.72s)]
*  And the people did you ever like get in an argument with anybody? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3820.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, not really. No, because it was legal. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3823.8799999999997s)]
*  Legal. Can you imagine someone lighting up next to you on a plane? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3827.3599999999997s)]
*  Imagine sitting next to baby on a train. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3830.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, my God. You're taking like the Xcela from New York to Boston. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3832.3599999999997s)]
*  It's just like lighting up. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3835.48s)]
*  But those you're like, oh, this cologne, I can't take this for a while. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3836.7599999999998s)]
*  And what the fuck? What is this? A cigarette? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3839.96s)]
*  What is he doing to me? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3841.8399999999997s)]
*  Those were designated smoking sections. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3842.7599999999998s)]
*  So if you were all the planes, I don't even understand that. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3845.36s)]
*  Not the planes, but the trains. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3848.0s)]
*  If you were in a smoking car, you know, not my problem at that point. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3850.96s)]
*  Right. There are. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3854.84s)]
*  That was an amazing era where because I would take the train back and forth [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3855.8s)]
*  between my mom and my dad. Yeah. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3859.32s)]
*  And you're going to walk to the cafe car and you just walk through the smoking car. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3861.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's just like lung cancer for right. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3865.36s)]
*  Well, the end second were the planes where one row behind was not smoking. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3867.56s)]
*  Right. You could smoke pipes, cigars, cigarettes. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3872.44s)]
*  And if you want, I was like, you're just getting the actual ashtray in the arm. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3875.12s)]
*  Absolutely. I love that. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3879.92s)]
*  Frickin I love that ashtray. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3881.32s)]
*  I really did. They had them on the old cars, too. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3884.92s)]
*  Remember? But no, wait, you were asking me about most depressing smoking places. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3887.36s)]
*  Depressing. Yeah. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3893.84s)]
*  Well, because sometimes the smokers get relegated to the kids table of life. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3895.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's not fair. Yeah. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3900.76s)]
*  I'll tell you the the the idea that I could smoke in the office. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3902.0s)]
*  Up until like it wasn't even that one by nine. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3907.12s)]
*  By two in 2000, you could smoke in the office. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3911.44s)]
*  So 25 years ago, you could even as an assistant sitting in a cubicle in common areas. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3915.32s)]
*  And I used to run like a fan under my desk that just like spread the the the smoke. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3921.28s)]
*  But yeah, that was insane to think that you could do that. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3928.48s)]
*  Now in New York City, it's 25 feet away from the building. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3932.88s)]
*  So if you smoke near a building, you often get reprimanded. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3937.64s)]
*  You've paid a smoking fee in a rental car like 50 times. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3941.32s)]
*  Of course I have. And hotels. Good for you. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3944.6s)]
*  Baby gets offended if there's some sort of penalty for smoking a rental car. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3947.16s)]
*  He just assumes. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3951.52s)]
*  For the for the the percentage of how many rental cars I've had that I've smoked in [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3952.68s)]
*  and the times I've been nailed, I've done very, very well. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3958.64s)]
*  What was it like to have a cigarette that your wife probably should know about baby? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3962.36s)]
*  You know, every time I see baby, though, baby gives me a cigarette. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3966.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's just a joyous occasion. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3970.7999999999997s)]
*  I sucked that thing down and it was awesome. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3972.7999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. And you love that I have Marlboro Reds. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3975.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, listen, the only way you'd be cooler is if you smoke [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3978.36s)]
*  filterless cigarettes. Yeah. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3981.8s)]
*  What do you like? Yeah. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3983.4s)]

*  That's that's the problem with them. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3987.6400000000003s)]
*  Otherwise, I can't. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3989.2400000000002s)]
*  If baby's enough colors, you know, right? Exactly. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=3990.6000000000004s)]

*  Yes. Right. I hadn't seen that. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4044.96s)]
*  I'm not sure live would be the best idea. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4047.04s)]
*  But maybe just it would need about 16 or 17 hours. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4049.16s)]
*  So we watch it. But I think it would be good. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4053.68s)]

*  It's the courses and built for the tournament. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4541.12s)]
*  It's built for 52 weeks a year of having members. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4543.2s)]
*  And then they kind of shoehorn the tournament into it. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4547.04s)]
*  And there will be porta potties and weird cart pass and the parking's weird and things are disjointed. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4549.68s)]
*  All this place cares about is this week. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4556.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4559.2s)]
*  I mean, they have other stuff. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4559.5199999999995s)]
*  They have the members and all that stuff. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4560.64s)]
*  But it's all like a long game for this one. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4562.08s)]
*  We act it all. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4564.48s)]
*  Every single thing has to be perfect for the moment you show up to when you walk toward the thing. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4565.599999999999s)]
*  You go through the gates. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4570.08s)]
*  Every single thing you see, they've really put thought into. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4571.04s)]
*  And I just I appreciate that. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4574.4s)]
*  I think it was like a combination that has an immaculate feel of Disneyland and like Central Park. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4576.32s)]
*  And there's like you said, and I think it's because they're not different events moving in and out. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4582.32s)]
*  There's no wasted space. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4587.5199999999995s)]
*  Forget about the greens. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4588.8s)]
*  You turn a corner and you're going to see a shade of green you've never seen before. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4590.08s)]
*  That's great, too. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4593.36s)]
*  But even the pathways and everything like you're talking about, like it doesn't seem like there's any wasted space. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4594.32s)]
*  It's all beautiful. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4598.719999999999s)]
*  Well, and then we talked about this every time we come, but the no phone thing is actually a real advantage. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4599.679999999999s)]
*  Even Sal, we were worried about Sal. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4604.4s)]
*  I think I did OK. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4606.24s)]
*  Yeah, I had withdrawal for the first like you did. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4607.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I went to my pocket seven times. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4610.0s)]
*  Yeah, you really were like jonesing for that. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4612.16s)]
*  And then I felt like, you know, it was a little like a little white lotusy when Saxon starts reading halfway through the season. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4614.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4622.879999999999s)]
*  And it's like maybe there's more interesting. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4623.44s)]
*  Maybe that maybe it's funny. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4625.92s)]
*  Maybe I can test myself. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4627.28s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4628.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's like you were like, maybe I don't have to try to figure out how to bet on this practice round. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4629.36s)]
*  You're right. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4634.24s)]
*  To like just kind of like acclimate yourself to where you were. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4634.64s)]
*  And accept it and then go, OK, I'm it helped that we were all talking to each other, making each other laugh. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4639.44s)]
*  It's like when someone's sick and they're going to vomit, like, all right, if you talk to this person enough, they're not going to get mad at it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4644.8s)]
*  I don't have to focus on it. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4649.68s)]
*  But Chang, we disappointed Sal to need more. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4651.12s)]
*  What do you talk? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4653.44s)]
*  What number one on the course? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4654.16s)]
*  I mean, on the course. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4657.76s)]
*  But for those that don't know, Sal is not a big drinker. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4658.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4662.48s)]
*  And the fact that he started today with the Bloody Marys, like this is an auspicious sign. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4662.72s)]
*  It's going to be a good week. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4667.84s)]
*  Number one, too. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4669.52s)]
*  He ate a lot of food. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4671.280000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4673.04s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4673.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4674.56s)]
*  And then he hit the course. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4674.88s)]
*  You ate a pimento cheese sandwich and I knew you were full. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4676.88s)]
*  I knew you were disgustingly full. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4679.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4681.360000000001s)]
*  But you still waltzed down. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4681.68s)]
*  I was like, this guy is bringing you bringing your egg in there for 50. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4683.360000000001s)]
*  He's not wasting that. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4688.4800000000005s)]
*  People don't know the food here is amazing. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4689.76s)]
*  It's affordable. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4692.16s)]
*  You could buy 12 beers for twelve dollars. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4693.2s)]
*  We're going to do that anywhere else. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4695.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's only three thousand to get in. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4696.48s)]
*  But then they get for cheese and one, the bread they charge. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4698.0s)]
*  The master so different. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4700.639999999999s)]
*  Touch on what you said, Bill, which is, you know, it's the only obviously the only major [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4702.4s)]
*  that's always in the same location. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4707.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4709.28s)]
*  So that alone sets it apart from all the other majors. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4709.599999999999s)]
*  And like everyone's just so fucking happy to be there. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4713.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4718.24s)]
*  Because it is expensive and you have to, you know, get to it. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4718.639999999999s)]
*  And like it's it's a bucket list place that at least half those people, at least half [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4722.08s)]
*  are there for the first time. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4729.84s)]
*  And everybody's just like, holy shit, pinch me. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4731.36s)]
*  I did it. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4734.72s)]
*  Well, listen, I all I'll have to say is, as the great Terry Kuhn said in White Lotus, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4736.08s)]
*  I'm happy to have a seat at the table, but I am going to make a mess at that seat with [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4740.64s)]
*  bread and rice and cheese and everything else when I get up. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4745.12s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4749.44s)]
*  So South finishes last in the picks so that we can load down a good chance. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4750.32s)]
*  Mento pulled pork, egg salad, egg salad, chicken, biscuit, chicken, biscuit. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4757.84s)]
*  What else? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4763.84s)]
*  BLT. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4764.639999999999s)]
*  It's the Masters Club, which is like a BLT. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4765.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, that sounds great. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4767.76s)]
*  Now, I hope I finish last, too. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4768.8s)]
*  We put it that way. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4771.68s)]
*  We're going to be back Thursday for more stuff. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4773.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4776.639999999999s)]

*  So you have a beautiful life. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bY-PU2OSrw&t=4778.96s)]
