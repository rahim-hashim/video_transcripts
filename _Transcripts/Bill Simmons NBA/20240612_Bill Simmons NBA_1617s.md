# Six Major Things Going On in Sports With Bill Simmons | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY)
*  Brought to you by Michelob Ultra, which is the official beer sponsor of the NBA. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=0.0s)]
*  My favorite sport. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=7.32s)]
*  Win or lose, you're bound to enjoy the ride with a good beer in hand and Michelob Ultra [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=8.32s)]
*  is good beer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=11.64s)]
*  It's crisp, it's light, it's refreshing, only 95 calories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=12.64s)]
*  So order yourself an ultra six pack while we unpack six major things going on in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=15.92s)]
*  world of basketball and in sports. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=20.28s)]
*  Right now I'm going to start with the NBA finals. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=23.0s)]
*  You think I'm going to start with Porzingis, and I'm not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=24.64s)]
*  We're going to talk about Porzingis later with Chris Mannix. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=27.6s)]
*  I'm going to start with the concept of identity because the Celtics who were like [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=31.0s)]
*  minus two 20 to win the finals heading into the finals against Dallas, even though [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=37.24s)]
*  the matchups were super favorable for them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=41.52s)]
*  And if you watch the first two games, they won both games, even though they shot the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=43.56s)]
*  ball terribly in game two and they just look like they're a better team. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=47.84s)]
*  Now with Porzingis, maybe that'll leave it in now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=51.6s)]
*  But people had an issue picking them to win the finals. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=54.279999999999994s)]
*  And a lot of, especially national media people gravitated toward Luka because the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=57.64s)]
*  Luka framework made sense. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=64.0s)]
*  It's a star. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=64.36s)]
*  Stars win finals. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=65.24s)]
*  Best player in the series usually wins the finals. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=66.44s)]
*  But really having the best player in a series is an identity thing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=69.72s)]
*  And I was thinking about sometimes there's years where the identity of a team is the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  star, not the actual star. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=78.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=80.72s)]
*  So going backwards, this is, I did everything before the merger. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=81.04s)]
*  I was looking at this, the 1979 Seattle Sonics during the stretch when Bill Walton [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=84.12s)]
*  should have won four straight titles and he didn't, but they didn't really totally [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  have a best player like Dennis Johnson won finals MVP, but really their guards were [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  the star was Gus Williams and Dennis Johnson. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  And they had size. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=99.92s)]
*  So they had things that made sense, but they didn't make sense in the traditional. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  We have a big star sense. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=104.84s)]
*  Then you go to the 1989 Pistons. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=106.76s)]
*  Isaiah is clearly the best player on the team, but that wasn't a star driven title [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=108.72s)]
*  either because that's one of the best defensive teams of all time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=113.28s)]
*  And that team was like a Swiss army. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=115.92s)]
*  And if they go big, they could go small. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=117.28s)]
*  That was their identity. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=119.48s)]
*  That's why they were in the title 2004 Detroit. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=120.52s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=123.28s)]
*  Defense top five guys play perfectly together. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=124.32s)]
*  And, you know, we weren't in 2004, like with Tatum and Brown, you know, Jason kid [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=128.08s)]
*  tries to nudge that whole thing before game two. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=133.96s)]
*  And it's like, I think Jaylen Brown's the best part of the team. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=137.2s)]
*  Everybody gets all fired up about, oh my God, look at the head games. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=139.44s)]
*  Well, wait, is Jaylen Brown the best part of the team? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=143.28s)]
*  And the point is it doesn't matter because the 2004 Pistons, we didn't know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  their best player was, I still don't really know probably if I had to pick Ben [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=151.6s)]
*  Wallace that year was probably their best player, but ultimately it didn't matter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  And you know what we weren't doing in 2004, having arguments about who is the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=159.92s)]
*  best part in the Pistons over. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=163.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=165.64s)]
*  Look at the Pistons. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=166.0s)]
*  They're killing the Lakers right now, which is what they did. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=166.72s)]
*  So this is a relatively modern thing where we have to argue about this stuff. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=169.56s)]
*  2006 Miami. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=172.72s)]
*  That was a more fun argument because Shaq was still the best center in the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=174.32s)]
*  league, but it was becoming Wade's team. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=177.28s)]
*  And then in the finals, Wade just grabbed the car keys and he grabbed the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=179.64s)]
*  steering wheel and he's like, I'm going to take us home guys. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=183.96s)]
*  And he was clearly their best player by the end of the finals, but we didn't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=186.68s)]
*  know that heading into the finals. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=189.56s)]
*  2008 Celtics always had a Pierce or Garnett thing where Garnett was the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=191.88s)]
*  best player in the team. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  Pierce beat LeBron in a game seven, younger LeBron, but still, and went toe [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=199.48s)]
*  to toe with Kobe in the finals and was a better player and won the finals MVP. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=206.16s)]
*  I think KG was the best player in that team. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  The point is, and you, by the way, could have made a case, Ray Allen could have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=213.48s)]
*  won finals MVP, but nobody really cared. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=216.6s)]
*  The point was they were awesome regular season, awesome team, and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=220.24s)]
*  they won the whole thing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=224.12s)]
*  It was the identity of the big three. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=224.8s)]
*  The fact that they could play big, they could play small. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  They were deep and that was, that was what it was. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=229.44s)]
*  2009 Lakers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  We argued that whole year about power Kobe, who's their best player. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=234.44s)]
*  And I honestly, I still don't know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=237.84s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=240.68s)]
*  I just want to make sure the Laker fans are still listening. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=241.8s)]
*  Kobe was the best player. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=243.8s)]
*  They don't qualify for this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=244.68s)]
*  2014 Spurs is a great one because that's old Duncan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=245.84s)]
*  Duncan was their best player. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=251.0s)]
*  And in 2013, I still feel like he was, even though Parker kind of was. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=252.44s)]
*  2014, you know, Kawhi won finals MVP, but Kawhi Parker, older Tim Duncan, really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=257.12s)]
*  he could have made a case for anybody. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=264.12s)]
*  The real reason they won was their offense was just beautiful, the movement. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=265.36s)]
*  And they had the perfect guy to guard LeBron in a season where that team, you [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=268.84s)]
*  know, was, was that Miami team was kind of fading and becoming a different thing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=274.08s)]
*  And then you look at 2024, if it is the Celtics, they'll win the title. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=278.24s)]
*  What's the identity of the team? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=282.4s)]
*  And so who's the best player? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=283.68s)]
*  The identity is the Jays. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  It's Jason Tatum and Jalen Brown together. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=287.56s)]
*  That's if you're going to compare them to some of these other teams, that's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=289.56s)]
*  their identity, it's having those two guys. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=292.64s)]
*  And then on top of it, having this incredible high end depth with holiday, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  with poor Zingas, with Derek White, even with Horford as a sixth man. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=301.04s)]
*  And they probably have five of the top 50 guys in the league, plus [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=306.32s)]
*  Horford, plus some shooting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=309.8s)]
*  And that's why if they win, that's why they're going to win. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  And the point is it doesn't really matter who the best player was. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=314.92s)]
*  This is stuff for people like me to talk about and get talk segments out of, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=317.72s)]
*  oh, who's the best player? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=322.16s)]
*  So they coming up on first take. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=323.04s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=325.6s)]
*  Winning the title is what matters. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  And if they win, it's because of the Jays. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=327.88s)]
*  So that's their identity and that's all we should be talking about. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=329.2s)]
*  That's my first thing for the six pack. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=332.44s)]
*  Second one is a little NBA related. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=336.08s)]
*  Um, and it's a quickie, but you know, Warner feels like they've blown the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=338.84s)]
*  basketball package, which I've been telling you now for five weeks, and then [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=345.56s)]
*  people start reporting it after the fact. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not done yet. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=351.44s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=353.4s)]
*  There might, they might create a fourth package for them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=354.28s)]
*  Do you realize how dumb it is that they don't even have the deal signed for the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  three packages with the, with the people that are giving them over $75 billion [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=360.6s)]
*  for the next 11 years and because Warner screwed up and had an exclusivity thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=365.48s)]
*  Didn't exercise it in time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  And from what I heard, and as you know, I have good sources in this stuff. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=374.04s)]
*  And from what I heard, it came down to a couple of conference finals games, a few, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=378.6s)]
*  not per year, just a couple, a few over the course of 11 years. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=384.0s)]
*  And that became a deal breaker as they headed to the end of the exclusivity period. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  And David Dazzle, after it runs, uh, Warner was basically like, all right, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  we'll take it in the open market then. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=400.44s)]
*  I don't know if he said that specifically, but if you let the exclusivity window [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=402.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=418.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=418.4s)]
*  Maybe you'd explain, then. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  Maybe you'd explain that this is maybe the right thing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=423.23999999999995s)]
*  Now boy's situation isல worse. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=423.76s)]
*  Or maybe the annoying thing is video is a, that person probably doesn't [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=425.71999999999997s)]

*  There's just, there's a few, there's Library of Congress divorce forms, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  so, so many of us think that triangle, there are ads for them. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=438.12s)]
*  thing. No way. The second one is, Oh, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=442.0s)]
*  well they actually might create a fourth package for us. That's not happening [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=444.6s)]
*  either. Um, cause guess who's not going to want that? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=447.64s)]
*  The other three partners who are paying all this money for exactly what is laid [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=450.02s)]
*  out in their deals. So now it's like, what happens? You're, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=454.36s)]
*  you're going to Sue. That's really what you're going to do. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=457.16s)]
*  They're like the sperm lover who, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=460.04s)]
*  who won't move their stuff out of the apartment Warner. And guess what guys, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=461.84s)]
*  get some boxes. It's time. You don't want to have the sperm lover syndrome. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=466.74s)]
*  And if they don't, they don't figure this out soon. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=470.88s)]
*  I think it becomes damaging potentially for the person who is running the entire [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=473.92s)]
*  company. Cause at some point you have to have some confidence in who's running [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=479.58000000000004s)]
*  it. And if that person, um, not only blew a deal with basketball, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=483.32s)]
*  but then is trying to hang on on the ledge, don't let me off, please. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=487.32s)]
*  Not great. I would let this one go. Move on. They did the French open thing, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  do a lot of smaller deals and just admit that this, uh, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=498.04s)]
*  this basketball thing didn't work out. Next one. Third thing, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=502.16s)]
*  just a random soccer idea with the apologies to Kevin. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=506.16s)]
*  Well, it's a half-baked idea. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=508.68s)]
*  I don't know if you saw team USA get their butts kicked by Columbia the other [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=510.56s)]
*  day. Well, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=515.4s)]
*  I was thinking about how my entire life people have been saying that soccer was [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=517.36s)]
*  going to take off and that America was, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=520.6s)]
*  was going to be good and sport of the future here and we're going to have all [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=522.76s)]
*  these people and it just hasn't happened. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=525.2s)]
*  And now I'm heading toward my mid fifties here and it feels like we're further [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=528.24s)]
*  away than we were 10, 12 years ago. Even though we have guys like Puli such, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=533.48s)]
*  um, it's probably not happening. I think it's time, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  instead of thinking about do we invest in stuff to younger academies, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=541.96s)]
*  all that stuff, maybe we need a change in PR. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=545.4000000000001s)]
*  And I was starting this by Saruti and he thought it was funny. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=550.2800000000001s)]
*  So I'm just going to introduce this theory here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe they need to start going after five star running backs, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=556.8s)]
*  basically from like eighth grade on in football and just lay out the actual [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=559.96s)]
*  financial situation running backs in the 2020s. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=565.36s)]
*  Because like, let's say you become Saquon Barkley, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=567.84s)]
*  you're one of the best talents at running back in a long time. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=570.64s)]
*  What does that mean financially? Like Saquon Barkley, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=575.48s)]
*  the Giants wouldn't even pay him. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=578.16s)]
*  He ended up going to the Eagles for like 11, 12 million a year. If you, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=579.4s)]
*  if Saquon Barkley was an awesome, awesome soccer player, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=583.16s)]
*  could he make what he's going to make it his entire NFL career and like three [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=587.0s)]
*  premier league seasons, they need to market, Hey guys, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=591.8s)]
*  there's way more money in soccer, way more, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=595.36s)]
*  not to mention all the ancillary damage from, from football, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=598.36s)]
*  but just show all the running back ages show when running backs, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  careers are over at 27, 28, 29 in soccer. You keep playing, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=606.76s)]
*  just come to the MOS when you're 39 and you're washed up, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=610.48s)]
*  you'll make another 20 million a year. This is now a PR campaign. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=613.08s)]
*  And I think soccer should look into it. That's my half-baked idea to save you a [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=616.76s)]
*  soccer. All right. Fourth, fourth thing, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=619.8000000000001s)]
*  we got to talk about the Caitlin Clark content frenzy, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=625.28s)]
*  which I've tried to stay away from, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=629.72s)]
*  but I've been just amazingly amused by everything that's happened with it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=631.28s)]
*  And why am I amused? Right. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=636.28s)]
*  What's amusing about this? It's amusing because [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=640.48s)]
*  there's an old saying about when people wrote hit pieces in magazines or [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=645.28s)]
*  newspapers or blog posts that when they really went after somebody, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=649.28s)]
*  it often said more about the writer than it did about the person that they were [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=653.84s)]
*  doing the hit piece on, right? Are they resentful or they jealous? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=659.0s)]
*  What's their purpose that are trying to get attention for themselves? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  This Caitlin Clark story, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=665.72s)]
*  whatever prism you view sports through, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=667.24s)]
*  whatever prism you view your own career through, what you want out of it, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  what kind of content you want to get day to day, week to week out of it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=676.0s)]
*  It's just perfect. Do you want to make this a story about race? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=680.0s)]
*  Voila, here it is. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=684.64s)]
*  Do you want to make it a story about older ex players [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=686.52s)]
*  resenting the new, the new class of star? Boom, sitting right there. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=691.28s)]
*  Do you want to make it about favoritism? You could do that too. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=696.7199999999999s)]
*  Did she deserve to make the Olympic team? No, she's not one of the 12 best players. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=699.7199999999999s)]
*  So why is she on it? Do you want to make it about, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  this is the fault of why we can't grow women's basketball, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=706.92s)]
*  especially at the Olympics, which was a case Christine Brennan made. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=711.64s)]
*  This is the most successful Olympic team that probably in any sport for it, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  they're going for their eighth gold and nobody's cared because they just kill [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=720.56s)]
*  everybody. So we actually needed Caitlin to, to, to trumpet how good this team is. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=723.56s)]
*  You could do that thing. You could do any sort of media beef. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=728.72s)]
*  You'd want to start. We saw today, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=734.56s)]
*  Stephen A got mad at Peter Rosenberg about something he said on a radio show and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  did an emergency YouTube clip on it. We see, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=741.8s)]
*  we've seen in fighting with the media. It's like, oh great. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  We all get to roll up our sleeves and just go at each other over this Caitlin [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=748.36s)]
*  Clark thing. We've seen reverse racism. I won't name the sites, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=751.72s)]
*  but there's a couple of them that are trying to turn this into a sports health [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=756.1s)]
*  or Skelter that we've seen. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=759.96s)]
*  We've seen the plight of women's sports and all of those stories because here's [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=764.64s)]
*  the WNBA doing the best it's ever done from a rating standpoint, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=770.44s)]
*  from an attendance standpoint, it's really on the way up. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=774.4s)]
*  And you could argue Caitlin and a couple other reasons for it, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=777.72s)]
*  but the way people have talked about it, nobody likes that either. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=781.56s)]
*  So that's another, that's another subplot. We have the, uh, the ratings. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=785.88s)]
*  People, there's like a ratings porn contingent out there talking about how great [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=791.0s)]
*  the, the ratings have been. What does this mean? Is this all Caitlin? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=795.64s)]
*  Is she getting enough credit for what she does with the league? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=799.68s)]
*  And then you have the, uh, the ex players. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  I always enjoy that the older current players lob and shots. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=804.92s)]
*  You had some incidents on the court and everybody just lost their mind every [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=810.08s)]
*  time anything happened. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=815.0s)]
*  And it was weird because let's go back to the part where it was just kind of fun [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=816.84s)]
*  to watch Caitlin Clark play basketball and see how she was going to do as a [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=819.84s)]
*  rookie in this league. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=822.7600000000001s)]
*  And instead it just had to become about all of these big issues and just people, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  everybody's like, Oh, is it time for my 15 minutes? I thought it was ridiculous. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  Um, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=834.32s)]
*  she's, you could argue has, has started more, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=835.8s)]
*  more beefs and more conflicts between people without intending to do anything. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=839.36s)]
*  All she's doing is trying to play basketball, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=843.76s)]
*  but it's almost turning into like, this is like a hip hop story. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=845.16s)]
*  But the part that got super weird, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=848.8s)]
*  I thought was the Olympics because on the surface, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=852.48s)]
*  yeah, she should be in the Olympic team because people like Caitlin Clark and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  it's fun to watch her. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=860.48s)]
*  But there's a bigger picture thing with the Olympics that I think people miss. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=861.32s)]
*  They just picked all the best players. Like you go look at, look at, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=865.88s)]
*  look at the team they had, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=870.32s)]
*  They have all the ages of the players are between 26 [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=872.5200000000001s)]
*  and 33. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=878.72s)]
*  Grinders 33 and then Tarassi is 42. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=879.88s)]
*  So she's the outlier and she has to be on the team cause she's going for six [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=882.08s)]
*  gold medals and you have to have that. But, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  it's a team where they just said, we don't, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=887.6s)]
*  we don't want to F around. We just want to keep winning the gold medal. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=890.6s)]
*  We're not trying to accomplish. We're not trying to grow the game. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=893.6800000000001s)]
*  We're just trying to kick everybody's butts. And they have tiered the scores for [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=896.72s)]
*  the last four gold medal games. They won by 21, they won by 29, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=900.64s)]
*  they won by 26, they won by 27. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=905.36s)]
*  Putting her on this team when she was like four or five years younger than [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  everybody else, she was like, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=912.44s)]
*  putting her on this team when she was like four or five years younger than every [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=914.0799999999999s)]
*  other good player who you, first of all, who you bumping. Um, second of all, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=917.7199999999999s)]
*  you're just gonna, she's going to be the only young player you have. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  To me, this is a failure of vision because, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=925.5999999999999s)]
*  and I would say this about the men's team too. The men's team, you know, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=928.8399999999999s)]
*  Bam Booker, Tatum, Edwards, Halliburton, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=933.8s)]
*  even Anthony Davis and beads not 30 yet. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=939.0799999999999s)]
*  And then the older guys are LeBron and Kawhi and Durant, Curry and Drew. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=941.92s)]
*  You don't need 12 players on a team like this. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=948.3599999999999s)]
*  You need nine or 10 and then you need two happy to be there people. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  And this is what we figured out all those years ago in the dream team when crazy [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=954.3599999999999s)]
*  Leitner gets it over Shaq, which is, we're not going to litigate that here, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=958.8399999999999s)]
*  but that was later was one of the best college players of all time. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=961.92s)]
*  Shaq was one of the best center prospects of all time. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=964.92s)]
*  He had to do it over again. Maybe put both of them on, but [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=967.3199999999999s)]
*  they, for a while there, they tried to have youth on the team. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=971.28s)]
*  And now they've just gravitated toward, we never want to lose the gold medal. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=975.64s)]
*  We're just going to kick ass. And I think I agree with it, but [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=979.68s)]
*  I think if I was like, if I was sports are, I'm never going to get elected. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to give up the dream. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=990.92s)]
*  I would want a team of like maybe nine hardcore all-stars [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=992.8s)]
*  best players in their primes peaks are heading toward their peaks. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=998.0s)]
*  So like everyone from Edwards to Tatum to Booker and probably Curry's at the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1001.52s)]
*  tail end of that. Then you want the one older star going for one last gold medal. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1006.2s)]
*  So maybe in this case, that's LeBron. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1010.88s)]
*  And then I would want the two young players. I'd want two people like somebody [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1013.48s)]
*  like Chet, put them on the team, get him the experience. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1018.24s)]
*  It's going to make them amazing. He's not going to care if he plays anyway. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1020.96s)]
*  Right. Or even Palo who was on the last USA team. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  But if you told me we had Palo and Chet as the two young guys, great. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1027.84s)]
*  That's amazing. What an awesome experience for those guys, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1032.6799999999998s)]
*  cause they're not going to play anyway, cause you need nine or 10 guys to win. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think you could make the same case with the women's team. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1039.08s)]
*  Maybe the mistake was you take nine, Tarassi's the old lion as the 10th, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1042.08s)]
*  and then you go super young with the other two. You have Caitlin, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1049.3999999999999s)]
*  and then you also have Juju Watkins. You have Cameron Brink, whatever you want to do. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1052.28s)]
*  But those last two spots, which are a little ceremony for the most part. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1056.84s)]
*  And then that allows Caitlin on the team. The other piece of this, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1060.04s)]
*  which I think people are missing, and I would call this the Tim Tebow theory, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1063.96s)]
*  which rarely happens, but when somebody is such a big star, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1068.56s)]
*  it almost becomes not worth it to have them involved on your team, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1073.3600000000001s)]
*  unless they're just going to play all the time. And I say Tim Tebow, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1076.52s)]
*  because there was a summer, I think it was summer in 2013. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1079.32s)]
*  The Patriots signed Tim Tebow as a backup quarterback. Super exciting. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1083.52s)]
*  I was all in. It was like, this sounds great. It's perfect. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1088.8s)]
*  Belichick player will play him a tight end. Third QB will run some goal line [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1091.32s)]
*  stuff from him. It'll be awesome. Well, what happened? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1096.56s)]
*  The first couple of practices, all anyone cared about was Tim Tebow. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1099.92s)]
*  It was like, you're going to play Tebow? Where's Tebow? You're going to play Tebow. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1104.28s)]
*  And guess what Belichick did after, I don't know. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1108.32s)]
*  I don't remember how long it was. He was like, F this and just wave Tebow. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1111.36s)]
*  It's like, I want no part of this. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1115.8799999999999s)]
*  The ensuing whole hullabaloo day to day over Tebow just made it not worth it to [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1117.52s)]
*  have Tebow. There were teams afraid of the hullabaloo, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1124.72s)]
*  which was the reason they stayed away. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1127.76s)]
*  There were other reasons too, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1129.36s)]
*  as we've covered many times on a bunch of different Ringer podcasts. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1130.56s)]
*  But when that hullabaloo becomes too big, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1134.28s)]
*  you better really feel good about the player. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1137.04s)]
*  And I think with the Olympic team to have Kaitlyn on the team, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1139.28s)]
*  which I was like, how is she not on the team? She's going to grow the game. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1143.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, guess what happens? You go to the Olympics and it all becomes, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1145.28s)]
*  is this Kaitlyn going to play? Why is she playing? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1148.3200000000002s)]
*  Kaitlyn only played four minutes. Should Kaitlyn play more? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1150.4s)]
*  Is Kaitlyn better than this person? And it turns into a nightmare. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1153.16s)]
*  They don't want that. So I totally get it. And by the way, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1156.2s)]
*  she would have been four years younger than everyone else on the team. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1159.2s)]
*  So I get why she didn't make it, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1161.68s)]
*  but I think it's a failure of construction more than anything else. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1163.68s)]
*  All right. Two more things for the six pack. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1168.36s)]
*  I'm in the honeymoon period with Drake May and it's marvelous. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1171.6s)]
*  It's really great. What I didn't know, I haven't had, you know, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1176.36s)]
*  I guess this will happen when the Red Sox bring up Marcelo Mayer. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1180.9599999999998s)]
*  Although I don't know if I'm ever watching a Red Sox game again. Um, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  but really with football, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1189.52s)]
*  I've never had it before cause I had the same quarterback for the entire time [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1190.56s)]
*  the internet existed basically. We drew Bledsoe and Tom Brady for, you know, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1193.4799999999998s)]
*  into the 2020s. The little pieces every day. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
*  I've really enjoyed it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1203.0s)]
*  Like there was stuff yesterday about Drake May playing dodgeball. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1203.9199999999998s)]
*  I watched multiple clips of Drake May playing dodgeball. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1208.8s)]
*  I've watched him in mini camps. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1211.9599999999998s)]
*  I've watched his like little 40 yard throws or short throws. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1213.8s)]
*  I've watched videos about people that think he doesn't have as fast of a [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1218.12s)]
*  release as Jayden Daniels doing side by side mini camp videos. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1222.32s)]
*  It's really great, but for the most part it's fun as hell. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1226.8s)]
*  And all it is is sealing and upside and happiness. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1229.6399999999999s)]
*  And there's no downside yet at all. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1232.44s)]
*  It's basically like having a rookie quarterback with social media in 2024 is [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1233.96s)]
*  the Instagram filter effect where, you know, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1239.24s)]
*  like you if you have kids or you have kids that you know, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1242.9199999999998s)]
*  they're friends and they'll take, they'll take this picture. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1247.6s)]
*  And then by the time it's done on Instagram, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1250.24s)]
*  they look like Cindy Crawford crossed with name a model from now. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1252.92s)]
*  This is what the Drake May honeymoon period is. Everything just looks great. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1258.04s)]
*  He looks magnificent. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1262.28s)]
*  I wish we could just kind of freeze it right here because I know there's going to [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1264.0s)]
*  be a game, especially if he starts where in the, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1267.6s)]
*  in the first year where he'll be terrible and be like, Oh my God, it's Drake May. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1271.28s)]
*  Good right now. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1274.24s)]
*  I feel like he's going to be the best quarterback of all time because I am in the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1275.12s)]
*  honeymoon period with Drake May. All right. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1278.52s)]
*  Last but not least the Lakers. So we taught conspiracy bill. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1281.44s)]
*  I know you, you saw conspiracy bill on Sunday's podcast, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1285.8s)]
*  who's very suspicious of the JJ Reddick and just the Lakers audibling from JJ [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1289.0s)]
*  Reddick out of nowhere to the Yukon coach, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1294.84s)]
*  Dan Hurley and the reports were being broken by agent Roger Aske who once wrote a [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1299.52s)]
*  book about the Hurley's and just, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1306.08s)]
*  it never, it never smelled right to me. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1310.92s)]
*  And it seemed like everybody was benefiting from the story being a story, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1313.36s)]
*  but not the results of the story, which the results of the story technically were, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1317.68s)]
*  Oh my God, they actually hired Dan Hurley. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1321.32s)]
*  And yet I didn't, wasn't talking to anybody who ever believed they were going to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1323.36s)]
*  hire him. So it's like, all right, who gains from this? Hmm. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1325.92s)]
*  Well the Lakers gained from this because they're obviously trying to cut the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1329.68s)]
*  price down on JJ or they absolutely don't like any of those candidates. And you [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1332.92s)]
*  know, maybe they have sincerely, we're trying to go for this. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1337.08s)]
*  Hurley gains for this because now Yukon's like, Oh my God, we may lose them. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1339.76s)]
*  And even though just signed extension, he can make more money. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1342.88s)]
*  And then Woj gains from it because he's in this blood feud with Shams and Shams [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1345.16s)]
*  had reported the Lakers were about to hire JJ. So now it's like, well actually, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1349.96s)]
*  no, they tried to hire Danny Hurley. Here's where it really fell apart for me. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1353.04s)]
*  They offered him six years, 70 million, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1357.74s)]
*  which would have made him like the six highest paid coach. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1359.66s)]
*  If you're going to actually try to hire somebody who just won two straight [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1363.24s)]
*  championships in a climate where the five best coaches in the league are all [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1367.28s)]
*  making eight figures a year. Let's just say this, it wasn't a Godfather offer. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1371.42s)]
*  It was like, it was, what was, what was Tom Hayden? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1377.48s)]
*  It was a conciliatory offer. It wasn't a Godfather offer. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1381.28s)]
*  They basically offered Tom Hayden, Tom Hagen money for, uh, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1383.72s)]
*  for Danny Hurley and it wasn't going to be enough. I thought, I had heard, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1388.24s)]
*  and apparently I had the wrong information, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1392.36s)]
*  but I heard it was triple figures and it just wasn't, you know, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1394.0s)]
*  seven years for 120. Now he's got to really figure out if he wants to take the job. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1397.0s)]
*  But then something weird happened after there was a whole, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1402.04s)]
*  there was some discourse about, well, the Lakers are a family business. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1405.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't really splurge like that. Family business was used a bunch of times. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1410.1999999999998s)]
*  This is, that was a big offer for them. They're a family business. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1415.28s)]
*  I just got to cry bullshit on this one. Um, first of all, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1419.28s)]
*  they paid the luxury tax more than any other team in the league. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1423.64s)]
*  So we'll start there. Second of all, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1426.64s)]
*  the bus family owns 66% of the team. And then the other half that the other, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1431.0400000000002s)]
*  whatever third is somebody owns a majority minority stake of that. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1436.96s)]
*  And then there's some other partners. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1441.96s)]
*  So if they were really hurting for money with the way that the, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1444.5600000000002s)]
*  the franchise values of these teams are now, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1449.5600000000002s)]
*  the Lakers, I would say if they're going to get 5 billion for the expansion [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1452.44s)]
*  teams, four and a half billion, 5 billion each, it's going great. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1457.44s)]
*  Phoenix is going to be worth over 4 billion. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1462.8400000000001s)]
*  The Lakers are the most important franchise in the league from a value [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1465.04s)]
*  standpoint. So there are a seven, 7 billion team, let's say. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1468.24s)]
*  I think that's reasonable. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1472.8400000000001s)]
*  And you can't run the day to day because you're a family business. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1474.8400000000001s)]
*  You could probably sell 5% of your business at a $6 billion valuation and make [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1478.44s)]
*  so much money that you could then kind of nudge that toward the team. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1486.44s)]
*  It'd be my guess. I don't believe the family business thing. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1489.44s)]
*  I don't think they ever really wanted to hire Dana Early. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1493.44s)]
*  I just don't believe the story. I think it's a, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1495.64s)]
*  I think it was a strategic play to try to drop the price on somebody they liked. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1499.44s)]
*  Would be my guess, but please don't call the Lakers a family business. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1504.44s)]
*  There's nobody a family business. And by the way, the other team with the, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1507.44s)]
*  the other thing with the expansion stuff, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1510.44s)]
*  because now the media state media deal is going to be done. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1512.44s)]
*  And I think what happens is, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1516.44s)]
*  is the league probably just names the price, which they did with WNBA. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1519.44s)]
*  They had the expansion teams and it basically the price. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1523.44s)]
*  This was last year was 50 million. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1526.64s)]
*  It was a $50 million expansion team. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1529.44s)]
*  And then the Toronto team just ended up, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1531.44s)]
*  the Toronto ownership team just ended up getting it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1533.64s)]
*  I think they're just going to say, here's the price. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1537.44s)]
*  It's four and a half billion each. It's 5 billion each. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1541.44s)]
*  And it's going to be Seattle and Vegas. And can you hit the price? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1544.44s)]
*  So when you think about the numbers in those contexts, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1549.44s)]
*  I think the biggest thing is the price. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1554.44s)]
*  So when you think about the numbers in those contexts, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1556.44s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the Lakers could have afforded Dan Hurley. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1562.44s)]
*  I'm almost positive. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1567.44s)]
*  Which makes me think they didn't 100% want to hire Dan Hurley. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1569.44s)]
*  Yeah, we really like him. We flew out to see him once. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1573.44s)]
*  Here's an offer. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1576.44s)]
*  Anyway, that's my superior take. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1577.44s)]
*  The Lakers, you're not a family business. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1579.44s)]
*  You have more money to spend than just about anybody. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1581.44s)]
*  You have the best franchise and you're probably in the best market for where athletes want to live [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1583.44s)]
*  and where you can get the highest tickets. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1588.44s)]
*  And I'm just not buying it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1590.44s)]
*  Not buying any of it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1591.44s)]
*  That was today's six major things. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1592.44s)]
*  Remember, get yourself a six pack of McLoBulchra, a Superior Light Beer, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1594.44s)]
*  an official beer sponsor of the National Basketball Association. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1598.44s)]
*  It's refreshing, crisp, only 95 calories. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtGaNpac9cY&t=1602.44s)]
