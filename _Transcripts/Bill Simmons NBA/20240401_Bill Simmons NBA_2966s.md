# What Did We Learn This NBA Season? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4)
*  All right, Rossello, I asked you to play a game with me called what did we learn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=0.0s)]
*  this season where we just wrote down a bunch of big picture things about the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=3.24s)]
*  season that we think will summarize the season, describe what happened this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  season, ultimately be what we remember just about the regular season. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Cause the playoffs are, you know, and we're not just talking the typical, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=15.84s)]
*  Oh my God, Yoke edge, three MVPs, four years, like just things that jump out. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=19.2s)]
*  And we mentioned Wemby at the start of, at the end of the last break. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=23.28s)]
*  If Wemby stays healthy, he's going to be the greatest center since Shaq. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=26.28s)]
*  I think that's, I would lock that in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=32.28s)]
*  And I think greatest center since Kareem is really in play for me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=35.28s)]
*  And I was looking at his stats and I was thinking in the context of he's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=39.68s)]
*  22, 12 and four this year, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  22 points, 12 rebounds, four assists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=47.0s)]
*  And he's averaging three and a half blocks a game now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=49.2s)]
*  He should 47%. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=51.2s)]
*  That's the worst his stats are ever going to be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=52.32s)]
*  And if you go back and you look at some of the greatest players in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=55.56s)]
*  the history of the league, LeBron as a rookie, 21 a game, 44%, he shot 29% from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  three Shaq was 23 a game. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=64.68s)]
*  Hakeem was 21 and 12. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=67.6s)]
*  Durant was 20 points a game, 43% shooting 29% from three. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=70.28s)]
*  Luca was 21, eight, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=75.72s)]
*  eight and six, 43%. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=81.92s)]
*  You look at guys like Dirk, Kobe, Curry, Yanis, KG, Yoke, you can't even [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  talk about the rookie years. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=89.12s)]
*  The point is like, there's going to be a 25 to 40% bump from rookie year [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=90.8s)]
*  stats to Apex stats, which means. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=95.8s)]
*  If you just look at his rookie season and then try to translate it, does [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=101.28s)]
*  this mean he's going to average like. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=104.44s)]
*  28, 17 and six with five blocks a game. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=106.16s)]
*  I don't even know what the fucking ceiling is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=112.8s)]
*  I just know I've never seen anybody like this guy before. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  What he did in that next game the other night, which I know you watched. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=117.08s)]
*  That was, I was like stupefied watching that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=121.28s)]
*  It looked like when dad decides to play with the kids and it's nerf hoop in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=124.64s)]
*  bedroom and then the dad just starts dunking and it's like, come on, dad, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  you're ruining the game. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=132.32s)]
*  It's like, come on, stop, man. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=133.16s)]
*  You can't stay in that close to the room. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=134.76s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=136.84s)]
*  That's what he's doing with adults in the best league we have. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  And I just think that for me, the ceiling is now off. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=140.84s)]
*  I don't know what to expect, but if you told me he's going to be the best [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=144.04s)]
*  center since Kareem, I would be more prone to believe that than to not believe it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=146.6s)]
*  So that's going to be the number one thing I say we learned this season is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=151.44s)]
*  he's even a better prospect than he was hyped. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  I think he's going to be the best center since Kareem. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  I think he's going to be the best center since Kareem. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=159.96s)]
*  That's why I got into picture shooting as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=161.72s)]
*  I mean, I can't trust this guy that he has to be, it's not like his [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  mind or his enthusiasm for what he's doing here is to believe, he isn't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=166.96s)]
*  going to be as good to him as he was to him because he wasn't like, leave [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  him outside. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's better. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=174.68s)]
*  He's been better, even if he had struggled and looked like cause there [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  were some moments at the beginning of the year where I was like, Oh, it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=180.84s)]
*  looks a little clunky getting into some of the offense. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=182.8s)]
*  And it's still it's like tonight was so bad because of the lineup that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  And then there was another baseline cut where he just, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=191.2s)]
*  he actually looked at the guy and point, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=194.2s)]
*  he was right at the rim and he just pointed straight up, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=196.2s)]
*  being like, hey, just throw it in the air, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=198.2s)]
*  like casual in the middle of the play. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=200.2s)]
*  And then it was like, oh, that's right, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=203.2s)]
*  I can just throw it up there to him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=204.2s)]
*  And then he has it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=206.2s)]
*  And then he gets- [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=207.2s)]
*  Throw it to the seven foot five guy [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=208.2s)]
*  who could reach at the top of the backboard. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=209.2s)]
*  The drop step turnaround and one sorta dunk [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=210.2s)]
*  on Jackson Davis' payback for when he got him. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=213.2s)]
*  And I'm still, you know, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=216.2s)]
*  it's three guys for Defensive Player of the Year. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=218.2s)]
*  It's Rudy, it's Herb Jones, or it's Wen Benyama. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=220.2s)]
*  And I know most no one else would vote for Wen Benyama. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=223.2s)]
*  I know we've already discussed it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=226.2s)]
*  It was the breakout video and the whole deal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=227.2s)]
*  I just don't think there's anybody else in the league [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=229.2s)]
*  that gets the guys to do U-turns the way he does. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=231.2s)]
*  And Gobert does it plenty. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=234.2s)]
*  I think there's some with Wen Benyama [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=236.2s)]
*  where you have guys who are like, nope. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=238.2s)]
*  And then the three dudes will be stuck [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=241.2s)]
*  on one side of the paint being like, well, what the hell? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=243.2s)]
*  Like, I thought you were gonna keep going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=245.2s)]
*  and you're supposed to cut it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=246.2s)]
*  I'm supposed to flare up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=247.2s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=248.2s)]
*  I don't want to go near him. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=249.2s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=250.2s)]
*  It's like a two second reset. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=251.2s)]
*  We're like, oh wait, whoa, okay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=252.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=255.2s)]
*  You go over there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=256.2s)]
*  They gotta bring it back out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=257.2s)]
*  It's like you start the shot clock [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=258.2s)]
*  with like five less seconds when he's out there [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=259.2s)]
*  because the first thing you go to do if you're around him, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=262.2s)]
*  you're like, wait, I don't even, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=265.2s)]
*  I don't want to get embarrassed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=267.2s)]
*  I don't want to do this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=268.2s)]
*  And it doesn't even really show up in a stat [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=269.2s)]
*  other than, you know, maybe a tougher shot [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=271.2s)]
*  a little bit later on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=273.2s)]
*  So I'm with you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=274.2s)]
*  I don't really know what the ceiling would be. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=275.2s)]
*  I don't like, if you're just talking raw numbers [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=278.2s)]
*  and the growth that we have with the best players, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=281.2s)]
*  it's a great way to look at it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=283.2s)]
*  because you look at those rookie years [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=284.2s)]
*  and you're like, yeah, this might be the worst number. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=285.2s)]
*  It'll depend on how much better the roster is around him. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=287.2s)]
*  How many shots does he want to take? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=289.2s)]
*  Do they suck again? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=291.2s)]
*  What can a real point guard do for him? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=292.2s)]
*  Just somebody who can get him 10 easy points a game. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=293.2s)]
*  Just on lobs and just good entry passes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=296.2s)]
*  Yeah. Do they add something? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=300.2s)]
*  Do we get surprised in the summer [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=301.2s)]
*  where they add somebody who's been around [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=302.2s)]
*  and wants his 20 shots? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=304.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=305.2s)]
*  So does that imp... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=306.2s)]
*  Like, if they're terrible again, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=307.2s)]
*  but just somebody who can set him up a little bit better, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=309.2s)]
*  I don't know why he couldn't get 30 [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=312.2s)]
*  if they're going to give him 18 to 20 shots a game. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=314.2s)]
*  Could he get... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=316.2s)]
*  30 seems realistic, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=317.2s)]
*  especially if he starts hitting more threes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=318.2s)]
*  You're right. I probably went too low on the points. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=320.2s)]
*  One thing that he does that I don't ever... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=322.2s)]
*  There's been other guys that do this occasionally, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=325.2s)]
*  but I don't remember seeing this quite this way is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=327.2s)]
*  his offensive rebound tip backs [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=330.2s)]
*  or his alley-oops where he just kind of redirects alley-oops, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=333.2s)]
*  but these off-balance ones where it doesn't even occur to you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=337.2s)]
*  as it's happening that he's going to actually score [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=340.2s)]
*  and then he scores. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=343.2s)]
*  Like it'll be somebody's shot. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=344.2s)]
*  He's behind somebody who's boxing him out [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=345.2s)]
*  and he'll just reach over and like flick the offense rebound in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=348.2s)]
*  and you're like, wait, did that... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=352.2s)]
*  Hey, was that legal? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=354.2s)]
*  Was that... [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=355.2s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, that was legal. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=356.2s)]
*  But it's... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=357.2s)]
*  Honestly, the only thing I can remember like this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=358.2s)]
*  is watching those wilt tapes from the early 60s [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=360.2s)]
*  when wilt was going against all those six, nine white guys [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=363.2s)]
*  and the offensive goaltending was legal [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=365.2s)]
*  and shots would just go around the rim [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=367.2s)]
*  and wilt would just come in and like tip them in. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=369.2s)]
*  But Wemby's doing it. It's not offensive goaltending, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=371.2s)]
*  but he just puts... [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=374.2s)]
*  Now that he's starting to figure out, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=375.2s)]
*  oh, and I'm around the paint, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=377.2s)]
*  good things usually happen. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=379.2s)]
*  Now that that part's unlocked, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=381.2s)]
*  his just arms create baskets constantly. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=383.2s)]
*  And this stretch that he's having now, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=386.2s)]
*  it feels legitimate to me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=389.2s)]
*  I saw, we talked about this last week, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=391.2s)]
*  but I love how competitive he is. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=393.2s)]
*  You know, like that Knicks game, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=396.2s)]
*  he gave the speech after to the sideline person [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=398.2s)]
*  in front of where they interviewed the player [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=401.2s)]
*  and he was just like, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=403.2s)]
*  we couldn't have done this without you, San Antonio. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=404.2s)]
*  Like he's just been coached perfectly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=406.2s)]
*  He went to like superstar camp in France for 10 years [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=408.2s)]
*  where there's like, here's what you do in this situation. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=411.2s)]
*  Here's what you do in this situation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=413.2s)]
*  He's just got it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=415.2s)]
*  He's got every piece of it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=416.2s)]
*  And I'm like, I could not be more all in. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=417.2s)]
*  I am all a hundred percent in. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=420.2s)]
*  I can't wait until like five or six years [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=423.2s)]
*  when he hasn't won a ring yet [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=425.2s)]
*  and guys are just shitting on him on TV. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=427.2s)]
*  That's when we'll know he's really arrived. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=429.2s)]
*  Right. We need a backlash. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=431.2s)]
*  I'm saying that because it is going to happen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=433.2s)]
*  And it's like, just remember these moments. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=437.2s)]
*  Remember these moments where nothing was really at stake [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=440.2s)]
*  and it was so much fun. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=443.2s)]
*  And could he potentially add to the list of people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=445.2s)]
*  that exceeded absurd expectations [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=448.2s)]
*  because the list is like Tiger and LeBron and you know, Otani. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=450.2s)]
*  Sort of Peyton Manning? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=457.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=460.2s)]
*  But I mean, he's just tough that his contemporary got seven of them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=461.2s)]
*  And you know, he ended up with a second one obviously with Denver. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=465.2s)]
*  Sidney Crosby mostly. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=468.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=469.2s)]
*  But in the personality part, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=471.2s)]
*  like if you talk about him going to StarCamp, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=473.2s)]
*  like obviously this has to be natural though. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=475.2s)]
*  This has to be really who he is. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=481.2s)]
*  And we had Doug McDermott on the pod this week. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=483.2s)]
*  And of course I was like, look, I'm going to do five minutes on one Banyama. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=485.2s)]
*  I think the most revealing part of that was like, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=489.2s)]
*  hey, when guys go at him, he's into it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=491.2s)]
*  He's like pissed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=493.2s)]
*  Well, remember the Chet thing was the most fun part of the season almost for him [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=494.2s)]
*  when they were just doing the mano a mano thing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=498.2s)]
*  That was great. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=500.2s)]
*  It's the best sign that that's the way he feels about himself because you know, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=501.2s)]
*  you can have all the talent, you can have all the size, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=505.2s)]
*  you can be the most heralded prospect, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=507.2s)]
*  but you never really know like deep down some guys are like, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=509.2s)]
*  this is a little harder than I thought, or this is annoying, or maybe I'll, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=513.2s)]
*  you know, get my max deal and maybe year five, I'll really start to like, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=516.2s)]
*  change my approach. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=520.2s)]
*  It seems like from day one, he's everything you could want. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=522.2s)]
*  And that's why I'm just so happy about it for him, but it is inevitable. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=525.2s)]
*  The roommate theory will strike again because it's probably going to take a while. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=529.2s)]
*  Well, I don't, maybe, I don't know. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=533.2s)]
*  Maybe the ceiling is different for him and that he's going to be so good that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=535.2s)]
*  he's going to raise people up around him. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=538.2s)]
*  But it's just, it's funny how it happens with these stars at the same timeline. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=539.2s)]
*  Come in, everybody loves you. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=544.2s)]
*  Like it's going to happen to aunt. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=546.2s)]
*  Like if aunt doesn't get one in two years. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=548.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=551.2s)]
*  It just sucks. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=553.2s)]
*  Is he taking this seriously enough? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=554.2s)]
*  Is he a little too goofy? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=556.2s)]
*  Does he need to change the people around him? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=558.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=560.2s)]
*  Everything we love about his personality now, like he's country. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=561.2s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=564.2s)]
*  Like his one liners after the dunk in Utah, all the stuff that he was saying. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=565.2s)]
*  And you're like, my God, who is this guy? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=569.2s)]
*  And then we'll take all of those things and you will not changed at all. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=571.2s)]
*  And you will not want enough for us. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=577.2s)]
*  And we'll start wondering if you're different, even though you're not. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=579.2s)]
*  He's in another Sandler movie. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=583.2s)]
*  Is he taking this seriously enough? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=585.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=587.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=588.2s)]
*  It's the, it's when Roy McElroy got a girlfriend. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=589.2s)]
*  I'll never forget that TV show. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=591.2s)]
*  It was like, well, he got a girlfriend. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=593.2s)]
*  He's the only golfers having sex. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=595.2s)]
*  He's the only one God you'd think he would have held out longer. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=597.2s)]
*  I say this carefully. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=604.2s)]
*  Wemby's season has been so good. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=606.2s)]
*  I mean, I think it's been a really good season. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=608.2s)]
*  Wemby's season has been so good. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=610.2s)]
*  That there's now only two paths for how the rest of his career goes. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=613.2s)]
*  Either he becomes at least what Shaq was and maybe Kareem or. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=616.2s)]
*  Knock on what I hope this doesn't happen, but you know, like a Ralph Sampson [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=623.2s)]
*  direction where he gets hurt or Bill Walton, like that direction. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=627.2s)]
*  And he becomes this amazing what if, or like, oh my God, if Wemby [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=630.2s)]
*  hadn't gotten hurt, dot, dot, dot. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=634.2s)]
*  And obviously we talked about last week, how light on his feet. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=636.2s)]
*  He was, I actually think, I think athletically and coordination. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=639.2s)]
*  And I just, if he gets hurt, I don't think it would be any less realistic [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=644.2s)]
*  than anyone else getting hurt. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=648.2s)]
*  I, when I watch him, it doesn't strike me as some of these other centers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=649.2s)]
*  You know, we talked about Yao and Odin and you just watch the way those guys [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=653.2s)]
*  moved up and down the corner, like, Ooh, can't imagine watching this for 15 years. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=657.2s)]
*  Wemby's light on his feet. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=661.2s)]
*  So I think that's positive, but the ceiling has been fucking removed. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=663.2s)]
*  Um, what do you have for your first, what do we learn this season? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=667.2s)]
*  I've got a few. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=673.2s)]
*  I thought we could alternate. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=674.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=676.2s)]
*  Why don't you go first? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=677.2s)]
*  Wemby, we had to hit the artist. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=678.2s)]
*  Um, I've got a few. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=682.2s)]
*  Why don't you go first? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=684.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=685.2s)]
*  304 million for Jalen Brown. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=686.2s)]
*  Fucking worth it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=688.2s)]
*  You know what? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=689.2s)]
*  That guy's been awesome. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=692.2s)]
*  I'm so proud of that guy. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=694.2s)]
*  You could go one or two ways when you get a contract like that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=696.2s)]
*  That guy has made himself better. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=699.2s)]
*  He's been the best part in the team for the last six weeks. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=701.2s)]
*  He guarded Dame Lillard and Zion Williamson within the span of eight days [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=704.2s)]
*  and took the challenge and was like, I want to fucking do this. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=709.2s)]
*  I want to fucking do this. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=712.2s)]
*  He makes big shots. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=713.2s)]
*  He's gotten better. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=714.2s)]
*  He's worked on his left hand. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=715.2s)]
*  There's an alpha side to him now that I just didn't think existed. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=716.2s)]
*  And I think he's the biggest reason. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=719.2s)]
*  If you're just looking on variables and things you didn't expect, I knew poor [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=721.2s)]
*  Zingas had a chance to be really good. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=725.2s)]
*  I knew drew holiday was going to be good. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=726.2s)]
*  I knew this team was talented, but he went up a level. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=728.2s)]
*  And for me, he's, he's an absolute all MBA guy now. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=731.2s)]
*  And I think it's going to be unfair. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=735.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be unfair. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=736.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be unfair. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=737.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be unfair. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=738.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be unfair. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=739.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be unfair for using stats to compare these dudes because [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=740.2s)]
*  Tatum could have better stats and Jalen Brown could have better stats. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=745.2s)]
*  Those guys cared about stats. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=749.2s)]
*  They do not care about stats this season. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=751.2s)]
*  They they're doing all the little shit to try to help the team win. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=753.2s)]
*  And it's stuff like yesterday when he's like, let me guard Zion. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=756.2s)]
*  I'm going to take them. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=760.2s)]
*  And that was the biggest reason they won that game. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=761.2s)]
*  I just think he's been awesome. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=763.2s)]
*  And it's like, he took so much shit for that contract and everybody should [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=765.2s)]
*  apologize. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=768.2s)]
*  The defense against New Orleans is that game developed was off the charts. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=769.2s)]
*  Did you know that he had it in him to do that? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=773.2s)]
*  Well, it's funny because there was one moment in the game where he was standing [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=776.2s)]
*  directly next to Tatum. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=779.2s)]
*  And it was just one of those reminders like how guys are size wise. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=781.2s)]
*  You're like, man, Tatum is significantly bigger than Jalen Brown. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=784.2s)]
*  And you're like, but Jalen is taken on whether it was the Dame assignment, the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=787.2s)]
*  Zion stuff. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=791.2s)]
*  I like how you rounded up his name. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=792.2s)]
*  Because I'm not there with you yet. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=794.2s)]
*  Well, it's it's it's not it's not an albatross. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=795.2s)]
*  It's still not awesome. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=798.2s)]
*  And by the way, him dribbling in traffic, I'm still nervous every time. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=799.2s)]
*  I'm not saying he's perfect. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=802.2s)]
*  Were you feeling this way after they blew the 30 point lead to Atlanta and the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=803.2s)]
*  first back to back loss to Atlanta when they decided to just stop? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=807.2s)]
*  Did they run out of passes in that game in the fourth quarter? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=811.2s)]
*  They were like, hey, guys, like challenges were out of passes. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=814.2s)]
*  So don't pass it to anybody. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=816.2s)]
*  Four minutes to go. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=817.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=818.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=819.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=820.2s)]
*  I don't know what to say about the last two minutes of some of these Celtics [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=821.2s)]
*  games. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=824.2s)]
*  You know, it's it's here's what I'm hoping. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=825.2s)]
*  So first half of that New Orleans Boston game was awesome. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=827.2s)]
*  It was really good. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=830.2s)]
*  It was an up and down. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=831.2s)]
*  Both teams really wanted it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=832.2s)]
*  I thought Zion was great, like just really playing hard and the Celtics didn't [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=833.2s)]
*  get a couple of calls near the end. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=838.2s)]
*  The first half and came out in the second half pissed off and played the best [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=839.2s)]
*  quarter they've played in. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=844.2s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest reason why they're so good. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=845.2s)]
*  They were like, oh, you know, we should do is go through our seven foot three [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=848.2s)]
*  guy that they don't really have a match up for. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=852.2s)]
*  And this is my point about crunch time when they play through poor Zingas, the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=854.2s)]
*  other team panics and I don't know why they haven't figured that out yet. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=859.2s)]
*  Maybe they're saving it for the playoffs, but when they play through him, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=862.2s)]
*  either on the foul line or in the low block, the other team panics and they'll [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=865.2s)]
*  send a second guy and now you have space and you have a chance to get a [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=870.2s)]
*  second guy. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=873.2s)]
*  The other team panics and they'll send a second guy and now you have space and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=874.2s)]
*  now you have open shooters when they just have Jaylen or Tatum dribbling 25 feet [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=878.2s)]
*  from the basket and everyone else is standing around. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=881.2s)]
*  It's easy to stop. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=884.2s)]
*  The other team's rooting for you to do that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=886.2s)]
*  And to me, poor Zingas is the crunch time weapon in this team that they just [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=888.2s)]
*  don't use. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=892.2s)]
*  And last night they used it or yesterday. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=893.2s)]
*  I generally agree with you. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=895.2s)]
*  You know, it's one of those things whenever we talk about like some of these [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=897.2s)]
*  bigger decisions and you sit in a room and you go, hey, do we want to make [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=899.2s)]
*  Jaylen Brown the highest paid player in the history of the sport? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=902.2s)]
*  Then you should sit there and be able to say no, but it's just not the way that [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=905.2s)]
*  it works with NBA contracts. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=908.2s)]
*  It's why. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=909.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=910.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=911.2s)]
*  So what are you going to do? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=912.2s)]
*  Just going to let them walk to prove a point. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=913.2s)]
*  You're going to hold out. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=914.2s)]
*  And so then what? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=915.2s)]
*  When you look at the salary structure, what you owe everybody else. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=916.2s)]
*  So I'm I'm generally with you. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=919.2s)]
*  I just had to push back on the left hand thing a little bit. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=921.2s)]
*  I'm going to stay on that theme, though, because this is good. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=923.2s)]
*  This is something I've been thinking about. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=925.2s)]
*  If I were a feature writer, I would do this piece. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=926.2s)]
*  I would talk to GMs from multiple sports and I would talk about this. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=928.2s)]
*  And maybe it had to do with, I don't know, a couple of months ago, I went to go play [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=931.2s)]
*  hoops and a dad and his son kicked us off because they said they had drill work to do. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=936.2s)]
*  I said, why don't you just have your son play with us? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=943.2s)]
*  And he was like, what are you nuts playing a game to learn basketball? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=946.2s)]
*  So I don't want to make this to learn how to interact with other players in a chemistry [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=951.2s)]
*  fashion. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=957.2s)]
*  So I have a working theory. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=958.2s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=960.2s)]
*  But, you know, there's been a multiple multiple. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=962.2s)]
*  There have been multiple factors on why we've seen some of the offensive explosion and, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=965.2s)]
*  of course, the officiating correction that we've seen a month or so. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=969.2s)]
*  But. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=973.2s)]
*  Is there an easier score on top of we've never had better scores? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=974.2s)]
*  We've never had more talented players. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=978.2s)]
*  It's just not debatable. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=980.2s)]
*  But sometimes I wonder. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=981.2s)]
*  If too much of the offseason work goes into individual performance where you're working [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=985.2s)]
*  on these drills solely to try to have like as many finishing moves, as many moves into [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=994.2s)]
*  your shot as you possibly can have, because you'll see these isolated moves in game [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1002.2s)]
*  state. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1007.2s)]
*  You're like, I can't even believe he thought that was a good idea. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1008.2s)]
*  And it went in and I'm talking across the league. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1010.2s)]
*  Like SGA shot that beat the Knicks. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1013.2s)]
*  Like that was a brutal shot. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1015.2s)]
*  Now, granted, he had McBride on him, so it was a little easier to shoot over the top. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1017.2s)]
*  McBride was the original defensive assignment, so it wasn't kind of some switch with four [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1020.2s)]
*  seconds left. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1024.2s)]
*  So, you know, that's that's a different debate for New York. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1025.2s)]
*  No, not from that angle and the way he turned around on it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1028.2s)]
*  But like every night, there's so many of those shots. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1031.2s)]
*  You're like this. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1034.2s)]
*  This league is stacked. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1035.2s)]
*  But. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1036.2s)]
*  I think it's hurting execution. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1037.2s)]
*  At times, and I've asked him and you almost need a name for this theory. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1039.2s)]
*  It's like the. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1043.2s)]
*  The individual skill personal trainer albatross personal trainer albatross theory. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1044.2s)]
*  So the stuff that you're working on and then you come in the season, I wasn't going to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1051.2s)]
*  go there, but. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1056.2s)]
*  But it but it takes away from like, OK, but do you do you know what are you recognizing [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1057.2s)]
*  the help tendencies? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1065.2s)]
*  Are you taking a shot like I was at a Clippers Lakers game, the big comeback with LeBron? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1066.2s)]
*  There was a two for one where it was Westbrook, I think, Harden to end the quarter. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1072.2s)]
*  It was one of the worst two for ones like Westbrook tried it and then Harden tried it [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1076.2s)]
*  or the other way around. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1080.2s)]
*  No, that wouldn't work. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1081.2s)]
*  No, excuse me. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1082.2s)]
*  Westbrook wasn't playing. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1083.2s)]
*  It was D'Angelo Russell, one of my other favorites, and then Harden tried his and they were just [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1084.2s)]
*  two absolute dog shit shots. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1088.2s)]
*  And you're like, cool guys. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1090.2s)]
*  You both tried to out two for one each other. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1091.2s)]
*  And so I wonder if there are coaches or general managers that would say and I've talked to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1093.2s)]
*  a few people that think I'm on to something with it or they've talked about it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1098.2s)]
*  And then I asked a hockey guy, I asked a guy who lives out here, works for an NHL front [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1101.2s)]
*  office. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1106.2s)]
*  And I said, look, this is something I'm noticing in basketball, but I don't know. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1107.2s)]
*  I know that you're not going to be able to do that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1111.2s)]
*  I know that you're not going to be able to do that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1113.2s)]
*  I'm like, do you have the best individual skills you've ever had in your sport? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1116.2s)]
*  But guys kind of just don't know what the fuck to do. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1120.2s)]
*  And he was like, it's all we talk about. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1123.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1126.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1127.2s)]
*  Hanlonitis. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1128.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1129.2s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1132.2s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1134.2s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1136.2s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1138.2s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1140.2s)]
*  I just wonder if guys are working on stuff that happens in a game and learning about, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1142.2s)]
*  you know, you can make this a little easier on yourself, despite your toolbox of absurd [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1157.2s)]
*  moves that gets you free for a make. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1163.2s)]
*  Do you think what you're talking about is actually a microcosm of real life? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1166.2s)]
*  Whoa, work on their own stuff and not spend enough time with other people. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1172.2s)]
*  You just Derek Thompson me. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1176.2s)]
*  Yeah, full plain English on your ass. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1178.2s)]
*  I really like that theory. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1181.2s)]
*  It's excellent. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1182.2s)]
*  I'm going to give you my next one. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1183.2s)]
*  Little less big picture, but still big picture. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1186.2s)]
*  Point cards still matter. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1189.2s)]
*  It's one of the things I learned this season. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1191.2s)]
*  That's a good segue. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1194.2s)]
*  Orlando, Phoenix, San Antonio. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1196.2s)]
*  You know, what's nice is to have a guy who could just bring the ball up, set the offense, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1200.2s)]
*  throw a good entry pass, tell guys what to do, be kind of a leader, be like, hey, man, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1205.2s)]
*  I know you missed your last four, but I'm coming to you. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1211.2s)]
*  I'm going to slash and kick. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1213.2s)]
*  Be ready. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1214.2s)]
*  I'm going to get that to you. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1215.2s)]
*  Just basic stuff that's worked in basketball for the last century. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1216.2s)]
*  Basically, I still care about it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1219.2s)]
*  I still think the position matters. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1222.2s)]
*  And even if you look at Minnesota with Conley, who's feels like he's 100 years old at this [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1224.2s)]
*  point, he's still important for that team. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1228.2s)]
*  He's that calming influence. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1230.2s)]
*  And just like, you know, it's like I watch Phoenix and I'm just like, I'd be so nice [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1232.2s)]
*  if they just had any decent point guard for 25 minutes a game to just to just be like, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1237.2s)]
*  hey, Devin Booker, I got you. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1243.2s)]
*  Just you don't have to worry about dribbling the ball up anymore or being pressured. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1245.2s)]
*  Like just go over there, stand in the corner, come off two screens. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1249.2s)]
*  I'm going to find you hit a couple of shots. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1252.2s)]
*  We don't have enough point guards is really the bigger problem. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1254.2s)]
*  But we had way worse situations. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1258.2s)]
*  I remember 04, I used to write about how Jason Kidd should be the automatic QB for both all [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1260.2s)]
*  star sides when they had the all star game. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1265.2s)]
*  He just played point guard for both sides. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1267.2s)]
*  So we've been in worse spots with this, but I still feel like point guards matter. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1270.2s)]
*  You know what's really hard to work on when you're doing individual drills? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1275.2s)]
*  Entry passes. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1280.2s)]
*  And setting up other guys. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1282.2s)]
*  The number of players that can throw good entry passes like to fake the pass one way and then [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1284.2s)]
*  throw it to the guy and a bounce like to his outside hip away from the defender. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1291.2s)]
*  It's also just a lack of post play too. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1295.2s)]
*  Like these guys will get into the post and they're so rarely getting touches down there. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1298.2s)]
*  They don't know how to shield the defender or keep the arms away or have one arm back and the other arm be the target away. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1303.2s)]
*  So sometimes it's not even the lack of entry pass stuff. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1308.2s)]
*  I'm just psyched that we're not even an hour in and we're digging really deep into one of my favorite things that I'm passionate about. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1313.2s)]
*  Like entry passes. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1317.2s)]
*  Did you see Purdue? Did you see Purdue today? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1319.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1322.2s)]
*  Some really sweet ones where they're like throwing it to Edie's left hand so he can spin right away as he gets the pass. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1323.2s)]
*  Like basic shit that we grew up with. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1329.2s)]
*  I felt like at my dying end of pickup, I was still great at throwing entry passes. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1332.2s)]
*  Like that was it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1337.2s)]
*  It was like when I was like Terminator 2 dying in the fire pit holding my hand up, I could still throw an entry pass. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1338.2s)]
*  That's why I've used to feel so bad for MB because I'm like this guy's going to go like the first five years of his career and no one can throw him an entry pass. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1345.2s)]
*  Ben Simmons couldn't do it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1353.2s)]
*  It's not just like throwing it to the guy. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1354.2s)]
*  It's like are you throwing it to him so he can catch the ball and move at the same time? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1355.2s)]
*  Are you spinning into the... [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1360.2s)]
*  That's one of the things with Jokic. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1362.2s)]
*  Like Jokic has had one of the great random games he's had in a couple years today, especially in the third quarter. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1363.2s)]
*  He's not just getting assists. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1369.2s)]
*  He's throwing every pass he's throwing. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1371.2s)]
*  It's perfect for where the guy's about to shoot a three. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1373.2s)]
*  It's an alley right next to the rim. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1376.2s)]
*  He's like basically cutting somebody's food and feeding them with it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1378.2s)]
*  And those are his passes. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1382.2s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1384.2s)]
*  I just miss great entry passes. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1385.2s)]
*  Denver, I wanted to see that from Denver today, by the way. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1388.2s)]
*  Because I know Cleveland on paper is still somebody you got to kind of take seriously. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1392.2s)]
*  And they got Mitchell back today. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1397.2s)]
*  But they've really struggled since the All-Star break. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1399.2s)]
*  Like across the board, there's not a lot there to get you really excited about. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1404.2s)]
*  But I thought Denver's offense was so bad against Minnesota. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1407.2s)]
*  It was a reminder. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1411.2s)]
*  It's like, man, Murray not being there. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1412.2s)]
*  Like Reggie Jackson is probably the only on-ball creator that they have. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1414.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1418.2s)]
*  And you could see Jokic isn't comfortable being like, do you guys really want me to take 30 shots tonight? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1419.2s)]
*  And then he was actually having some bad nights. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1423.2s)]
*  I thought Denver came out being like, enough of this shit today. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1425.2s)]
*  I know it's Cleveland, but does it really mean anything? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1428.2s)]
*  No. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1431.2s)]
*  But it's a hell of a lot better seeing that than seeing their offense get as bogged down as it looked a couple of games without Murray, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1432.2s)]
*  which is just a reminder of how important Murray is, especially in the rare minutes he's out there without Jokic. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1437.2s)]
*  It was an MVP game from Jokic. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1443.2s)]
*  He was like, I don't really like the way we've been playing lately. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1445.2s)]
*  So I'm just going to be completely awesome for two and a half hours. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1447.2s)]
*  Let's take a break and then we'll keep going with this. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1450.2s)]
*  Mobley was good. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1452.2s)]
*  Mobley? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1453.2s)]
*  No, he was. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1454.2s)]
*  He was good today. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1455.2s)]
*  I was like talking to the no-hitter. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1456.2s)]
*  I didn't want to say anything. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1461.2s)]
*  He's been hitting a big three in crunch time the other night. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1463.2s)]
*  There's been some moments where I'm like, because I haven't sold one cent of my stock. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1466.2s)]
*  I just don't think he's going to be nearly the guy ceiling wise that we hoped for the job. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1471.2s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1476.2s)]
*  This is actually good because I have a few more of these. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1477.2s)]
*  Which direction do I go here? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1479.2s)]
*  Let's just stay on the Mobley thing. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1480.2s)]
*  Because I think the lesson with some of these younger players is you'd rather be wrong, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1481.2s)]
*  just flat out be wrong than quit on the player. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1485.2s)]
*  And this Jalen Green resurgence. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1488.2s)]
*  I had the same one. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1491.2s)]
*  Is terrific. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1492.2s)]
*  I think the Cade stuff from earlier in the year, you're like, wait a minute, what is this guy? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1493.2s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1497.2s)]
*  It's a shitty situation. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1498.2s)]
*  We've covered the Pistons. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1499.2s)]
*  At least they're a bad team with players that I kind of like, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1501.2s)]
*  which is the same way I thought of Houston before they went on this run. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1503.2s)]
*  Whereas I could get his team isn't any good, but at least there's a couple things you're like, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1506.2s)]
*  what if this breaks the right way? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1509.2s)]
*  Or Jalen Suggs, another really good example. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1511.2s)]
*  Out of the gate, you're like, there's just not enough offense. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1513.2s)]
*  This is who Gonzaga actually thought they got. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1516.2s)]
*  They're like, they didn't think he could shoot it that well. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1518.2s)]
*  And this is actually really who he is. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1520.2s)]
*  And how do you play this undersized guard who can't even shoot and all these different things? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1521.2s)]
*  We get really excited about the top picks. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1525.2s)]
*  We want them to be awesome right away. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1527.2s)]
*  And look, I know everybody's killing our guys scoot after the minus 58, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1529.2s)]
*  but I'll say this about a minus 58. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1533.2s)]
*  You can't do it by yourself. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1535.2s)]
*  What's tough is he's also at a minus 57. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1540.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1542.2s)]
*  Nope. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1543.2s)]
*  Not great. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1544.2s)]
*  Not awesome. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1545.2s)]
*  Not great. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1546.2s)]
*  Bob. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1547.2s)]
*  Well, I wrote down the same thing, Rossello. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1548.2s)]
*  I wrote Jalen Green reminds us yet again, it's terrifying to give up on elite raw talent. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1550.2s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1556.2s)]
*  And his OKC game, it wasn't even the numbers of the makes or the way he played like decisions every single time. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1557.2s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1565.2s)]
*  The right decisions in that Oklahoma City win. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1566.2s)]
*  I was like, I didn't even know that I was like, I don't even there was a point where I was like, he's never going to be like that. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1569.2s)]
*  He's never going to figure this out. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1574.2s)]
*  If you had just showed us that game two months ago, we wouldn't have believed it was him. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1575.2s)]
*  Right. You'd have been like, what did he get replaced? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1579.2s)]
*  I wrote down five guys for this. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1582.2s)]
*  Mowgli, Garland, Cade, Ivy, and Lamello. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1584.2s)]
*  And Lamello is the one I would be the fastest to give up on because I don't know if the light bulb is going to click for him. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1591.2s)]
*  But I just want to see him play at this point. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1598.2s)]
*  So, yeah, well, every year it's something. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1600.2s)]
*  All right. I'm going to I'm going to go. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1603.2s)]
*  Cleveland has to trade Mitchell this summer. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1607.2s)]
*  And it's like in all caps and bold where the teams, it's not perfect. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1609.2s)]
*  It feels like they've gotten worse in March. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1614.2s)]
*  They were embarrassed today against Denver. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1617.2s)]
*  I just don't like what I'm watching. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1620.2s)]
*  And he had a chance. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1622.2s)]
*  You know, there was I'm sure you saw over the weekend. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1625.2s)]
*  There was a story where he could the word noncommittal could not be strong enough about they're asking about a Cleveland extension because the owner had said something about we feel really good about it. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1627.2s)]
*  And he wouldn't even be like, yeah, it'd be nice to stay here. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1637.2s)]
*  Like he was just like, I'm not talking about that. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1640.2s)]
*  And he's clearly out and they're just going to have to trade him this summer. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1642.2s)]
*  And by the way, he'll be the best trade guy in the market. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1647.2s)]
*  But I think I think to me, what is we're heading into April, there might be a month left of Mitchell on the Cavs. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1650.2s)]
*  Like we might get to the end of the month and that'll be it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1659.2s)]
*  We'll never see him in that uniform again. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1661.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1663.2s)]
*  Don't you think that's a little quick though? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1664.2s)]
*  I mean, the guy was incredible in February. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1665.2s)]
*  You know, they went on that stretch where it was what? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1668.2s)]
*  17 and one and Mowgli and Garland only put seven games each out of that stretch. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1669.2s)]
*  So he's been back. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1674.2s)]
*  What? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1676.2s)]
*  Four games. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1678.2s)]
*  I mean, I know today was ugly, but he missed the first. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1679.2s)]
*  Would you be afraid to play them in a playoffs series? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1682.2s)]
*  Because I wouldn't. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1684.2s)]
*  I just don't know who they are. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1685.2s)]
*  They're not going to be in the playoffs. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1687.2s)]
*  They're going to be in the playoffs. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1688.2s)]
*  Because I wouldn't. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1690.2s)]
*  I just don't know who they are. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1691.2s)]
*  They don't know who they are. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1693.2s)]
*  They knew who they were when it was Mitchell and Jared Allen and shooters afraid is a bit like I like Orlando. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1696.2s)]
*  I'm not afraid of playing that offense in the fourth quarter. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1703.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1706.2s)]
*  So Rudy and I talked about that before you came on. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1707.2s)]
*  It's it's too ugly. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1709.2s)]
*  Why can't Fron shoot anymore? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1710.2s)]
*  The fuck happened? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1712.2s)]
*  I don't know what's going on there. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1713.2s)]
*  It's like a 25 percent three point shooter now. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1715.2s)]
*  Anyway, since the All-Star break, Orlando is the number one defense in the NBA. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1717.2s)]
*  OK, they're the number five rebounding team. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1721.2s)]
*  They're actually 19th on offense, which for them was surprisingly higher than I thought. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1724.2s)]
*  But clutch, they're the 30th ranked offense out of there are minus 11 in net rating in clutch time. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1729.2s)]
*  It feels like it when you watch it. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1735.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1737.2s)]
*  Let me let me put fake Fandl odds on this. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1738.2s)]
*  I'll give you even odds. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1741.2s)]
*  Mitchell is in a Cleveland uniform in October. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1743.2s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1746.2s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1747.2s)]
*  I bet no, because you can't lose this asset for nothing. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1748.2s)]
*  But what if Mitchell said, hey, I'm in and that meant you had to trade Garland? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1753.2s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1757.2s)]
*  There's some teams that I feel like would go one hundred and forty cents in the dollar for Garland. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1760.2s)]
*  So maybe that's the move. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1767.2s)]
*  What if you go to Mitchell, like, hey, we used to because look, are you going to go to the Knicks now? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1768.2s)]
*  Like everybody thought, well, that doesn't even make any sense anymore. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1772.2s)]
*  And I still wonder what the Knicks are going to do with the OG price, even though, like, do you feel like they had already figured that price out the same way the Pacers had to figure out, get some assurances on Siakam? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1775.2s)]
*  Miami is always lingering with this stuff. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1786.2s)]
*  Yeah, Mitch. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1788.2s)]
*  I'm not talking about OG. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1789.2s)]
*  I'm talking about Mitchell. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1791.2s)]
*  OK, I'm just saying like that. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1792.2s)]
*  But I'm just thinking about if he's leaving Cleveland, where's he going? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1794.2s)]
*  Which is a great point. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1798.2s)]
*  I don't think he goes to the Knicks at this point because I think they're long game now. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1799.2s)]
*  Brunson is so good. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1802.2s)]
*  Their long game now is let's get McKell Bridges and let's keep filling around the fringes and just keep making this team awesome and wait for could Yannis be available in two years, shit like that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1803.2s)]
*  I love the score thing. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1814.2s)]
*  Mitchell and Brunson would probably just be too much. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1815.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1819.2s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1820.2s)]
*  OK, so it doesn't fit with what they're. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1821.2s)]
*  So to me, it's Miami. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1823.2s)]
*  It's Brooklyn. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1824.2s)]
*  You just want to be in New York. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1825.2s)]
*  Same page then. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1826.2s)]
*  OK, do you agree with me that Mitchell, because we've just seen and I like Garland a little bit, I think it's a little bit of a different thing. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1827.2s)]
*  And I like Garland a lot that Mitchell's like peak version of him, especially with some of the playoff stuff that we have seen that you're like, OK, well, if Mitchell's in, we commit to Mitchell long term. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1832.2s)]
*  And then we figure out how to piece that stuff around in a Garland trade. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1844.2s)]
*  And I'm with you. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1847.2s)]
*  This is our weakness, though, with Garland, because I think we both both of us like him maybe more than the asset itself. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1848.2s)]
*  I love Garland. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1856.2s)]
*  I still feel I want to see him with his own team at some point. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1858.2s)]
*  That's the San Antonio move in my mind. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1861.2s)]
*  That's like the San Antonio overpay where it's like, let's just start with one being Garland. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1863.2s)]
*  So if that would involve Mitchell one is staying Cleveland. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1869.2s)]
*  All right, we went to long. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1873.2s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1874.2s)]
*  I'll do I'll do a quicker one here. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1876.2s)]
*  The Latvian laser. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1880.2s)]
*  Davos Bertons. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1884.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1885.2s)]
*  Did some shooting drills with his Latvian coach. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1888.2s)]
*  I learned about this on the broadcast today where the Latvian coach thought his American shooting drills were too easy. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1890.2s)]
*  So they had him do the shooting drill with gloves on, gardening gloves. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1898.2s)]
*  And he couldn't stop until he made 10 in a row with gloves on. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1904.2s)]
*  So I just wanted to add that to perhaps the list. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1908.2s)]
*  What did we learn this season? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1911.2s)]
*  The dumbest fucking training methods ever. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1912.2s)]
*  Because I just amazing tidbit gardener gloves for a three point shooter. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1921.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's all sorts of stuff and I patch I believe in there. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1925.2s)]
*  They were giving us everything that Charlotte broadcast. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1928.2s)]
*  You know, I love the Charlotte broadcast. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1930.2s)]
*  You never know what you're going to get. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1932.2s)]
*  They keep the energy high all the time, but he had to make 10 in a row with with gardening gloves on. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1934.2s)]
*  Steve Lapis said with six minutes to go in the Purdue game that. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1940.2s)]
*  That Edie and Connect on Tennessee that these were two of the greatest performances in the history of this tournament. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1945.2s)]
*  Steve Lapis said this with six minutes left. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1955.2s)]
*  The game. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1957.2s)]
*  I don't even think both of them had more than 30 points yet. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1958.2s)]
*  And his play by play guy was like, well, maybe we're getting there. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1961.2s)]
*  It was like one of those. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1966.2s)]
*  I think they were thinking about cutting his bike. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1968.2s)]
*  There is an NBA broadcast. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1970.2s)]
*  I'm not going to say which one where the guy had been in for three and a half minutes. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1972.2s)]
*  And I'll admit he wasn't exactly lighting it up. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1976.2s)]
*  He wasn't super noticeable, but he was so unnoticeable to this broadcast that they said he had just checked in. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1980.2s)]
*  He'd been playing for three and a half minutes. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1986.2s)]
*  That doesn't happen. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1988.2s)]
*  Wasn't John Tate Porter? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1990.2s)]
*  No, no, I don't know what he'll be checking in. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1992.2s)]
*  I have. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1995.2s)]
*  I'll do three quick ones. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1996.2s)]
*  New owner syndrome, undefeated. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=1999.2s)]
*  I just think I should be like, it can't be forgotten. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2001.2s)]
*  This latest like. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2003.2s)]
*  Going all in on Bradley Beal, who's a nice player, but you know, you're paying 50 billion a year for somebody who's like 17 a game and gets hurt every few weeks. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2005.2s)]
*  You can build a real contender around Zion. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2015.2s)]
*  I think we learned that this season for real. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2020.2s)]
*  I don't know if he can stay healthy, but this was the first time watching this team where I'm like. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2023.2s)]
*  Yeah, I see it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2028.2s)]
*  I see it on both ends because I think his defense has been way better. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2031.2s)]
*  I don't the rebounding I'll never be happy with, but from a two way standpoint, Zion and shape, I feel like. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2035.2s)]
*  That's the foundation of a team that is going to be a bitch in the playoffs. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2042.2s)]
*  If you can stay in shape, I know that's in your real house. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2046.2s)]
*  And then just we've talked about this before, but and with just having the ceiling now as being the best under 30 USA guy is something we learned this season, but we don't need to talk about that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2049.2s)]
*  What do you have for your next one? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2059.2s)]
*  Phoenix, I think I'm off totally that loss on Monday against San Antonio. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2061.2s)]
*  They were so bad on defense and they get Denver for the second time in. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2066.2s)]
*  I don't know three weeks. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2073.2s)]
*  And then they play out OKC on Friday and I was kind of looking forward to that because I'm just like holding out hope being like, are you guys going to put together some kind of stretch here? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2076.2s)]
*  And it felt like there was that one little stretch there in January where they won a bunch of games, but it may have been the schedule or Dallas wasn't fully formed yet. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2084.2s)]
*  But that OKC game, they're just so frustrating. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2093.2s)]
*  I don't know why they keep making the mistakes they make. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2098.2s)]
*  They close out if there's one versus two on the other side, they close out to the worst three point shooter. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2101.2s)]
*  Bowl Bowl gets eaten up on a screen. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2107.2s)]
*  He's fucking done like he's no interest in getting back to the play. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2109.2s)]
*  So I think that's why despite like some of the cool plays that end up on Instagram with him, you're just like, all right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2112.2s)]
*  And then it gets really frustrating because then you'll have Beale get stuck and he turns around and throws it to nobody. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2118.2s)]
*  Durant will have a couple plays defensively where he's a little checked out. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2124.2s)]
*  I mean, Booker is usually always my go to with them. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2129.2s)]
*  But again, San Antonio, there was a play where he just let like so hand so hand one on three on the right side and not one guy like even shifted over to him. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2131.2s)]
*  The number of times like Phoenix leads the league in after the other team scores, it's two guys underneath the basket looking at each other being like, what the hell happened there? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2138.2s)]
*  And as great as Grayson Allen has been, it's it's Grayson Allen season for any top perimeter ball handler who's just like, all right, come on out here and come get it because I'm going to go at you the entire time. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2146.2s)]
*  And when you looked at Phoenix's remaining schedule, it was off the charts harder than everybody else. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2157.2s)]
*  Denver, Oklahoma City, they split those and they finished with New Orleans, Cleveland, Minnesota, New Orleans Clippers, Clippers, Sacramento, Minnesota. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2162.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the final seed is going to be, but I think I always held out hope bill that I was going to talk myself into like a matchup where I go, OK, hey, they all played together for a month. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2170.2s)]
*  It's been three weeks ago, but I was really trying to tuck myself into it. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2179.2s)]
*  It's not there. I'm glad you brought up Grayson Allen because that was one of the things I learned this year. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2184.2s)]
*  He's not the best three point shooter in the league, and I don't even think it's a percentage thing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2189.2s)]
*  I think he's not a better shooter than Steph. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2193.2s)]
*  Come on. Listen, he's at forty seven percent for three. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2196.2s)]
*  Well, Steph does that. You know what I mean? Like, like I'm talking about that wing three point like Clay was the best guy in the league for a while. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2202.2s)]
*  Like Carl Korver was in there and JJ Reddick, you know, like that, whatever that talking about the non create your own three pointer. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2209.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm talking about that. That guy. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2216.2s)]
*  I remember one time Van Pelt and I got an argument about Curry and Korver. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't phrase it. I know what a percentage can say, but. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2218.2s)]
*  So he's at forty seven percent. He's at one hundred and eighty seven three. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2226.2s)]
*  I think he's going to be over two hundred by the end of the year. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2232.2s)]
*  Only four guys in the history of the league. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2234.2s)]
*  Two hundred threes, forty seven percent for the season. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2236.2s)]
*  Kyle Korver, JJ Reddick, Joe Harris and Glenn Rice in 1997. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2240.2s)]
*  Steph did two fifty with forty five percent twice. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2246.2s)]
*  This year, at least when I did this yesterday, maybe it flipped for a second, but only nine guys are forty three percent and up for three point shooting this season. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2250.2s)]
*  For some reason, we have more better three point shooters, but less like awesome three point shooters. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2260.2s)]
*  And Grayson Allen is just like. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2265.2s)]
*  I just would not have it, but he was the throw in for that Bucks trade. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2268.2s)]
*  Right. It's like, oh, they got Grayson Allen. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2272.2s)]
*  It's so great that you can't even play him in a playoff series. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2274.2s)]
*  And now he's basically inherited this Kyle Korver, Reddick, Joe Harris, whatever the legacy of that championship belt is. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2277.2s)]
*  And I did not have him on my bingo card. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2284.2s)]
*  I did not have him on my bingo card, Rossello is my point. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2286.2s)]
*  Well, in theory, his life should be easier the same way anyone who joins the best version of the Splash Brothers, right? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2290.2s)]
*  The same thing with Luca. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2297.2s)]
*  Like your job should be easier offensively because we have this other thing that's going to take all the attention away from you. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2298.2s)]
*  And you would think other players would figure that kind of stuff out. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2304.2s)]
*  Yeah, that in Milwaukee. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2306.2s)]
*  Yeah. But it's frustrating. That's my point, though. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2307.2s)]
*  Like it's frustrating as I've been with Phoenix, like it should be better. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2309.2s)]
*  But now it's making it sound like I'm not agreeing with you because I do agree with you. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2312.2s)]
*  And you do give him credit because now this guy's going to play in the league a really long time. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2316.2s)]
*  Like he's going to get a big number at some point where you're like, OK, because he's not just could be right now. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2319.2s)]
*  Some of these guys will just sit in the corner and it's like the only shot they have. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2324.2s)]
*  And they have this absurd percentage. And then people talk them up as shooters. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2328.2s)]
*  Grayson can get moved off of his spot, reset and then shoot because he did handle the ball enough in college. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2331.2s)]
*  Like there was more there. There was more athleticism. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2336.2s)]
*  There was a way it was like one of the things even with J.J. Reddick. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2338.2s)]
*  Like I remember the light bulb went off for me. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2341.2s)]
*  I'm like anybody that's just looking at this guy is all right. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2343.2s)]
*  You're just going to sit in the corner. We're going to space you out. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2346.2s)]
*  They kiss free throw rate attempts went way up Duke. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2349.2s)]
*  You're like, no, this guy's there's more in his bag. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2352.2s)]
*  But in the NBA, like five guys aren't allowed to do that, even if you're good at it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2354.2s)]
*  But I think the thing that makes him better than just the stick in the corner muscle memory, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2359.2s)]
*  never deviate from this shot. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2364.2s)]
*  Somebody closes out and you know the guy's going to get stuck and he can't reset. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2366.2s)]
*  Grayson can do all those things. So we agree. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2369.2s)]
*  What's your next one? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2373.2s)]
*  If you tank in Toronto, no one cares. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2374.2s)]
*  Now, I'm not anti-tank. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2380.2s)]
*  They've had some great ones. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2382.2s)]
*  There's what are they one in 14 in their last 15 or something like that? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2383.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what Fanduels numbers are every day on those. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2388.2s)]
*  But like every time you kind of look at it, like can we not have to give out a foot? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2391.2s)]
*  Can we just say that against the Raptors five times this week? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2396.2s)]
*  But at this point, it's too late. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2400.2s)]
*  Like everybody's caught on. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2401.2s)]
*  So in March, they have played Jamias Ramsey, who actually liked the tech. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2402.2s)]
*  Javon Freeman Liberty, huge fan of Independence Day. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2407.2s)]
*  Kobe Simmons. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2411.2s)]
*  Well, John is probably not going to play too many more. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2414.2s)]
*  No relation. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2416.2s)]
*  DJ Carton and [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2417.2s)]
*  Mohamedou Gay, whose brother is also in the league too. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2421.2s)]
*  I think Toronto is really, they're like, you know, they're making you work when you turn on a Raptors game. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2425.2s)]
*  Because you'd be like, wait, who the fuck is this guy again? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2435.2s)]
*  And not that anybody should be giving the Raptors a hard time because there's also their pick is top six protected. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2437.2s)]
*  They need to be in the top six. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2443.2s)]
*  They are doing the right thing, but it's just off the radar completely. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2445.2s)]
*  And tanking in general because of the play-in and certainly because of this year's draft class on top of everything else. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2451.2s)]
*  Like nobody's, I just always felt like the people screaming about how bad tanking was, even though I agreed with them philosophically, it was like, okay, what do you want these guys to do? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2457.2s)]
*  Like win games that don't matter down the stretch. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2464.2s)]
*  So congrats to Toronto. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2466.2s)]
*  It's just been a little tougher to keep up with every roster move. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2468.2s)]
*  So me and Sal and House and Hench made four bets during the All-Star break. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2472.2s)]
*  We do conglomerate bets sometimes for fun. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2477.2s)]
*  One of them was Toronto. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2480.2s)]
*  The over under for them on Fandl was like 29 and a half for wins at that All-Star break or 28 and a half. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2483.2s)]
*  It was high 20s. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2489.2s)]
*  And I was like, we're going fucking under. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2491.2s)]
*  Toronto wants to keep their pick under. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2493.2s)]
*  One of the other ones we did was Detroit, who has to get to 14 wins for us. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2496.2s)]
*  And they're at 13. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2500.2s)]
*  And that's been worth the price of admission because they lose games on bam 27 footers. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2501.2s)]
*  And so Hench just goes nuts on all of those. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2506.2s)]
*  And then we did Dallas and Milwaukee both to win their divisions as a parlay at four to one. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2509.2s)]
*  So those are the three. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2515.2s)]
*  But it's just been fun because Toronto by the first week of March, we're like, lock that one in. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2517.2s)]
*  It's a wrap. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2523.2s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2525.2s)]
*  I definitely think if you're on it, you can. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2527.2s)]
*  Well, that's why you're going to move to Vegas. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2530.2s)]
*  You're going to do one year in Vegas where you just lose your mind. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2533.2s)]
*  I had so much fun going and just see. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2537.2s)]
*  I know that look because I've seen it and I've had it. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2541.2s)]
*  You had a twinkle in your eye that one time we were in Vegas. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2544.2s)]
*  You're just like, man, I could just really live here and just bet games and have a good time. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2548.2s)]
*  It would have to be a promotional thing. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2556.2s)]
*  It would have to be something where there's a reason. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2558.2s)]
*  He sent you to Vegas for a month. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2560.2s)]
*  Yeah. And you go, I'm going to bet every game on the slate in Vegas. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2562.2s)]
*  I've even thought about it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2565.2s)]
*  But the no ocean thing, I'm not a Vegas guy. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2567.2s)]
*  All right. I already know that. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2570.2s)]
*  But I also like the ocean. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2571.2s)]
*  To be able to just wake up and then look at the board. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2573.2s)]
*  And then I started talking to the guys at the Aria book. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2576.2s)]
*  And I'd be like, hey, what are you? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2580.2s)]
*  Like, what's going on? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2584.2s)]
*  Who's doing what? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2586.2s)]
*  And then I was there enough that I'd get drinks with a couple of different guys. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2589.2s)]
*  And then they would just be telling me about the world. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2594.2s)]
*  And that's, I think, especially when you have to give out picks and how frustrated you get when you don't get things right. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2596.2s)]
*  But back to the original point, I think if you're on it, people are on it. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2600.2s)]
*  When you look at those totals for the second half after the All-Star break, to your point, Toronto, having to find a way to protect that pick. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2604.2s)]
*  Hey, which regular season team doesn't give a shit? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2611.2s)]
*  Punts on the rest of this. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2614.2s)]
*  Okay, why are they projected to go seven, eight games over 500 when they haven't done that in the first half? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2616.2s)]
*  So that's something I think I'll put more work into next year when we have to give out those picks. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2620.2s)]
*  I left one other bet we did, which was classic, was we did the Minnesota Over, which was 56 and a half. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2624.2s)]
*  And like a day later, Towns got hurt or two days later, whatever it was. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2630.2s)]
*  Like, Towns got hurt within a week of when we made that bet. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2635.2s)]
*  Last one from me. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2639.2s)]
*  And we talked about OKC earlier, but I do wonder, is this Golden State for the 2020s potentially? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2641.2s)]
*  Because we're 10 years from Golden State in 2014 when there were pieces of what we ended up. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2650.2s)]
*  All of a sudden in a year, they won the title. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2657.2s)]
*  But in 2014, that was the Mark Jackson dresses in black for game seven against the Clippers. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2659.2s)]
*  But we were like, Clay and Curry, this is potentially special. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2664.2s)]
*  Like there's something here. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2669.2s)]
*  We didn't think they were winning the title a year later. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2671.2s)]
*  We didn't know they were winning four titles over the next eight years. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2673.2s)]
*  But we knew something was going on. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2675.2s)]
*  And I wonder with OKC, like you think like what's the 2020s version of Small Ball? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2680.2s)]
*  And it's pretty similar to what the Warriors had where you have the one awesome guard, in this case SGA. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2686.2s)]
*  You have the one great sidekick, Jalen Williams, who we talked about earlier in the podcast. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2693.2s)]
*  And then you have to have this one super unique big. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2697.2s)]
*  So in the mid 2010s, they had Draymond, who it took us a while to realize like, oh, could Draymond just be their starting center? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2700.2s)]
*  And then all of a sudden happened. And I think it's Chet for OKC. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2708.2s)]
*  So they have the same foundation. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2711.2s)]
*  They also have, you know, Golden State had the Black Swan event of KD in 2016. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2713.2s)]
*  These guys have all these picks that they're going to have to cash in at some point. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2719.2s)]
*  But I guess the recipe is some luck, some skill with who you picked and a really savvy plan. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2723.2s)]
*  And in this case, the luck was the SGA getting SGA in that Paul George trade and getting trading for a guy who ends up being one of the five best guys in the league. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2730.2s)]
*  It's just really unusual. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2740.2s)]
*  It does not happen very often on top of all the picks they got. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2742.2s)]
*  So anyway, I just I think they're on the same kind of trajectory Golden State was. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2746.2s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to mean one title, three titles, four titles, zero titles, but they're hitting a lot of the same checkpoints. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2750.2s)]
*  I wonder if they would package Giddy. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2757.2s)]
*  I think you'd have to think about it. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2761.2s)]
*  Because he he kind of when we talked earlier about teams that how important the point guard position is and somebody who can just take control of the team and run it and throw good entry passes and set guys up, he can do that. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2765.2s)]
*  It doesn't really get to use those skills in the same way in this OKC team. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2779.2s)]
*  Yeah, because the last couple of weeks have been just a reminder and how big he is, too. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2783.2s)]
*  And on some of those drives, but obviously there'd be some challenges. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2789.2s)]
*  You wonder if. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2793.2s)]
*  You know, the other team would be leery of it, even though he's cleared after the investigation. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2795.2s)]
*  But, you know, I don't I don't know what's going to happen as far as if you were available. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2800.2s)]
*  I'm sure 29 teams wouldn't say, hey, not interested. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2805.2s)]
*  So they're getting close. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2809.2s)]
*  Do you have any more or do you want to take a break? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2811.2s)]
*  What's your what's your one you wanted to do and you held off on and decided, no, I'm not going to throw that one out there. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2814.2s)]
*  I have one. I'll throw it out, but I'm only going to do it if you do it. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2820.2s)]
*  Do you know who leads the league in fourth quarter scoring? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2825.2s)]
*  Is it the Rosen? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2831.2s)]
*  No, it's a really good guess. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2833.2s)]
*  It is. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2835.2s)]
*  LeBron James. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2837.2s)]
*  With 40 today, thought it was worth mentioning him. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2839.2s)]
*  The 40 piece. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2842.2s)]
*  And that's I, you know, I'm glad you brought him up because he's probably going to make it on the team. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2844.2s)]
*  And he had nine three pointers today and he's, you know, still chugging along, man. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2849.2s)]
*  You're 21. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2855.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's one box is too young. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2857.2s)]
*  I mean, look, it's a lot of the good guys. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2860.2s)]
*  You'd expect the ball to be in their hands at the end. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2862.2s)]
*  The Rosens eight. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2865.2s)]
*  He's only an eighth and a point off. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2866.2s)]
*  So that was a really good guess. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2868.2s)]
*  I'm trying to find Jaylen Williams is actually 14th and I think he's ahead of. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2870.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's ahead of SGA. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2875.2s)]
*  So but if I look at the points, I bet you the differential isn't all that much. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2877.2s)]
*  Jaylen's at seven points yet. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2882.2s)]
*  SGA is six point three. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2884.2s)]
*  Larry Mark and in plucky Utah jazz. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2885.2s)]
*  Talk about tanking. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2889.2s)]
*  They were like, we got to get rid of some of these guys that are helping us. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2891.2s)]
*  Well, I'm glad to see the Kings get a win there because this back to back Dallas losses were frustrating. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2894.2s)]
*  You could even call the first one a little scheduling, but I think it's just a wake up call of where Dallas is now in the West. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2898.2s)]
*  And the Kings are a cross off to be if Monk's going to be out for 46 weeks. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2904.2s)]
*  That's that's terrible news. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2908.2s)]
*  That's the team you want to play now if they're in there. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2909.2s)]
*  I'm going to mumble my last one under my breath and then we'll go to a break. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2912.2s)]
*  He culture. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2917.2s)]
*  Might not work quite as well when the league is really super loaded. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2919.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2926.2s)]
*  Just saying it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2927.2s)]
*  Dangerous territory for these two guys. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2928.2s)]
*  Dangerous territory. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2931.2s)]
*  But I was way more anti them than you were last year. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2932.2s)]
*  So I should be the one saying it's kind of tough to press that on off button whenever you want. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2935.2s)]
*  When there's like 18 good teams in the league. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2941.2s)]
*  I wonder how they're going to close these last two weeks. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2944.2s)]
*  That's the team. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2947.2s)]
*  Them and them and Cleveland are the two teams. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2948.2s)]
*  I just have no feel for. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2950.2s)]
*  I don't understand either team at all. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQXhsBVm4&t=2952.2s)]
