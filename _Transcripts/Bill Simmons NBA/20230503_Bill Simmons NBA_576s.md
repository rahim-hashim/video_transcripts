# Are the Celtics Missing Mental Toughness? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyYBdHEsflE)
*  All right, Mayonix, fundamentally, we sure this Celtics team has it?
*  No.
*  It's a feeling I've had for months that they're missing something.
*  And it's a combination.
*  If I had to do like a pie chart, what is the Celtics team missing?
*  There's a toughness piece that I think it's missing.
*  And I think they were definitely missing it last year too.
*  And you saw Draymond exploit it.
*  I don't know if that piece has necessarily gotten better.
*  It's a really great group of guys, really respectful character guys.
*  And I'm not saying they need to go out and get Dylan Brooks.
*  But does this team need...
*  You know, you watched PJ Tucker last night.
*  He did like, what, seven illegal things during that game.
*  Like he accidentally hit Tatum in the balls, did he?
*  Was it accidental? I don't know.
*  He's setting screens, sticking his leg out.
*  He's undercutting people on rebounds.
*  Like his physicality was there.
*  You watched Lowry on Sunday against the Knicks.
*  Like just took over that game psychologically.
*  All the stuff he was doing.
*  Smart used to be the guy who did this stuff on the Celtics team.
*  And it's not happening this year.
*  But you think like Smart versus Harden.
*  There was that famous Houston Celtics game a few years ago
*  when he goaded Harden into that charge and he really rose to the occasion against Harden.
*  And that was one of the things I thought last night.
*  Oh my God, he's going to do all the Marcus stuff against Harden.
*  And it's like he's at a different phase of his career now.
*  So I guess I'd start there.
*  Is this team missing a toughness that you need to win four rounds?
*  Let me say this first.
*  There's no way PJ Tucker did that accidentally.
*  You'll never get me to believe that.
*  I watched that a dozen times.
*  That's how I felt as well.
*  There's no way he swings the right arm and maybe didn't mean to connect exactly where he did.
*  But he meant to do something there.
*  I'd be surprised if the NBA wasn't taking a pretty long look at it right now in the league office.
*  It's hard to say that they're missing that when it comes to needing it to win a championship
*  because they showed really good mental toughness in the conference playoffs last year.
*  Like regardless of Middleton being out, being down 3-2 against Milwaukee
*  and having Tatum go nuts in game six and Grant Williams go nuts in game seven.
*  That's a guy they're missing.
*  Whatever happened to him, he's someone they need.
*  And then look, going down to Miami and winning a game seven against Jimmy Butler
*  and that team takes a certain level of mental toughness.
*  So what I think about the reasons they lost to Golden State in the finals,
*  like toughness isn't among the top three reasons to me.
*  I think exhaustion was probably one of it.
*  Inexperience was another one.
*  I don't think they needed to go out and get that guy.
*  I think maybe Marcus Smart could do more of that with this team
*  because he really is the only one on that roster kind of built for that.
*  But I don't think they necessarily need to.
*  I just think they've had it on cruise control really since opening night.
*  Like they picked up from game six of the NBA finals to game one of the regular season in a good way.
*  They kept all the momentum they built from January on of last season
*  and were able to roll through a few bumps along the way.
*  January, February, some stuff came up.
*  But they've just never really had to overcome real adversity up at this point.
*  They never had to deal with on a coaching level, on a leadership level.
*  They never had to do that with this group.
*  But now they may have to.
*  Like this game too is kind of the ball game here.
*  Like I don't think they're winning four out of five against Philadelphia.
*  Now I think we're going to see if that same mental toughness that existed when Ime Udoka was the coach,
*  when they were coming back against Milwaukee, beating Miami.
*  Now is the first time all season long, I think,
*  that we're going to see if that mental toughness is actually there.
*  Well, that's why I brought up the toughness thing because they don't have Ime Udoka anymore.
*  And I felt like he was the toughest guy on that whole team last year.
*  And I watched it.
*  I saw it in person.
*  Like he really held those guys accountable.
*  He would get really mad when they drifted through certain stretches.
*  They had the same end of the game crunch time stuff issues last year that they're having this year.
*  But I did think that he added a certain element that is missing now.
*  And I keep going back to Jalen Brown.
*  There was a sequence, I think it was like three and a half, four minutes left in the game
*  when Jalen Brown had the ball in transition and he just kind of pulled it back.
*  Yeah, he pulled it back, which like, you know, I'm half kidding, but it's like,
*  was Jalen Brown protesting something or on strike during the second half of this game?
*  He had a quote after the game where somebody asked him about this.
*  And he said, I wanted to make sure my teammates were running with me.
*  And I'm just reading that.
*  I'm like, what does that even mean?
*  I don't know.
*  Like you're eight for 10.
*  Like you're the all NBA guy, you know, probably.
*  Like you've got to be more assertive in these situations.
*  Force transition at times.
*  I know a lot of times they're taking the ball out of the bucket
*  because Harden was out of his mind.
*  But like the fact that he took 10 shots, Bill, and that it made eight of them.
*  And that was it in 42 minutes.
*  42 minutes of this guy takes 10 shots was wild to me.
*  That was the most wild statistic of that entire game was that Jalen Brown wasn't more assertive.
*  He's got to be that guy.
*  Like, you know, he and the people around him and campaigning all year long
*  to have him on the all NBA team.
*  He's got to be an all NBA player in those moments.
*  You can't just beat him.
*  You can't be inbounding the ball to smart.
*  You've got to take advantage of these matchups because not only is Billy bad in transition
*  without him beat in there, they're pretty bad defensively period.
*  Like you can't protect the run at all.
*  So like Jalen Brown needs to be aggressive.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  There's like some small underlying stuff with this team that nothing major.
*  Right.
*  But like you mentioned the Jalen 10 shots thing, there's a sometimes it'll be a Tatum game
*  and sometimes there'll be a Jalen game and one guy will back.
*  Like they've never totally figured out the seesaw with that.
*  Jalen's had just a weird energy this whole season.
*  There's been multiple moments with him where it's like, do you want to be here?
*  Do you like it here?
*  Is this, is this a good situation for you?
*  I have no idea what the effects of the KD trade rumors and the email situation was with him.
*  You have the smart situation where various points this year,
*  White and Brogdon were just playing way better than him.
*  And Missoula I think was really afraid to not have smart be the crunch time guy
*  that manifested itself in the Hawks series.
*  Now White's not playing well.
*  Have you noticed that part?
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever is going on with that White, Brogdon, smart thing, it's now affecting White
*  and White is starting to look like 2022 finals, White a little bit.
*  I was going to say round one White of last year.
*  Remember round one?
*  Yeah.
*  It was like, is he playable in these?
*  He was too timid.
*  He wasn't physical.
*  After round one of last year, he kind of became that guy.
*  Then it veered back the other way.
*  That whole, those three guys that Brogdon finishes crunch time yesterday,
*  but White was the third best player in the team this year.
*  So you have that and then the Rob, Al Horford, how much do we get out of Rob?
*  And then the Grant Williams thing is also weird.
*  She doesn't play anymore.
*  They've waved the White flag it seems on Grant Williams.
*  What I was hearing when I was in Boston was when Grant wasn't playing in that Atlanta series was,
*  well, he's going to play against Philly when Embiid's out there.
*  He can be another body to throw at him.
*  He can space the floor when Embiid's out there.
*  So maybe if Embiid comes back, we'll see more out of Grant Williams.
*  The Jalen stuff that you mentioned, like unquestionably from what I was told,
*  the Kevin Durant trade rumors from last summer bothered Jalen a lot more than previous trade
*  rumors did because look, it's understandable.
*  He just led the team to the finals.
*  He was probably the Celtics best player in the finals.
*  And now we're back to this where you're going to trade me even for a player,
*  the caliber of Kevin Durant.
*  And nobody coming out and saying, hey, those rumors are bullshit.
*  We're not trading Jalen Brown.
*  And look, from what I was told, this was something, these were fires,
*  a fire I should say that Brad Stevens and Emey O'Dolk at the time had to put out.
*  This was something they had to address with him specifically.
*  The stuff with Jason, previous iterations of the Celtics coaching staff would
*  joke with me a little bit about this.
*  Your turn, my turn stuff was most prevalent in January,
*  when both these guys were trying to make All-Star team.
*  They both wanted to be on it.
*  But usually after the All-Star voting came out, they would be much more on the same page.
*  I think there's truth to that because if you look at, especially last season,
*  they seem to be, at least in the Eastern Conference playoffs,
*  in much better sync than they've been in years past.
*  But now you're right, game one at least was, it's the Jason Tatum show in this one.
*  And Jalen's going to get his shots in transition every so often,
*  but not be proactive in chasing it.
*  Again, he took 20 shots per game in that Hawks series, 20 shots.
*  And he took half that in game one.
*  He doesn't have to be 20, 25 every night, but he's got to be between 15 and 20 for this team,
*  I think, to have the kind of balance it needs to beat a good team like Philadelphia.
