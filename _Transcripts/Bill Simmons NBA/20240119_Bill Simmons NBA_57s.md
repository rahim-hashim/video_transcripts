# The Warriors Would NEVER Trade Steph but ... #billsimmons #shorts #stephencurry #nba #warriors
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8hMaxQYsBI)
*  What happens if Charlotte calls them and Godfather offers them for Steph?
*  Let's talk it out. What if they offered Lamello? Hayward's expiring and they offered them four
*  unprotected firsts. Now you say, why did Charlotte do that? Well, Charlotte's been a disaster as a
*  basketball franchise, basically in any incarnation of it. Steph Curry from Charlotte, maybe you
*  promise him down the road, wink, wink, you'll get a piece of this team when you retire and you just
*  make a Mr. Charlotte. And then if you go and state you get a reboot with Lamello, the guy should take
*  it anyway in a bunch of firsts. Maybe it's not four firsts, maybe it's three firsts. What's the
*  offer that would make Golden State at least take a meeting? And I think it would be Lamello and four
*  firsts. They're not trading Steph. So when this gets aggregated, because this is the new world
*  we live in where they just aggregate a piece of something you said and not the actual context of
*  it, I do not think the Warriors are going to trade Steph Curry. My point is if Charlotte calls them,
*  I think they have a meeting at least. Where the hell are they going? What are they going to do
*  with Steph Curry for the next five years of his career? Anyway, that's how bad it's got for the
*  Warriors of making up Steph Curry trades.
