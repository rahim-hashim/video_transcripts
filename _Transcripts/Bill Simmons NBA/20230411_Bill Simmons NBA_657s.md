# Bill Simmons’s 2023 All-NBA Teams | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ)
*  All right. So first team on B I had imbede, Yanis, Tatum, SGA and uh, Mitchell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I have the same thing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=9.48s)]
*  Mitchell had an awesome stat season. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=13.8s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=16.64s)]
*  But 48, 38, 87 splits for him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=18.04s)]
*  Like pretty. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=21.92s)]
*  And I think he was just so important to. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=22.36s)]
*  Swagger wise. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=25.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=27.32s)]
*  I, you know, it was tough between that and Luca. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=27.84s)]
*  It really was like, cause then I was like, it's not like I'm voting Luca MVP here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=31.24s)]
*  Uh, the stats are incredible, but I couldn't do it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=35.76s)]
*  The way Dallas finished the season, I could not put him on first team. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=41.76s)]
*  And you know, my feeling about losing records and on BA, like you really have [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  to have a special season for me to even consider you, um, SGA did not have a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  winning season, but you know, the records were fucked up this year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  They made the playing game, whatever. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=57.2s)]
*  Luca had no way he was going on my first team. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  I put him second team. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=61.0s)]
*  I cheated a little bit though. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=62.52s)]
*  I have him at forward. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=64.56s)]
*  I put a Yokeage, Jimmy Butler and Luca as my forwards because I [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=65.84s)]
*  think Luca's a fucking forward. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=70.2s)]
*  I don't care that he dribbles the ball up and the offense runs through him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=71.48s)]
*  He's a big doughy guy who doesn't guard guards in the other team. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=74.56s)]
*  It's Yokeage brings the ball up for Denver and we consider him a center. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=78.48s)]
*  Like to me, Luca's a forward. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=81.88s)]
*  It's stupid anyway. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=83.2s)]
*  And then, uh, I had Darren Fox and drew holiday as my second team guards. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=84.72s)]
*  And I'm probably shooting a team high and drew, and I don't care. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=91.0s)]
*  People can fuck off. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  So I have Lucas second, I have Fox second team, Butler. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=96.6s)]
*  Like when you look at the Butler stuff, like two years ago, when he [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=101.44s)]
*  was a third team argument, I ended up going with them, but I went, man, it's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  like, it feels a little cheating cause he played less games. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=108.72s)]
*  And so a lot of the metrics were awesome, but, um, but now we, this year [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=111.64s)]
*  he played a lot and they were even better. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=116.0s)]
*  I mean, the one thing with Butler, whether it's Atlanta or whoever gets [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=118.64s)]
*  Miami in the playoff series, like you have to tell your defenders to be more [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=121.64s)]
*  disciplined on his up fake shit around the rim, cause he gets the call all the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=125.56s)]
*  time, look at his free throw rate this year. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=128.6s)]
*  So that led to a big spike in his efficiency and he shot it from three, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  even though it isn't shoot it very often. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=133.6s)]
*  He shot it better than he generally has in the past. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=135.32s)]
*  35% nine free throws a game almost this year, 53% shooting. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=138.56s)]
*  Like his number, his clutch numbers are great. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=143.84s)]
*  He was really good and I didn't think that team was very good. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=145.96s)]
*  No, they weren't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=148.92s)]
*  So he was a no brainer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=149.52s)]
*  Uh, the only cheating I did here is I put Anthony Davis, second [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=151.4s)]
*  team forward, I put Yoko Center. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=154.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, to me, that's not nearly as bad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=159.4s)]
*  Like Luca, Luca doesn't play forward. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=161.0s)]
*  He's not a guard. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=166.4s)]
*  He sure looks like a guy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  What, what guard does he go? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=170.4s)]
*  Would you have him guarding drew holiday? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=172.56s)]
*  I wouldn't have him guarding doc holiday. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=178.6s)]
*  If I could get away with it, but he doesn't, he doesn't guard guards. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, here's, here's why I put him at forward because I knew I wanted to have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=183.48s)]
*  a Nick and unless Luca was at forward, I had to pick Julius Randall over Brunson. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=189.44s)]
*  And I just think Brunson was the most important Nick this year. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  I actually don't even think it's really an argument and putting Luca forward [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=199.44s)]
*  allowed me to put Brunson in at 13 guard, which is really what I cared about. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  And not have Randall. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  I know Randall stats are great. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  I know he's had some good games, but it's not, not totally my type of guy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=211.24s)]
*  Um, I respected the season, but if I have a choice with him and Brunson, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=216.96s)]
*  I'd rather reward Brunson. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=220.68s)]
*  The clutch stuff with Brunson was nuts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=221.68s)]
*  The way that he changed the demeanor of that team, um, was really special. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Like he, that was a really fucked up franchise that especially end of games. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  And he just, he just something about what he did for them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=234.96s)]
*  I almost don't even think you can put in stats. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  So I had for third time, I had some bonus. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=241.08s)]
*  I had Jalen Brown. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  I have LeBron James. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  I have Jalen Brunson. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=247.08s)]
*  I have Steph Curry. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=252.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=252.64s)]
*  We've got some difference. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=252.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=254.44s)]
*  I figured the third team was hard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  So we both have Steph. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  We both have Jalen Brown. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=261.32s)]
*  Uh, we both have some bonus. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=264.08s)]
*  Some bonus is the layup on this one. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=265.4s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=267.28s)]
*  The Jalen stuff, his, his metrics are bad. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  He didn't get to the free throw line enough. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=272.2s)]
*  Um, and then turns it over too much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=273.76s)]
*  But if you think about how long the list has to be of guys, Hey, we need, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=275.76s)]
*  we need a bucket right now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=280.44s)]
*  The list is not that long, uh, before you get to Jalen Brown. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=282.64s)]
*  Like that's just how good he was, especially when like everybody else sucked [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=286.24s)]
*  and like Tatum had some big counting stretches there for a few weeks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Like Jalen was kind of the guy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=292.44s)]
*  So it's still the second best team in the NBA. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=294.52s)]
*  I have no problem with putting Jalen down on there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=297.32s)]
*  This is where you're probably going to push back a little bit. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=299.76s)]
*  I felt like it guard at this point. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=301.96s)]
*  Wait, can we, can we hold on Jalen for one second? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=304.28s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  Cause there's some on-off stuff with him that, that I think is the way you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=307.44s)]
*  ding it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=311.08s)]
*  If you're saying like, no, no, he actually wasn't on BA. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=311.52s)]
*  Look at the on-off metrics, all that stuff. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=313.64s)]
*  First of all, their bench was awesome. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's always going to skew the on-off metrics the same way. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  Like Denver's bench was not good. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  So Yokech looks even better when he's on off. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=322.76s)]
*  Um, I just think Boston was the second best team in the league. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  And the biggest reason was because of those two guys. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  And if Tatum didn't have it one night, Brown always had a way of stepping up. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=333.36s)]
*  Like he's just. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=337.56s)]
*  The two guys together were the Celtics and then the role players, but every team [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=339.11999999999995s)]
*  they had to play, it was a huge game for the other team. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=343.08s)]
*  And you got to carry that for six months. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=346.11999999999995s)]
*  And those two guys are the ones that carried it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=348.0s)]
*  They got a pretty crappy Marcus smart season, you know? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=350.2s)]
*  And I think, I think, uh, the fact that white was able to step up really helped [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=353.32s)]
*  them, but Rob didn't play really at all. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=358.08s)]
*  They couldn't count on him the whole year. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=360.28s)]
*  Corford, they started really being careful with the last two months of the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=362.32s)]
*  season, but Brown, uh, Brown and Tatum are the constants. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=365.04s)]
*  And I really think it's important with the OMBA to have the two guys from [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  the two best teams, if you can do it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  That's why I wanted a holiday and, and Jaylen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=374.12s)]
*  So, all right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  So what was your third, your third team guard that we disagreed on? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=377.56s)]
*  Dame. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=382.68s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=384.44s)]
*  I didn't love it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=386.44s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not against it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=387.16s)]
*  But the team sat him down and his off seat, his offensive season's like [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  incredible and since the team's the one that shut him down, I felt like I was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=395.28s)]
*  digging something really special by not putting them on third team where that's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=400.76s)]
*  where the Brunson part of this kind of sucked and then I didn't know what to do [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  with Randall and then my last forward spot, I went with Larry Markkinen, uh, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=407.88s)]
*  because that team wanted them to lose towards the end and we're sitting him down. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=411.55999999999995s)]
*  He was so fucking good this year. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  He's my most improved player too, over Shea, just cause I feel like with [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  Larry, I wasn't sure what it was going to be. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  Hey, nice player, make some threes, you know, it's good size or whatever. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=423.6s)]
*  And now it's like, holy shit, this guy's going to be a max dude and was the go-to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  guy on a team that was exceeding expectations for what 80% of the season. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  Uh, once Utah tried to, you know, recalculate what their expectations [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=438.76000000000005s)]
*  were here for the rest of it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, this is again, where you, you have some standards, you're way more [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=443.36s)]
*  married to the one loss record thing than I am when it comes to the third team stuff. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  Where I just think I personally think it's LeBron. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=451.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, he was really good when he had the right people around him. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=458.2s)]
*  Um, he got to my 55 game limit and I just felt like, I mean, I was, I was [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=462.92s)]
*  Um, he got to my 55 game limit and I just felt like he's one of the best [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=468.92s)]
*  forwards in the league, right? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=474.68s)]
*  KD was the one I had the biggest struggle with. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=475.64s)]
*  I was like, do I actually break all my rules and put it, is it his fault that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=477.88s)]
*  he got hurt twice, but 47 is just not enough. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=483.32s)]
*  The Dame thing, he only played 58 games. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=486.12s)]
*  I just feel like most of the games that he played didn't really matter. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=489.24s)]
*  That wasn't a good team. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=493.08s)]
*  I think we, this was reminding me of the Beal wizard season when Beal got 30 [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=495.08s)]
*  a game and it was like, that team was never good. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=498.91999999999996s)]
*  And if you are a really good score and you want to score a lot of points on a [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=501.4s)]
*  team that's going nowhere, you can do it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=505.4s)]
*  It's 71 against the Rockets. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  It's 60 against Utah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=510.11999999999995s)]
*  Um, I just couldn't get there with it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=512.52s)]
*  I think if he had played 65, 66, maybe I'd start thinking about it, but I don't know. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=515.48s)]
*  The team's going to finish 33 and 49. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=521.9599999999999s)]
*  So I couldn't get there. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=524.28s)]
*  I just felt there were better choices. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=525.88s)]
*  The shocker for me was how easily I just knocked Ja off the team. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=527.48s)]
*  Ja was I think first team OMBA before all this stuff went down. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=532.76s)]
*  He ended up only playing 60 games and, uh, I didn't really consider him. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=535.64s)]
*  I thought Dame was the hardest out of all of these. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=540.12s)]
*  Um, and maybe Randall, but I just, I couldn't get there with Randall. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=544.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=550.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=551.72s)]
*  I can't believe like even when Ja was coming back, I was like, well, you know, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=551.88s)]
*  what are you, what are you going to do here? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=556.76s)]
*  But the guard thing got really crowded, man. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=557.88s)]
*  You know, I don't feel good about leaving Brunson off. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=561.32s)]
*  Uh, you know, the Drew part of it, uh, you're giving him a massive bump for the all NBA [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=563.1600000000001s)]
*  and maybe you're right about that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=568.84s)]
*  I didn't really, you know, like Ja had a hard time with, I know some people [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=570.12s)]
*  probably floated the Kawhi stuff out there as well. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=573.08s)]
*  Uh, that wasn't that hard for me to leave them off. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=576.76s)]
*  Personally, I actually thought for me, the second team drew is surprisingly easy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=580.36s)]
*  And I know I'm, I'm a huge fan of his. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=586.84s)]
*  I get it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=588.76s)]
*  But I just love watching that dude play defense. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=589.8s)]
*  I feel like when a, when a guard has a big game against them and Drew's trying to shut [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=593.56s)]
*  the guy down and the guy's putting up points anyway, you almost like have to rank the game [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  higher for the guy who did that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=603.0s)]
*  I'm just always so impressed by all this stuff. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=605.0s)]
*  Drew does. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=607.24s)]
*  I feel like he's the big Kahuna right now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=607.72s)]
*  Like if you're a guard and you're going against him, you better fucking bring it, you know? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=611.48s)]
*  And offensively, I really liked the stuff he did this year. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=615.32s)]
*  I thought he had an excellent season. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=617.96s)]
*  All the metrics were great with him. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=619.88s)]
*  Um, he played enough games and to me, that was a pretty easy one. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=622.12s)]
*  The crazy one for me is Fox who, you know, I know we knew this was coming, but just what [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=626.6s)]
*  a, what a turnaround from a guy 18 months ago. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=631.48s)]
*  I thought like, ugh, what is this guy? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=634.36s)]
*  Is this, I think we had him on worst contracts maybe, or maybe on the bubble. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=636.84s)]
*  You did. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=640.76s)]
*  I did. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=640.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=641.6400000000001s)]
*  I just never could get there with him, but he, uh, he flipped it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuxGqXDAiQ&t=642.84s)]
