# The Porzingis Game! Celtics Take Game 1 of the NBA Finals | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erOYgUvVCiU)
*  What is your first takeaway from Celtics 107, Dallas 89, other than it was the typical rollercoaster ride that the Celtics team has been on where we ran the game of emotions and then somehow won by 18?
*  My impression sitting there was our defense was really good. And that was led, I think, by Holliday. I thought he was all over the place. And Jalen Brown, I thought, played very good defense as well.
*  I thought we did a good job on Dantrek, even though he scored his points, but he really had to work for them. And I thought Kyrie had the typical game he's had recently in Boston in the playoffs. I thought he didn't play well. I mean, we did a good job on him.
*  Six for 19, 0 for 5 from 3.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the two guys that jumped out to me drew Holliday and Porzingis.
*  Yeah, drew Holliday and Porzingis. They won the game. I will say, though, I thought Tatum had a poor game, but he played 42 minutes. I mean, he was there.
*  And rebounded and did stuff.
*  He had maybe 10 rebounds, something like that. And I thought Jalen Brown played a very hard game.
*  Yeah.
*  His shot just wasn't falling at times. But he also must have played more than 40 minutes. So they put their time in. It's great that we don't have to play until Sunday. So Mozzola was able to keep them out there. I didn't want to see either one of them come out for defensive purposes.
*  Well, let's go with Drew first, because this is one of those you kind of had to be there. I'm sure it came across on TV, too. But he was the alpha of the game for the Celtics. There's this moment. They're up 28 with two minutes left in the second quarter.
*  And the crowd is delirious. I would say that was a 10 out of 10 crowd in the first half, right?
*  Until two minutes left in the half.
*  Yep. Yeah, there was Brown got nailed on a pick, got knocked down. Dallas ended up and it just kind of changed the energy of the game. And then Dallas had a couple of shots. We had some bad positions at the tail end. All of a sudden it was 21 instead of 28 going in the half.
*  And the crowd was like, oh, second half starts. Dallas is awesome coming out of the gate and Lucas doing Lucas stuff. And Joe called timeout early with like eight minutes left in the third. All of a sudden it was 14. Then it got to eight.
*  And I that was the first playoff game I've been to in the Drew era. Drew is the alpha on the court. He was the alpha in the timeouts. And he was I thought Tatum looked a little like, oh, God, what's going on?
*  Brown was ever since he got hit by that pick, he seemed a little just a tiny bit off weight. You know, he's a quiet guy. But I thought Drew was all over the place. And then he was just like, whoever I'm guarding is not scoring. And he took over Luca. And that was it for Luca.
*  He had Irving for a while and then he took over Luca. And he made Luca a passer because Luca just couldn't get by him.
*  Luca a passer who had no assist. Luca had one assist. And that was one of the things. Dallas only had nine assists in that game.
*  You know, I can't even remember a regular season game, let alone a playoff game where the team had a playoff team had nine assists, less than double digit assists.
*  Yeah. And we were watching it. I don't think we really noticed till deep in the second half where we're like, there's a lot of one on one stuff and a lot of people passing because at the last minute they couldn't get the shot they wanted.
*  Well, you said something to me too. The alley oop isn't working for them.
*  Yeah. Porzingis especially took the alley oop away.
*  You know, Porzingis, what a difference maker in that first half. And not only that, he got the crowd. The crowd was standing in that first half.
*  The crowd was into it anyway.
*  Into it anyway. And you know, the thing about Porzingis, every time he goes up for rebound, you get scared that he's going to come down the wrong way.
*  Yeah, because he had that stretch in the in the first half when he was just out of his mind.
*  Blocking shots.
*  48-27 and he has 15 points.
*  There's halfway through the second quarter.
*  He's six for eight and he was just all over the place.
*  And that was like a little before that.
*  He had the three. He had the block.
*  Hauser hit a three.
*  And that was like the crowd got supercharged.
*  I think he had his three blocks in the first half.
*  Second half, he looked not quite as sharp.
*  They took him out.
*  They changed how they were defending him too.
*  They did, yeah.
*  It seemed like they were being a little more careful.
*  Drew in the first half was mostly, you know, we're doing this live.
*  I was I was I don't take notes when we're actually watching the game.
*  I try to take notes from time out, but I felt like Drew was on Kyrie a lot.
*  And then at some point in the third quarter, it became Drew on Luca.
*  And it was interesting watching Luca because normally he just brings the ball up.
*  But Drew was like, I'm I'm going 94 feet with you.
*  You're going to have to bring it up on me.
*  And Luca was like, who wants to take this up a few times?
*  Well, when you and I talked on the phone yesterday, you pointed out that we'll play
*  them differently than Minnesota did, right?
*  We'll we'll hand them bringing the ball up.
*  And that's exactly what Holliday did.
*  And White does that also.
*  Yeah. And and it also it had an impact of Dallas getting into their offense with
*  fewer seconds left in the 24 second clock.
*  Well, a couple of things happened in that first.
*  I mean, the K.P. it was so funny when we were talking about it.
*  I got there super early and was talking to a bunch of people about it.
*  I was pretty confident heading into this
*  series, but trying not to be too confident on the podcast, because, who knows,
*  K.P. could go down five seconds from now,
*  but it was almost like people forgot how good he was because he hadn't played in a
*  while and from everything I heard talking to people today before the game,
*  like he was going to play Game five Indiana.
*  I think he actually could have played
*  Game four Indiana if it was too much that he almost did.
*  Yeah. So he so 10 days ago,
*  he could play it so he knew he was going to come out.
*  And then the other thing was like, well,
*  it's going to take him a while to get used to it.
*  It took him one second to miss this first shot, I think.
*  And then he went crazy.
*  But you've watched them all year and you've
*  been texting me and you've been going to a lot of these games because that was a
*  typical K.P. game that was it was a typical K.P. game and the kind of playoff game we
*  didn't have last year because we didn't have that guy in the middle.
*  Right.
*  And it wasn't just offense.
*  How many shots in that first half that
*  did he change the direction of when Dallas was near the basket?
*  At least half dozen.
*  Yeah, he came in.
*  It was 12, 11.
*  We were two frayed from three and all of a sudden it was 37, 20.
*  And he had blocked a couple of shots and he had changed a couple of shots and
*  just completely took their lobs away,
*  which was a huge part of how they won the last three rounds.
*  I thought his defense was a huge factor in the way that Kyrie Irving played.
*  Because Kyrie does the lobs.
*  Kyrie goes in for the crazy layups.
*  Porzingis was all over the place near the basket.
*  And then, of course, he changes things when
*  Dallas is on defense because they can't have a center just standing under the basket.
*  Right. They have to come out.
*  Well, it seemed like one of the decisions they made, I don't know how intentional it
*  was, but they were trying to put smaller guys on them so they could still protect
*  the rim. And he was like super insulted by it.
*  They had Luker on him quite a few times.
*  Yeah. And they had,
*  I mean, all their six foot seven.
*  Hardy was on him once.
*  Jones was on him.
*  Yeah, Jones was on him.
*  But one time in the timeout, he kind of stared down their bench.
*  I don't know if they caught it on TV, but it was after like the fifth time he had a
*  15 footer and he just kind of looked over their bench like, really?
*  Yeah. This is this is your game plan in this one.
*  But it's what we talked about.
*  If they put their center on him beyond the foul line,
*  well, we noticed it right away.
*  They got great.
*  They got there was a huge rebound difference in the first half.
*  Yeah, they caught up a little bit.
*  Well, yeah, they weren't getting they only got 10 offensive rebounds.
*  And one thing that I thought was notable was
*  so I wrote down 58, 33, 250 up in the second quarter, but I wrote down no centers
*  for Dallas, which I think had happened a couple of minutes earlier.
*  They went small.
*  But in the in the last couple of series,
*  like and part of it was because they didn't have Cuba.
*  But they always had centers and that was such a big the lobs on offense.
*  And then the rim protection was a big reason why they won.
*  The Celtics kind of took that away when they made their comeback in the in the
*  third quarter was small ball for at least a little bit, I think.
*  You know, having been to so many games
*  during the season, we have a consistent problem at the end of the half.
*  The last two, two and a half minutes, I don't know what happens.
*  The energy died, the crowd and then the
*  beginning of the third quarter, too, because people aren't back in their seats.
*  Back in the seats.
*  And I don't know what, you know, what
*  coaching could have done differently the last two and a half minutes.
*  But we look you said it to me.
*  We look tired.
*  It was, you know, it was a pretty emotional game.
*  Like even the crowd was really into it from the moment Porzingis came out of the tunnel.
*  You were in the bathroom.
*  It was one of your five P breaks.
*  Yeah.
*  But Porzingis came out and the crowd was
*  like, acting like Willis Reed was coming out of the tunnel.
*  Right.
*  And then the Bill Walton thing before the game, which was great.
*  Very, very silent for him.
*  They play a video for him.
*  So that was emotional.
*  Plus all the Celtics had Walton shirts on.
*  Right.
*  That was neat.
*  Yeah, which was I kind of want one of those.
*  But so the crowd's nuts for that.
*  Then we went go on that run in the first quarter and the crowd for about a half hour was standing.
*  Go nuts.
*  We ended the first quarter, 37 to 20, 17 points.
*  Got it to 48, 27.
*  Got it to 58, 33.
*  And Porzingis said that one play he was.
*  Honestly, looked like a video game
*  character that like my son would have created.
*  He had that one play when he just on defense was flying down the other way,
*  trying to block somebody from behind and just jumped.
*  And I was like, oh, my God.
*  Like, well, you and I were both saying,
*  I'm not sure if I want him jumping in the air.
*  Well, it's funny watching it next.
*  We haven't gone to a playoff game together.
*  You were every time he went up in the air, you made a noise.
*  One of your dogs was trying to cross the street or something.
*  You're like, oh, oh, no.
*  It is terrifying.
*  It is.
*  And
*  you know, you got a good look at how thin his legs are.
*  Yeah.
*  I just hope he survives Celtics and six.
*  He looked great.
*  I was watching him really carefully in the warmups.
*  They're really, really diligent about when he's not playing.
*  Like, at one point he was on, I think, the bike.
*  He was in the tunnel at halftime.
*  He was stepping on that little calf thing.
*  But I thought he moved.
*  I think it's like the fifth or sixth time I've seen them in the person.
*  I thought he was moving great.
*  I also thought at least one thing I thought Missoula did well tonight.
*  Whenever Dallas took their big guys out, either of the two guys, he took Bozingis out.
*  Yeah. Well, and then the other thing was
*  he had Drew lined up with Kyrie and Kyrie came out.
*  He immediately took Drew out.
*  Kyrie came back and he immediately put Drew back in and was just trying to.
*  Drew is I just can't believe Milwaukee traded that guy.
*  And I've always loved him.
*  And anyone who's listening to this podcast, I was like always riding for Drew.
*  Anytime I did trade value, I always had him ten spots higher than he probably
*  should have been, but I just I value what that guy does so much.
*  When you see it in person and people look at his stats and be like, oh, did he?
*  He's like ten point seven rebounds five assists.
*  He was the dominant guy.
*  If you watch the game and you pick up the newspaper tomorrow, you look online
*  at the stats, you'll say, oh, Drew had a mediocre game.
*  Right.
*  And you have to be there or you have to be watching carefully on TV.
*  Yeah, I was texting Doc about it and Doc Rivers and Doc said his value is not
*  what is seen, it's the unseen that makes him special.
*  And I really felt that at the game, watching all the little stuff that he does.
*  Coming out of timeouts, how
*  you know, like Dallas Dallas has taken the ball into their basket after time out or
*  foul or whatever, and he just kind of walks all the way up
*  and he's staring Luca down the whole time.
*  It's like, I'm here.
*  It's almost like watching a boxer.
*  I just love watching.
*  I do think putting aside what did Luca have 30 points?
*  Yeah.
*  He didn't have a winning or productive 30 points.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, it was a lot of one on one stuff all the way around.
*  Obviously, if they had nine assists.
*  Yeah.
*  With that said, it reminded me, I think it was game two of the O8 Lakers-Selfick
*  Series when we had a better team with the Lakers and it was pretty clear.
*  Sorry, I'm saying we for everybody listening, but it was my dad.
*  We just say we.
*  But Kobe had this stretch.
*  I think it was game two.
*  We hadn't played well, but then he kind of took over the game
*  for like six minutes in the fourth quarter and he tilted the crowd.
*  Where the crowd was like, oh, God, what's what's this guy doing?
*  And Luca had one three in the third quarter where you could that, oh, God,
*  that feeling was in there when they cut it to eight.
*  They cut it to eight with the ball and felt like they were nervous.
*  Yeah, they felt like they were going to tie the game.
*  So this Celtics team.
*  Which we text a lot about, we talk on the phone a lot and you're at.
*  Pretty much all of these, any of the big
*  games, but you went to a lot of the games this year and this team.
*  Which always seems to be up by 20 at some point of every game they play until
*  and then something happens and all of a sudden you feel like they're down 30.
*  Meanwhile, they're up 15 and it just feels like the sky is falling.
*  And then they'll hit a shot.
*  And but what's interesting when you're in the building for it,
*  the crowd kind of senses when it's going to happen, when when the game's tilting
*  and all of a sudden you feel these nerves and it's like just the nerves of a fan base
*  that's watched a lot of these games, right?
*  When these guys, when it got down to eight, it was a really quiet crowd time out.
*  And it was like, yeah, and just everybody
*  looking at each other going, what the fuck just happened?
*  We're 28. They want to have 29 or nine run the maps.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But so you've been there a lot for that, where they've looked awesome.
*  Well, for me, a couple of consistent things happen when we have when we give up
*  that kind of run, we seem to stop moving the ball.
*  Right. Everything gets slower.
*  We go isolation.
*  Yeah. And we're taking three point after three point after three point shot.
*  And they weren't going in during that stretch.
*  And Tatum, Tatum had rebounds.
*  He had some assists.
*  As you said, he had six turnovers, but he had a bizarre game.
*  Well, he had I mean, how many times did he drive to the basket?
*  And it seems like he could have done the Dr.
*  J swoop layup five times and then he was kicking it back out or trying to thread a
*  little pass to Horford and three three of the times it led to turnovers.
*  He threw it out of bounds. It's six turnovers.
*  Yeah.
*  Why he can't finish is really puzzling.
*  Or why he didn't realize he could finish was almost more of the question.
*  It's like it felt like over and over again, he had layup.
*  What was interesting about what the
*  Mavs did, and especially when they were coming back, the refs were letting everything go.
*  It was a really physical game.
*  Well, can I just cut in there?
*  Yeah, we won the game.
*  You're going to complain about the refs?
*  I thought they were terrible.
*  I thought they were awful.
*  Yeah, Tatum got mauled a couple of times.
*  You know, a couple of times, Brown got killed.
*  Yeah, I just want to mention they had 16,000.
*  We had 15, but I know I know you felt like they had four times as many files.
*  I felt I felt that we didn't get a fair shake from the refs.
*  Luca definitely got a couple of calls.
*  And it's funny, I thought the crowd was going to be by the end of the game.
*  We hate Luca the most, but.
*  No, they were in the second half.
*  It was like Kyrie wasn't playing well, and the crowd was really, really saving it.
*  We had that one guy about two rows behind us, because we're in row three.
*  So we're pretty close.
*  He was vicious on Kyrie Irving.
*  He was like, not like over the line vicious, but he was just kind of riding.
*  He wasn't swearing.
*  No.
*  So Kyrie, you suck.
*  You can't make a shot.
*  Kyrie, you suck.
*  You have 11 points.
*  You have 11.
*  Three for 19.
*  Kyrie.
*  And did you see Kyrie looking at him?
*  Yeah.
*  And Kyrie did a smile.
*  And you know what's funny?
*  I actually liked how Kyrie played in that game, except for his shots weren't going
*  in, but that was the best defensively I've ever seen him play in person.
*  And he was I didn't even notice him.
*  No, but he was doing like he was trying to get steals.
*  He was just really active.
*  Yeah, he was trying to get.
*  But sometimes he backfired on him.
*  He had seven or eight fouls that weren't called.
*  Well, that's but he was taking advantage of it.
*  It reminded me of like those Chris Paul
*  Kuiper games they used to go to where he would just from the first minute he's
*  just mauling everybody and saying, you're either calling or not calling it.
*  But that was by far the most aggressive I've seen him.
*  I just thought his shot wasn't going in.
*  They missed.
*  Luca missed some shots around the basket.
*  Kyrie missed a couple wide open trees that he usually makes.
*  K.P. made a huge difference around the basket.
*  Yeah, true.
*  Because they were seven for twenty seven from three with nine assists.
*  So if you just told me those two things, I would be like Dallas lost.
*  Right. And Dallas has in the playoffs has been a good three point shooting team.
*  Yeah, a couple of things that made me feel.
*  You know, the history of these things is the home team looks awesome in game one.
*  Like we beat Golden State in twenty two and I always worry about game.
*  Yeah. And then game two, there's adjustments.
*  But what was interesting to me about Dallas in this game?
*  First of all, they played hard away who really was buried the whole playoffs.
*  He was hurt. Oh, no, he was hurt.
*  He was hurt. But then he came back.
*  He played the last game. That was it.
*  But they played.
*  I guess Exum came in late, but he played ten guys like he was kind of
*  I felt like he was kind of trying to see who made sense, which was weird because
*  it felt like they had such a good identity coming out of the last round.
*  Exum played in garbage time, didn't he?
*  But he usually played for them.
*  Like Hardaway played over him.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Jaden Hardy was another one that he only played 11 minutes.
*  He's a trick or treat guy.
*  But they kind of needed him in this game because they were down.
*  But the P.J. Washington, who was 0 for 3, I'm sure the OKC fans are watching this.
*  Washington was 0 for 3, 0 for 3 from 3.
*  He was 5 for 11.
*  But but he missed all his threes.
*  And normally he's a corner three guy.
*  But the Celts were kind of moving it.
*  So he was open on the top of the game.
*  We covered the corner well.
*  Yeah.
*  So his his threes were.
*  At the top, but if I'm Dallas, what was Lucas threes?
*  Luke was 4 for 12, OK, 10 rebounds.
*  Where does he rank for you?
*  Scariest guys you've seen in person.
*  Well, I watched I watched all the Western playoff games.
*  I thought he I didn't think this was one
*  of his good games compared to having watched him in the other three series,
*  despite how many points he scored.
*  He wasn't scary tonight because we really guarded him well.
*  Well, that's why I didn't understand how people are discussing the series where,
*  listen, if they're going to they're not going to shoot this badly in game two and
*  probably have a good chance to win, but we just match up pretty well with this team.
*  Like we have big dudes throw it, Luca, and we have really good guards to throw Kyrie
*  and with Porzingis real rim protection.
*  And then the other thing like Jaylen had two big blocks in the second half.
*  Right. How they and White always end up getting blocks around the rim.
*  Horford always gets a block.
*  Tatum will get like they protect the rim really well.
*  And I felt like people are forgetting that piece.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Derek White is one of the best guards protecting the rim.
*  You know, it's going to be interesting
*  the adjustments that are made because I'm sure Dallas didn't expect that kind
*  of Porzingis game, right? Well, how could they?
*  We didn't expect it. We didn't.
*  And it was obvious the game plan was to take Tatum out of the game.
*  All right. So what do you do in game two?
*  I'm hoping and expecting a big Tatum game
*  because I think they're going to make adjustments to take to not let Porzingis
*  hurt them so badly.
*  He was really unselfish in the first quarter, which I didn't mind.
*  And he was trying to set people up.
*  And we've seen him do that before in these games this year where and then
*  in the second quarter, all of a sudden we'll have 15.
*  Right.
*  I thought that was going to happen this game and it just didn't.
*  Well, it could have because you said it earlier.
*  He got to the rim five or six times.
*  And then it was I felt like it was like 10 or and then passed out.
*  He didn't used to do that.
*  I'm not sure what's going on there.
*  Maybe they felt like that was an inefficiency.
*  They're trying to or they had open threes.
*  But that's fine.
*  If you're making the threes, we weren't making them so much in the second half.
*  Did you feel like like for the people listening, you haven't seen a ton of the
*  Celtics, did you feel like that was a typical regular season Celtics?
*  Like what you saw?
*  Yeah, because to me that looked like that's what we watched all year.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  With maybe the slight exception that taking the big lead like we did in the first
*  quarter.
*  But how many times have we blown big leads like that and where it all of a sudden
*  will be 12 and then they'll get it back up.
*  But I just didn't expect it in the playoff game.
*  That's all. Yeah, true.
*  Or in the finals game.
*  Finals game.
*  I guess the one if you're looking at.
*  If you're looking at dark points for the Celtics.
*  Prichard was 0 for 7 and every minute he was in the game was terrifying because
*  it just Luca was just Luca was like a cheetah in the wild,
*  noticing the stray buck.
*  He's like, where is that guy?
*  And same for Kyrie.
*  I defend Prichard, though.
*  He I thought he shot well most of the season.
*  He had good looks and they just didn't go in.
*  Wow.
*  But on the house, they made a couple of those.
*  How's made a couple on defense?
*  I'm not sure Prichard could go out anybody in that team.
*  Well, definitely not the two best guys.
*  How's had one or two good Luka possessions where he actually stayed in front of them.
*  I thought in general, I really liked how they guarded Luka.
*  And it almost seemed like they were trying.
*  They kept trying to force Luca and Kyrie to the middle where they had the rim
*  protection. And even if those guys were getting by them, they were kind of OK with it.
*  They were just everything was about steering them into the paint,
*  which I thought was smart.
*  Well, I mean, Dallas did not have its lob game.
*  We took that away and Dallas did not have its open three point shots in the corner.
*  We took that away and they've been Washington's been very efficient in the corner.
*  Yeah, it certainly wasn't tonight.
*  I love the adjustments from Game 1 to Game 2,
*  but we're going to make adjustments, too.
*  And I like, I especially like the fact that Orford gets that extra night of rest.
*  And so does Poisingas.
*  Yeah, I'm looking at they have the make misses.
*  On you could do the ESPN play by play.
*  I mean, they had it looks like they only had three corner threes.
*  There were one for three corner threes.
*  And if you look at the cluster here, look.
*  All the all the threes are top of the top of the key.
*  Basically, and they killed Minnesota with their corner threes.
*  Right. So we took those away.
*  Is it time to have an announcement?
*  Kyle turned the Tic Tac camera on, even though we're doing this weird zoom thing.
*  Is it time to promote Joe Missoula from second row Joe to first row Joe?
*  It's too early.
*  No, it's too early.
*  What do you mean?
*  He's 77 and 20.
*  Somehow the lead got down to eight.
*  We look terrible.
*  He called some good timeouts.
*  I'm going to defend. I'm going to first row Joe.
*  He's back.
*  Come on.
*  On Monday, on Sunday night, if we do a podcast after a second win,
*  you're not on Sunday's podcast.
*  I'm not on Sunday's.
*  No, it's Rossello night.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Then I guess I will.
*  You have to tell me in the seats.
*  I'm not ready to give Joe that movement.
*  I thought he did a good job today.
*  We defended Luca and Kyrie great.
*  I thought the way he drew was really smart.
*  It was.
*  I thought the way he not starting Porzingis turned out to be a good one
*  because he came in and changed the energy.
*  We got to our seats.
*  They post the starting lineup.
*  Yeah. And Horford starting.
*  And Porzingis also is not on the floor.
*  The whole team comes out there and nobody knows what's going on.
*  Where's Porzingis?
*  That was rough.
*  I forgot. I blocked that out of my mind.
*  That was a rough five minutes.
*  I would feel I would give Joe a B plus tonight.
*  A B plus.
*  We were up 28.
*  If he hadn't fallen asleep at the end of the half.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's a weird one because you never want to call time out with a minute left.
*  But we clearly something bad was happening and we could all see it.
*  We could all see it.
*  And they got the eight points down.
*  There were seven points down at the end.
*  I am officially retiring second row, Joe.
*  I think he's done a good job.
*  The team's 77 and 20.
*  Well, you're in a professional position where you have to smooth with these people now.
*  No, I don't care.
*  I can give my honest opinion for the fair for anybody listening.
*  He's way better than he was last year.
*  And the other thing, which I've noticed that other games, but especially that
*  Charles Lee, who I know the Celtics absolutely love him.
*  Charlotte's hired him.
*  And he's like right with them.
*  It reminds me of like Belichick with when he had like Josh McDaniels and they were
*  always together.
*  You know, having been to so many games this season,
*  the assistant coaches have made a huge difference for Missola.
*  And he has grown.
*  I mean, I'm being a little facetious.
*  I like that he was getting on the refs too today because Jaylen got Jason got killed
*  a couple of times and he was really mad.
*  Yeah, he was like screaming at them, which I don't feel like he was doing last year.
*  It looked like Cassell had to play mediator with the referees.
*  Yeah, I liked it. It was fiery.
*  Joe Mass.
*  I'm not calling him second row Joe anymore.
*  He's earned my respect.
*  Well, you never called him that anyway.
*  No, I did.
*  I called it because you were calling him second row Joe.
*  I think you should.
*  Well, maybe after game two or game three.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  Public apology.
*  Maybe after the series.
*  How's that?
*  Tough crowd watching that game, especially when we're up 28.
*  And I got flashbacks to 39 years ago, the Memorial Day massacre,
*  which we went to on a Sunday.
*  I thought the same thing.
*  I took the train from Connecticut.
*  We went to the game.
*  We beat that beat the Lakers by 180 points.
*  And we already counted that we had won the championship.
*  I took the train back and I was already trying to figure out
*  what I was going to get for the 85 championship poster for my room.
*  And we're going to go to the Duffport Parade.
*  Yeah.
*  Could I get back?
*  Should I leave school to try to come back?
*  And then game two, Kareem absolutely annihilated us.
*  We are always fearful of game two.
*  And obviously in two of the three
*  playoff rounds, the South's have lost game, too.
*  So
*  we do have an extra day of rest, which we didn't have in the last series
*  between one and two.
*  Well, one thing that was really noticeable in this game.
*  And I had said this all week.
*  They have five of the seven best guys in this series.
*  Yeah.
*  And Horford has a case for eight for being the sixth best guy out of the top eight.
*  Well, it's an interesting point because on all the TV shows, especially the NBA
*  show and ESPN, all they talk about their their premise is that Dallas has the two
*  best players in the in the series.
*  And they forget the whole team concept.
*  Well, also.
*  There's no statistical evidence for it.
*  I was talking about it on the other pods this week.
*  Jalen's averaging more points again than Kyrie in the playoffs, not only this year,
*  but for the last four years.
*  And like even tonight, Jalen wasn't.
*  You know, incredible, was efficient, but he had 22 and Kyrie had 12 because
*  and this happened in the Oklahoma City Series to him, too.
*  And they were I think he had a couple Kyrie had these games where he just has 11
*  points, they made him work.
*  They never really got him comfortable.
*  He wasn't getting the free throw line.
*  They weren't falling.
*  He has I mean, he's just an amazing basketball player to watch.
*  But he has so many different moves.
*  There was one time he had in front of the Celtic bench.
*  Corford came out and shut him down on a corner three.
*  And Kyrie led up for a second.
*  So Horford led up and then he just kind of went around him like a cat and just went
*  baseline on him. He did.
*  But if I recall, there was a period where Missoula had the two bigs out.
*  He had, yeah, Porzingis and Horford out at the same time.
*  Yeah, you got excited for that one.
*  Well, because I think that was an example where Kyrie got past Horford and there's
*  Porzingis waiting. Right.
*  And it makes a huge difference.
*  It's weird that.
*  I still don't know what Minnesota was doing last round against them.
*  I don't know why they didn't have Jaden
*  McDaniels on Kyrie the entire time.
*  Right. I don't know why they didn't play
*  Nas Reid more and try to have him on Luca.
*  I don't know why Gobert was so ineffective
*  in that series because Porzingis made such a difference with his.
*  Well, Gobert has no outside shot.
*  No, I'm just saying defensively.
*  Yeah, defensively.
*  The keys as good of a rim protector is Porzingis,
*  but Porzingis looked like Bill Russell, 7'3 Bill Russell.
*  That was another thing that made us feel good about this game and the set.
*  They do the heroes among us in the second quarter.
*  Yeah. And Chara came out.
*  The beloved Bruin, who is 6'9 defenseman, he was incredible.
*  But he was wearing the Porzingis jersey.
*  And he and he kept pulling it out and showing people.
*  And he looked like he could suit up and play for the Celtics.
*  Yeah. I mean, he's in great shape, runs
*  marathons.
*  It was interesting talking to I got there like three and a half hours early.
*  I was talking to trying to talk to a bunch of people, but especially
*  the Celtics heard everything during this break.
*  Like they knew they knew.
*  I'm glad to hear that.
*  I think Tatum, you know, because what happens is
*  when you forget this, it's not necessarily it's not like a Kevin Durant
*  situation where the guys online looking and, you know, I think KD would admit
*  he's online probably a little too much.
*  I don't know if the Celtics are online,
*  but their family members and their friends are.
*  And so they hear everything.
*  So when there's stuff like Kyrie and Luke are the two best guys in the series,
*  people are telling Jalen and Tatum that or they're saying Tatum,
*  you know, you're not a top five player.
*  So
*  I thought Jalen seemed like he translated it a little more personally tonight.
*  Tatum, I could see having a big game, too.
*  In game two, I read today something along that line in the paper that
*  Tatum tries to stay away from reading about all that.
*  But his mother doesn't know his mother and his mother was all over.
*  She's very upset.
*  She's mad. I actually met her tonight and and somebody said,
*  he's one of the national guys who's actually defending.
*  I was like, yeah, I'll take credit for that.
*  But she's a nice lady.
*  So you've had these tickets 51 years, your 10th finals.
*  The first year I've said this before, we got the tickets.
*  Seventy three, seventy four title title.
*  We made the finals and this is 50 years later.
*  And I did take you. I did carry you into one of those games.
*  I mean, you heard I believe you.
*  It was four, four and a half.
*  Yeah, I don't have a lot of memories of that one.
*  I remember the next season, the 76 season, but I don't remember 74.
*  Yeah. So we won a title first year, one ticket.
*  And then two years later, so your finals record is five and four.
*  Yeah, which I thought it was better.
*  For some reason, I felt like you were six and three or so.
*  But yeah, five and four is the record right now.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Lost in 22.
*  Ten, 87, 85.
*  Yeah.
*  Three to the Lakers, fucking assholes.
*  Well, that hook shot.
*  I still have nightmares about magic hook shot.
*  And how about oh, ten.
*  I made the mistake of flying you to L.A. for six and seven.
*  Well, suddenly our test makes a big shot at the end of the game.
*  I mean, really, Rashid Wallace, Huffin and Puffin.
*  Thirty five minutes at Rashid Wallace.
*  Tough one. But
*  having won a title in 16 years.
*  And this has been the best team in the league since the season started.
*  We have a lot on the line.
*  That's how I felt walking around the city all day to day and talking to people.
*  And it just feels like.
*  You could feel the pressure when they started chipping away in that.
*  You could feel the third quarter.
*  You could feel like, oh, you know, it might have been one of the best player of
*  crowds I can remember at starting the game.
*  But when they cut it to eight.
*  Everybody was nervous.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you could feel the tension in the crowd.
*  And I have to watch it.
*  I taped it.
*  I'd like I can't quite remember how we
*  went from eight all the way up to 20 so quickly, but we did.
*  I took notes during that.
*  It was seventy two sixty four for twenty seven left in the eighty sixty four.
*  Tatum three.
*  That's when they put Drew on Luca.
*  Five lively fouls.
*  And that's when I wrote my notes.
*  Drew is kind of the alpha because when it was seventy two sixty four and the crowd
*  was kind of zombies and that was we were watching the huddle and they would they.
*  And Missoula and those guys were on the court.
*  The coaches said to you, look at you.
*  You were like, Horford was really into it.
*  And Tatum was animated.
*  And they were all like, what are we doing?
*  Yeah.
*  And then Drew was just like, I'm guarding Luca now.
*  And that was it.
*  Yeah, it must have been.
*  Look at twenty seven. You finished with thirty.
*  Only three points after that.
*  It was fascinating to watch that huddle because just like you said.
*  The coaches weren't near the five players
*  and it looked like the five players made decisions on what was going to happen
*  next, including holiday was going to guard Luca.
*  Tatum was going to come out more aggressively.
*  I said to you because it I don't think it's happened all season.
*  Neither Tatum nor Brown came out in the third quarter.
*  Right. That never, ever happens.
*  Right. He always staggers them.
*  First row Joe.
*  Do a little tweak for you.
*  I'll give him that.
*  It's a pretty good one. I'll give him that.
*  Yeah, because in the regular season, he would have done the stubborn.
*  This is where I put my guys in and we don't deviate from what we do.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  And he did not do that.
*  Maybe the assistant coaches told him to do it.
*  Well, the thing we were talking about,
*  because Luca and Kyrie, they shot their wad with those guys to the whole third
*  quarter, especially they come out, they come in and look at the whole third
*  quarter, I think, I think he did. I want to say he did.
*  Irving came out of very cool.
*  But
*  I think when you have the game Tuesday, not till Sunday, you can get a little more
*  frisky with your big minutes guys, right?
*  We're playing for playing Saturday night.
*  It's a little different, a little different.
*  We took their big guys out of the game.
*  Gafford.
*  I remember having what seemed like, yeah,
*  what seemed like they wanted, they cared more about Lively Dallas and Lively got
*  like they put they put him when he had five fouls, they put him back.
*  There was a lot of time left.
*  They were like, we're shooting our wad with this one now.
*  But I thought Porzingis had his number, at least in game one.
*  What do you say about Lively?
*  Who, you know, I really think he's a gem, like that was turned out to be a great
*  pick, but he he was not afraid.
*  He was super physical.
*  I thought he was setting really hard, like borderline.
*  I think he kind of flagrant picks made about 12 fouls.
*  Yeah, he was really physical.
*  But you normally like these 20 year old
*  centers would come into a finals game like that with the way the crowd was.
*  I was even watching him during the the national anthem and he was like hopping
*  up and down and nodding like he did not seem scared at all.
*  A lot of confidence from the Minnesota series.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he's good.
*  I mean, even if even if he's just this for the next five years, like that's an asset.
*  But the one thing he neither he nor Gafford,
*  neither one can shoot away from the rim. Right.
*  I mean, that is hard in this era, the way
*  centers are shooting three point shots and with the kind of defense the Celtics have.
*  Yeah.
*  Watch and Luca.
*  And we've seen so many great players over the last 51 years.
*  I mean, first year season tickets beat Kareem
*  in the finals when he's at his apex.
*  We had 76.
*  That was McAdoo's last great year going
*  through Dr. J with those Philly teams.
*  Well, Kareem and Magic,
*  Tony, Andrew Tony, who absolutely killed us.
*  Going in with Dominic at his actual peak,
*  we saw Jordan as he was turning to Jordan and Isaiah.
*  Don't check might have 50 points Sunday night, but he did not control tonight's game.
*  But could absolutely have 50 points.
*  Yeah.
*  But what who does he remind you of?
*  Because to me, especially watch this.
*  That's I think the third Mavs game I've seen for playoffs in person.
*  There's a lot of Bird with him, a lot of Bird with him,
*  except Bird didn't control the ball like he does.
*  No. Well, he he never wanted to.
*  He always wanted the ball to move around.
*  And that's why they had nine assists,
*  because they did an awful lot of isolation, which was not to their benefit.
*  Luke is scary because he's a lot bigger than you think.
*  I don't think on TV you can appreciate how big he is.
*  You know, he looks like he's like a tight end, not even like a blocking tight end,
*  not even like a Travis Kelsey type tight end.
*  And the way he dribbles low to the ground, all of a sudden he's two feet from the basket.
*  Yeah.
*  He had a couple of really good defensive plays where he like stripped.
*  They're trying to, right, trying to hunt him and post them up.
*  And he foiled Porzingis.
*  We stripped him a couple of times.
*  We did.
*  So where does he rank for you? Who's number one for you?
*  Who's your number one scariest opponent in 51 years?
*  Oh, but you have to it has to be related to a specific series.
*  Andrew Tony.
*  Wow. I mean, people are a list of this going who?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he won that series for Philadelphia that year.
*  Because it was it was twos too.
*  Yeah. It was there.
*  It was just 18 footers and 14 footers and layups.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I might agree with you, actually.
*  I think he might have been because even Kobe, Kobe did fine against us.
*  But we I never felt like we couldn't stop them.
*  Well, Game 7 2010, that was not Kobe winning the game for them.
*  I guess 2012 LeBron when he and I won us.
*  That's LeBron's got to be in there.
*  LeBron.
*  I guess Tony LeBron, I guess for a career of watching playoff games against us,
*  it has to be LeBron.
*  I mean, you and I, what year was it?
*  2012 Game 6.
*  We're up three to two.
*  Well, also 2018 Game 7 when he basically beat us by himself.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought we missed like 43.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a great both of those series.
*  Yeah, he was awesome.
*  The one time we got his number was 2008 when he had the Manu Manu against Pierce.
*  I think my number one of overall the years was Kareem.
*  Kareem.
*  I just never felt like ever we could stop him as a little kid never felt that way.
*  Then I remember in 85.
*  It just felt like he just owned Parish.
*  Well, it's just what you said, the
*  Memorial Day Massacre that we killed L.A.
*  Who came back and killed us in Game 2?
*  Game 2 is Kareem.
*  Yeah. He brought his dad.
*  It was a famous story.
*  Brought his dad on the bus and they saw his dad on the bus.
*  They were like, oh, oh, the Lakers.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like his dad.
*  They just sat in the front next to each other and like magic.
*  And those guys like, oh, he was he killed us.
*  He killed us.
*  Yeah.
*  The Walton was
*  that was one of the fun things about that 86 season and why we were so sad we
*  didn't play them in the finals because Walton really went at him.
*  And they had that whole UCLA background.
*  He beat him in 77.
*  It would have been great.
*  And Walton played, if I recall, 80 of 82 regular season games.
*  And.
*  Do you remember I talked when I did the Walton Tribute, I talked about that
*  Portland game we went to when I was eight, when they beat us and felt like they beat
*  us by like 100 points and it was like the best team either.
*  Either one of us had ever seen.
*  I thought my memory of that game and I think we made a joke about it.
*  We were the Washington generals and they were all in globe practice.
*  That's how it felt that game.
*  It was so dispiriting.
*  And it was the first year we were really
*  sucking and it felt like that was the nail in the coffin.
*  Like, oh, it was Habit Checks last year.
*  It was like, oh, we're not only we're not going to win the title, we're not going to
*  make the playoffs, but I think we also as as basketball fans left that game saying,
*  boy, that team really play.
*  That's a special team.
*  That's a special team that a special team that plays.
*  Teamwork game that you never see anymore.
*  That was a great game.
*  Was he the best college player you saw or was it Maravich?
*  Probably Maravich, Alcindor and Walton.
*  It's tough to I mean, Maravich didn't win the titles.
*  Those two guys won.
*  Yeah, but you said Maravich was like appointment TV on the weekends.
*  Well, I mean, it was an era when there was no cable and there was one college game
*  on Saturday afternoon and every Saturday afternoon it was Maravich.
*  Right.
*  Because he was must see television.
*  It sounded fun.
*  It sounded like the men's equivalent of whatever happened with Caitlin Clark there
*  in the tournament, or is just he kind of had to see what was happening.
*  Yeah, the Walton thing.
*  I remember when they.
*  When we traded Maxwell for him and we were so disillusioned with Maxwell because he
*  really killed us in 85, because he he was hurt.
*  He didn't have like a torn ACL, but he was just not in shape the whole year.
*  And he really hurt them in the playoffs.
*  You know, he just never really.
*  Some guys just have trouble coming back from injuries and he just couldn't do it.
*  And flipping him into Walton, we were like, whoa.
*  Can because he played a he had a good season with the Clippers.
*  But then and I was living in Connecticut,
*  I was going to high school in Connecticut that year, but you were going to all those
*  games and you were just I was trying to watch as many as I could.
*  It wasn't the same.
*  We didn't have a league pass in 1986.
*  My was asking me about Walton when he played that year and.
*  What do I remember?
*  And it's funny, I certainly remember him playing.
*  But the thing I remember most were his four sons, his crazy kids right next to us.
*  And they were out of control.
*  Right.
*  The ushers could not control.
*  One of them became coach of the South of the Lakers.
*  Yeah, Luke Walton.
*  But those four kids were totally out of control.
*  I remember I had the Walton on the podcast and told him they sat on the other side
*  of the runway with us and we would just laugh because they were like the von
*  Eriks, they're like doing flying elbows on each other and jumping into other aisles.
*  And we could I remember Luke was at UCLA and I was like, Dad,
*  remember those kids, one of them's like an all American in college.
*  That's hard to believe.
*  Yeah.
*  But that was a really, really special year.
*  I was glad they honored him.
*  It's weird to think of somebody is like they called him one of the greatest
*  Celtics. I thought that was neat.
*  And I think that's it's fair.
*  It was one of the greatest Celtics careers, but he's certainly one of the
*  best ten guys who ever played for the Celtics.
*  And I think his experience here was the
*  coup de grace of his career. Yeah.
*  It meant so much to him.
*  I told you this, that when he would call
*  the Celtics, like asking for them coming into town, can I get tickets or whatever?
*  And whoever answered, he's like Bill Walton, class of 1986.
*  That's how he would identify himself on the phone.
*  But it was cool.
*  I was I kind of felt like they were going to win tonight with all the Walton stuff.
*  It was like, all right, though, this is good karma.
*  Well, I'll tell you about something this week.
*  I reread the epilogue, the
*  epilogue of your book,
*  my basketball about Bill Walton, and it was very meaningful.
*  Very sad to see that he passed.
*  Yeah. Well, I was thinking about I got to read Briggs to the game again now, but,
*  you know, he's such a big part of that book.
*  And I don't know how many times I read that book, but he
*  the what if potential of him was one of the things that I grew up with.
*  And it was, you know, out of all the great players ever, it's like him.
*  Lembias. There's only a couple where you're like, man, he got his two championships.
*  Yeah. Samson's a little like that, too.
*  I really felt like Samson was.
*  Was not not on the Walton, like all time
*  level. But you think of like, like Derek Rose is like that.
*  These guys, Grant Hill is a good one.
*  Yeah. Grant Hill was incredible.
*  There's a lot of guys like that.
*  But he was out of all the what if guys, he was the most talented, I think.
*  All right. What's your prediction for game two?
*  My prediction for game two is that Tatum has a really big game and.
*  Oh, like a pounding in the basket controlling.
*  Yeah. And that.
*  He goes, he looks at the tape of game one
*  and says, I could have had seven layups, right?
*  What was I doing?
*  I hope that's what he does.
*  That's what I would do if I was looking at the tape.
*  Scale of one to ten.
*  How horrified are you going to be to see Scott Foster?
*  Who's your least favorite?
*  Oh, Mark Davis is your least favorite.
*  My least favorite.
*  So we'll probably see him.
*  Although, again,
*  I think it's OK to criticize referees when you won the game.
*  I just thought we got.
*  I thought.
*  Dallas could have been called for twice as many fouls as they did.
*  We won by 18.
*  I know.
*  See people listening.
*  This is where I get it from.
*  Make excuses for the other team.
*  Yeah, now it's probably a Mark Davis Sunday game, too.
*  I think it's probably Scott Foster.
*  They always seem to throw him in when the other.
*  You don't think he gets four and seven.
*  There's 12 refs.
*  So, OK, so somebody is going to get two games.
*  I think a few people get two games.
*  You see, they they may be worried that there isn't a game seven.
*  And Scott Foster is one of their more veteran refs.
*  I don't know.
*  Well, game two Sunday, three days away in the Minnesota game, too.
*  They did they did try to activate the Foster extension and it didn't really.
*  It didn't work.
*  You were the most afraid of.
*  I'm not I swear I'm not jinxing anything here.
*  You were the most afraid of Denver.
*  I was in the West.
*  Jokic terrifies you because you went to that Denver game.
*  I thought Denver, you know, we're just talking about that Portland 70 17.
*  I thought Denver played a little bit like that.
*  The way they move the ball around.
*  I'm I'm still shocked that they lost to that Minnesota team.
*  I don't I still don't understand it.
*  Yeah, because then you watch Minnesota just lay an egg in the next round,
*  not just like that, they didn't play well, but some of their strategy stuff was bad.
*  I don't know how they beat Denver.
*  Coaching was bad.
*  Yeah. How did they do it?
*  No teamwork, a lot of isolation with Edwards.
*  I don't know how they did it.
*  And how did he play as well as he was playing for some of that series?
*  Because then he crashed our idea in the headlight in the Dallas series.
*  And how do you beat Denver when you have
*  the knucklehead factor of some of the guys on that team, too?
*  You know, like Towns was so bad in round three.
*  Right now, I.
*  All season long, you and I said, God, I hope it's not Denver.
*  Well, it ended up not being Denver.
*  I never thought it'd be Dallas.
*  I thought it'd be Oklahoma City.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's when it's now past midnight.
*  I got to get you home.
*  What's your prediction for game two?
*  I'm terrified of Luca.
*  I do think.
*  I think they have at least solved.
*  Kyrie's not going to go off.
*  They're too disciplined with how they're defending them.
*  They have too many good guys and they have room protection.
*  But the Luca.
*  He's just impossible.
*  I thought he wore down as the game went along.
*  And maybe it was part of it, like some of the stuff they were doing,
*  trying to force him to play defense in certain ways.
*  I said that to you. I thought.
*  Yeah, I thought Dallas looked tired in the fourth quarter.
*  So maybe Dallas will try to figure out some stuff with that.
*  I'm trying to think.
*  It's always about there was a game, too.
*  It's about the adjustments.
*  I'm trying to think what their adjustments would be other than
*  they're going to have to figure out a different poor Zingas plan.
*  Right.
*  And then they had a plan and they're going to have to figure out how to have
*  better ball movement because you're just never winning a game with nine assists.
*  If I'm Jason Kidd, it was one of the best point cards ever.
*  And I'm talking to my team after that game or in preparation for Sunday.
*  Yeah, saying we had nine assists guys.
*  Right.
*  What the hell? That's that's not team basketball.
*  Well, I wonder if they'll try to move
*  Luca a little further down to to try to get him kind of like what we were saying.
*  They should.
*  We never understand why the Celtics don't do more.
*  Tate him is post him up on the foul line.
*  He's so good on the foul line.
*  Because he can spin and go to the basket or do little fallbacks.
*  And when he's 25, three from the basket, I just don't like it as much.
*  But I think with Luca, it's a mix of that,
*  like just trying to get in the ball in different spots.
*  And then they got to figure out the corner threes.
*  How did we take those away? How do you get him back?
*  Right.
*  How late are you going to be up tonight?
*  I feel like you're going to rewatch the game.
*  It could be a three o'clock night for you.
*  I'll watch it tomorrow morning.
*  I'm I'm bedtime.
*  All right. 10 finals for my dad.
*  We got to win. This is fun.
*  We're going Sunday night.
*  I guess I'm I'm Rossello's taking my place.
*  I guess I was taking your place.
*  I think you're we're activating you for game five.
*  OK, so Monday, game five.
