# Team USA On Fire, 2024 vs 1992, and Tatum’s Struggles With Rob Mahoney | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50)
*  All right, we're taping this. It is 2 20 Pacific time, Tuesday afternoon. Somehow I have been up for 10 hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=0.0s)]
*  I got up super early today [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  to watch on replay second half of the grease game and then powered all the way through [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=9.52s)]
*  four days. Rob Mahoney is here from the ringer. Rob, I wrote about this in 2012 when I went to the Olympics and had no real idea [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=14.8s)]
*  what a great sporting event this is. Four games in a row with a lot of the best players in the world just all [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=22.0s)]
*  coming up on it's basically like Lollapalooza for basketball. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  We had every really truly great player playing today except for Luca and Jalen Brunson if you want to call Brunson a great player, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=32.72s)]
*  but it was one incredible game, two dramatic games and then a USA blowout. But for the most part, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=39.599999999999994s)]
*  there's just nothing like this. I think I like this more than any [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=45.76s)]
*  single NBA playoff game day. Well, especially for a single site and in theory a single neutral site, although [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=50.32s)]
*  you know with the French team cooking the way they are, games being in Paris that changes things a little bit, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=56.96s)]
*  but the fact that you can get into that building and stay all day through all of these games, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=61.44s)]
*  that's an incredible turn and it's an incredible thing even for basketball sickos like us [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=65.84s)]
*  on the other side of the world cranking it at 2 a.m. to check in on these games. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=70.48s)]
*  It gets a little wild, but I kind of like the sicko mode of the Olympics to be honest with you. What time did you get up? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=75.44s)]
*  I went with the 530 start. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=81.92s)]
*  I went with the 530 start, caught up along the way. Also, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=84.64s)]
*  I just kind of figured Germany was going to handle Greece and I didn't need to be completely plugged in for that right out of the gate. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=87.52s)]
*  Turned out to be the the correct call. I did the hardcore wake up like I was getting up for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=94.4s)]
*  an early flight or something. Didn't look at my phone, went right downstairs, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=99.44s)]
*  rewound whatever the live feed was on Peacock or as I like to call it in my house during the Olympics, the cock. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=104.3s)]
*  Re-round the cock an hour, got the second half, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=110.56s)]
*  and it was 36 36 and I was like, whoa! [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=114.16s)]
*  And I had seen on my phone I had a bunch of texts. So I was like, did Yannis do it? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=118.16s)]
*  Did he beat Greece by himself? That's one of the fun things about, especially when you get to this knockout stage, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=122.32s)]
*  it's basically we're gonna take one of the greatest people in the world at doing something [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=128.32s)]
*  and we're just gonna put him with a bunch of mediocre people and see if we could figure it out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=133.36s)]
*  Mediocre might be strong with some of these supporting cast. By international basketball, Olympic standards. Absolutely. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=137.2s)]
*  It's like you're taking like the you know, the greatest guitarist in the world and you're like here [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=143.27999999999997s)]
*  will you play with this band, this college band that's been together for two years? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=147.92s)]
*  Can you try to figure out how to be great with this? But it was so much fun to watch. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=151.27999999999997s)]
*  Germany, Greece was really good. What what order do you want to go in? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=155.2s)]
*  Do you just want to go chronological or do you or do you want to build up to what was ultimately the main event? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=159.04s)]
*  Obviously being France's incredible win over Canada. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=163.84s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. Well, why don't we do [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=168.08s)]
*  we'll start with US. Okay. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=170.96s)]
*  And then we'll hit the other two and then we'll go to France. Yeah, but I haven't uncorked some of my Team USA vlogs. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=174.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know you've been you've been getting shots off. I've just been like in the practice gym. Nobody's seen me. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=180.56s)]
*  Yeah, you've never said anything about Jason Tatum Olympic athlete before. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=186.4s)]
*  I've said a lot of stuff on on multiple text threads. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=190.56s)]
*  There was some panicky stuff. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=194.56s)]
*  I i'll start here. This olympics was clearly built around [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=196.72s)]
*  Lebron and Durant [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=201.26s)]
*  and curry, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  They I don't think I fully realized that until we were in like the uh, the warm-up game [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=205.2s)]
*  So it's like oh, this is what we're doing this year. Everybody else is a supporting cast. This is about these three guys [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=209.76s)]
*  That was fine with it. They're three of the best parts of all time. I think this olympics has been good for lebron [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  I think it's been good for Kevin Durant and it's been bad for Steph Curry [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Every game there hasn't been one even fun Steph Curry. There has been like an 11 points in two minutes and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  We hit the point today where I was like, oh man, is this going to be Steph's whole olympics? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=231.92s)]
*  He's just gonna suck because I don't think Steph sucks [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=235.92s)]
*  Well, clearly, you know, he's he's still one of the best [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=239.04s)]
*  15 guys in the league just for whatever reason he's not playing well. So what's wrong what's happening? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean he still makes team USA better with his movement like he does [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=247.6s)]
*  He provides something to this group that basically no one else does maybe short of Devin Booker [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=250.88s)]
*  I would say is the only close analog in terms of a movement shooter, which is something that they need for their spacing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=255.36s)]
*  If you took him off the floor took him out of the mix entirely they would miss that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=260.8s)]
*  He just isn't hitting in the way that we're accustomed to him hitting [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=265.04s)]
*  And some of that is he does stand out, you know out on the perimeter [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=268.56s)]
*  Off ball a lot more than even these other guys even the wings who are having a hard time your Jason Tatum types, for example [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=272.56s)]
*  Honestly get more on ball reps and touches than Steph does in these games [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=278.88s)]
*  And so he is he's playing a very particular role and I wouldn't say doing great with it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=283.12s)]
*  But he's playing a part on a stack team and ultimately that's what all these guys are doing to varying effects [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  And a lot of them are are struggling in some way or another [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=293.6s)]
*  You know, Joel is feeling his way through this clearly Jason Tatum is feeling his way through this clear [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=296.32s)]
*  Clearly the second unit I think has acclimated itself very well that Derek White, Duran, Ant, Bam and AD those guys haven't figured out [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  Everyone else is trying to like find how they fit into this thing and I would say no one more than Steph [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=309.36s)]
*  well, it's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=315.68s)]
*  It's so interesting that Curry's the coach because he's been [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=316.8s)]
*  Curry's coach really since the 14-15 season [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=319.84s)]
*  And I really appreciate and admire what they've tried to do the coaching staff. They're basically like the ball's gonna move [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=323.28s)]
*  If we don't want people we don't want ball dominance [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=329.12s)]
*  We don't want a lot of dribbling if you're not going to cut and move and shoot when you're open [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=332.96s)]
*  You might not play as much and that's we'll talk about Tatum in a second [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=337.52s)]
*  But I think the biggest problem with Tatum is he's not shooting [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=340.64s)]
*  He's passing up open threes wide open shots and supposedly that's happening in practice too [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=345.12s)]
*  And for I don't know what happened to him. He you go back. I guess we're going to talk about him now [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=350.56s)]
*  Um [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  You go back to the Miami Eastern Conference finals [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=356.32s)]
*  It's 26 playoff games all the way through the 2024 playoffs. He's seven three is a game [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=359.28s)]
*  He should 27 from three. That's that's westbrook land [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you're under 30 you're in westbrook land and that's a pretty huge sample size and we talked about a lot on all of our [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=367.68s)]
*  Podcasts during the playoffs for whatever reason is three point shot [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=373.2s)]
*  Slid a little sideways and then down and now it's to the point where he's passing them up [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=377.76s)]
*  And [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=382.64s)]
*  That's why he's not playing this isn't like steve kerr has has an axe to grind against tatum [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=383.52s)]
*  It's like oh my god. We have so many great guys [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=388.8s)]
*  Tatum has been first team omba three years in a row. He should be playing he's the perfect [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=391.28s)]
*  Four for olympic basketball because he can rebound he can play defense. He can switch positions [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  But if he can't shoot kerr's not going to play him and I feel like when we get to the medal round [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=403.84s)]
*  I don't think he's going to play I think he's going to be out of the rotation [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=407.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he's not even in that second five right now [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=410.56s)]
*  He's he's coming in the auxiliary minutes and I think that's kind of the right deployment of his skill set [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=412.88s)]
*  With with adjustment for matchup, right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=418.88s)]
*  There are going to be games where team os a wants to play smaller and you even saw traces of that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=420.56s)]
*  This was never going to be a competitive game brazil basically [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  Like tricked their way into the out rounds based on the fact that they had a weak group and specifically on the fact that they [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=429.76s)]
*  Got to play japan and beat up on them [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  That's really the only reason they were here and then the usa drew the softest first round opponent [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=436.88s)]
*  And I think probably the softest second round opponent that we can talk about that a little bit, too [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=441.76s)]
*  This was never going to be a game that said there were moments where [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  Marcelo Huerta's was kind of embarrassing joelle imbede on pull-up jumpers [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=450.4s)]
*  Yeah, and we've seen that with south sudan. We've seen that anytime that imbede is in a pure drop [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=454.4s)]
*  It's a very vulnerable position. I thought he adjusted well enough to actually start contesting some shots [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=459.52s)]
*  Being more of a factor on ball on defense in a way that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  I hate to say it is almost surprising to see at some points just because he can be more of a passive drop defender [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=468.24s)]
*  Where he's sort of waiting for the game to come to him and yeah [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=473.6s)]
*  I understand the virtue of that as far as a deterrent, but you need someone who is impacting the game on the ball [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=476.24s)]
*  And if he's not they're gonna play smaller and guys like tatum are gonna be more important and certainly guys like bam and ad [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=483.04s)]
*  Are gonna be more important [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=487.68s)]
*  All of which is to say there's gonna be opportunity for jason tatum at some point even if he's playing poorly [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  It just worries me that his offense is in this kind of state where he's so clearly in his own head about it [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's passing up the open shots in a way that we sometimes see stars do as they kind of graduate into their career [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=500.24s)]
*  They get less and less comfortable taking pure catch and shoot opportunities. He's not the only star to suffer from that problem [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=506.56s)]
*  I mean look no further than nicola yokich who all of a sudden can't really shoot threes either like it happens [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=513.2s)]
*  Weirdly to some very talented players [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=518.0s)]
*  But he's still taking him is the difference. He's still taking him and he's not like, oh my god [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=520.72s)]
*  I might not make this i'm just gonna put my head down and drive to the basket because I don't want to take this [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=524.48s)]
*  Which tatum did multiple times today and when tatum does go into his bag into his move set [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=529.04s)]
*  He just ends up smoking some layups missing some shots like against smaller defenders that he otherwise would make he's he's in a really weird [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=534.72s)]
*  Place offensively right now that it doesn't concern me long term [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=541.52s)]
*  But I have no idea what to make of him as a member of this team [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=544.8s)]
*  Well, he certainly had the biggest workload of anybody played over 100 games big minutes [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=547.84s)]
*  That's the only excuse you can make [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  But it's it's I gotta say a little dark on the celtic fan threads i'm on like to the point that I was looking at [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=555.5200000000001s)]
*  2018 youtube clips of him. Oh no and his jump shot. Oh no [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=562.7s)]
*  And i'm just like what's different because it doesn't feel the same because even when he was a rookie and we couldn't get him [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=567.2s)]
*  To shoot and that was a big narrative like jason just we don't have a lot of offense on this team [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  Just shoot take over like go for it, man [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=577.2s)]
*  Um, he would without hesitation just a beautiful jump shot [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=580.4s)]
*  And the only thing that i've noticed and I don't know if this is a working theory, but I would love to see some maniac on [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=584.4s)]
*  YouTube try to do the before-after [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=591.28s)]
*  It seems like he's afraid to land forward if you go back and watch his old jump shots [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=593.92s)]
*  He's his feet kick forward right almost like where you could land and like sprain your ankle like in the landing spot [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=599.28s)]
*  He did this kick out and it feels like over the years they've tried to get him not to do that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=605.6s)]
*  So he doesn't get hurt [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=610.08s)]
*  He took a shot. Um, I think it was the last game or the or the second or last game in the corner [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=611.52s)]
*  Where it was almost like a set shot and I was like, what the fuck was that? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=618.24s)]
*  That's not how you shoot. So these are the text threads i'm on where we're just like landing zone mechanics [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=622.48s)]
*  Yeah, we're landing zone mechanics [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=627.6s)]
*  Um the celtics are for sale [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what is jalen brown's new girlfriend is this going to be good for him him going him saying the thing about how he didn't make [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=631.92s)]
*  The team saw sounds very healthy. How long is porzingis out? It's like we just won the title. I should be enjoying this [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=637.76s)]
*  At least you have derrick white, you know, well that's not all bad [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  So I have on one south expand thread i'm on one of the guys is a glass half full guy and he's like guys derrick white's been [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=647.5999999999999s)]
*  Amazing. I can't keep him off the floor. Look, let's talk about that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=653.92s)]
*  I'm like, all right [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=657.28s)]
*  But you mentioned earlier like the lineups that have worked and haven't worked [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=658.32s)]
*  And I felt this way after the second game where I was just like it's just clear [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=662.24s)]
*  What's going to be the lineup if it's really ball busting time? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=666.96s)]
*  Whether lebron's there's two two lineups one that has lebron one. That's just the pure second unit, which is uh, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=670.88s)]
*  Well lebron is going to be on the floor. Well, I know in ball busting time [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=677.36s)]
*  So but there's that lineup of drew white kd ant in either bam or ad where they're just like here's defense and kd [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=680.88s)]
*  Is just going to make every shot and these two guards [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=687.76s)]
*  Have the ball for a split second and you watch that lineup. You're like, holy shit [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=690.96s)]
*  What's interesting is curry's not on that lineup either. There's lebron [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=694.88s)]
*  Then there's the other lineup with drew and white and booker and lebron and ad [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=698.24s)]
*  Where you watch that one? You're like man, this is [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=703.6s)]
*  Basically three guards with lebron and ad and lebron and ad the chemistry they have and I think those have been my two favorite lineups [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  There's there's a white booker kd lebron ad [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=713.52s)]
*  Five some that I feel could be the crunch time lineup like either white or drew in that spot [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=717.44s)]
*  Yeah, but it's weird that curry's not in any of those lineups and that's been a shock for me because well, let's say it's 82 to 80 [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=722.48s)]
*  in the against serbia [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=730.88s)]
*  And curry's like I just got to play my best five guys [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=733.12s)]
*  Would he be willing to sick curry in the last four minutes if he's not doing well? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=735.92s)]
*  So the situation in which I think that might have been a conversation [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=740.16s)]
*  Was if canada was on board right especially if you have a lead guard who stef would have to defend [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=743.84s)]
*  And put him in a vulnerable position like we've seen that he's just not up for those sorts of assignments right now [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=750.64s)]
*  And yeah, you can cross match and get drew or derrick white or whoever else you want in there [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=755.12s)]
*  But if there were ever a matchup [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=759.2s)]
*  Where stef was a defensive liability and it was a close game [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=761.2s)]
*  Then you might see him take it off the floor, but i'm looking at the remaining field and especially the guards [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=764.32s)]
*  I'm, not really seeing an opponent that stef couldn't handle and that makes me think right because of the politics because of the leadership [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  When it comes down to it [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=777.6s)]
*  I would say especially stef and lebron will be on the floor whether that's the best lineup or not [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=779.2s)]
*  Kevin durant will sometimes but we've also seen that maybe in some cases he won't [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=783.76s)]
*  But I think stef and lebron are the true non-negotiables of this team when when the games and the minutes actually matter [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  Seems like it because I would have said tatum was a non-negotiable for the top 10 and now I feel like he's not in the top [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=794.96s)]
*  10 you would have said indeed is like definitely gonna start then he sat the second game [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=800.64s)]
*  He looked better today and I know we're gonna talk about him in a second, but um [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  I feel the best when drew and white are out there together because I think neither of them need the ball [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=809.9200000000001s)]
*  They do all the little blue guys stuff together [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=816.0s)]
*  You know, and then it just opens up everything else and they just feel the most like a basketball team [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=819.04s)]
*  But regardless they have so many options. I mean this is [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=823.52s)]
*  I'm not i'm not ever gonna say this is the best olympic team. USA we've ever had but [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=827.68s)]
*  I think this is the best team we've had since 92. I don't even think it's a question. This team has size and shooting [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=833.12s)]
*  And athleticism and youth and experience and all kinds of lineups they can play [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  You go backwards every four years [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=845.52s)]
*  There's no team that has as many options and as much star power [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=847.28s)]
*  As this team and you think like curry's not even playing that well and bids been out of shape [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=851.2s)]
*  Tatum has been playing bad and I still feel like it's the best in the last 32 years [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=855.0400000000001s)]
*  Would you put anybody in the last 32 years since 92? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=859.2s)]
*  Against them. Yeah, you think this group is definitively better than oh eight [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I think they had more they have more size [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=867.84s)]
*  Like the size thing was always an issue when they would go against the gassals and oh eight in [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=871.2s)]
*  2012 because they were always felt like they were one big guy short [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=876.3000000000001s)]
*  And they would kind of run out of options that the in the last five minutes [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=879.84s)]
*  It was like we're just gonna have to play this five. This is what we have, you know [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  And you would always see bosh or 2012 kevin love. Yeah was out there this time. It's it's like oh, we're playing france [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=886.32s)]
*  Cool, we have three centers. We're fine. Yes, you know, even if you go back to 2000, I think alonzo was the only actual center on the team [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=893.44s)]
*  so [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  This year it's like I I don't know what this team doesn't have do you like what would you add? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=902.24s)]
*  They have everything you'd want I think that's the thing in terms of the flexibility and I would also say relative to the level of competition [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=907.1999999999999s)]
*  In oh eight that spain team was really good [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=913.84s)]
*  But otherwise the level of international competition is not where it is right now [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=916.96s)]
*  So the baseline for all competitive teams is higher even though there isn't a one singular standout like that gassals combination [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=920.4s)]
*  Other than maybe germany. I think germany is probably the only club that has a has a case for that right that has a case for the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=928.56s)]
*  The cohesion and the style and the balance and they don't have team usa depth but relative to these other international teams [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=934.8s)]
*  They have pretty incredible depth [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=940.72s)]
*  They're going to be a tough opponent if team usa gets a chance to play against them [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=942.88s)]
*  And I really hope that they do but otherwise you're right the flexibility of this group is pretty incredible [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=946.4s)]
*  And if they ever wanted to pair down a seven or eight man rotation or go to those [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=952.0s)]
*  Key actual best players and best lineups when it mattered. There's just nobody who can keep up with that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=957.1999999999999s)]
*  so the lebron thing's been interesting because [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=962.8s)]
*  They clearly were putting the car keys with him in the warm-up games and then at the first two games [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=966.4s)]
*  He was putting up stats, but I [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=971.44s)]
*  I didn't feel like he was playing that well [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  I thought he was kind of ball dominant he had 12 turnovers in the first two games and it just felt like [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=974.96s)]
*  I felt like him and stef specifically [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=980.32s)]
*  Some of what was going on was like this is a this is a big olympics for me [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=984.0s)]
*  I have to I have to show off like I have to I have to prove to everybody like you know [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=988.24s)]
*  And then I felt like that went away in the third game. I thought in the whole third game in the first half of today [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=994.96s)]
*  Like watching the shit he was doing it was so high level. He's just like i'm just going to make everybody better [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1002.72s)]
*  I'm just going to be completely additive. I'm just going to try to set dudes up keep the ball moving [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1007.6s)]
*  And the ball dominant stuff went away then ironically it came back in the second half [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1012.72s)]
*  Uh the game was already over. Yeah, but watching him be the facilitator like that, which I think is what they want from him [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1017.1199999999999s)]
*  Um, and then you see all the toys and it was like this [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1023.92s)]
*  We always thought we've been following lebron for so long [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1027.44s)]
*  It's like 20 years with this guy and there was always like well he could [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1029.9199999999998s)]
*  There was this jordan side where if he had to score he could and he would also have this magic side and he would hybrid it together [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1033.28s)]
*  But the the fun part for me on for him on this team is that he can just kind of be magic johnson [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1039.52s)]
*  And I felt like he really leaned into it the last couple days and there's no other player in the world [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1046.24s)]
*  I don't think at his size that can do that and it was just fun to watch so I was like, oh yeah [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1051.52s)]
*  I almost forget that he has this [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1055.84s)]
*  Does that sound crazy to say no? No, I mean I think he's been that guy [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1058.08s)]
*  I mean in some ways he's still that guy for the lakers at times [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1062.72s)]
*  It's just they don't have the supporting talent. He just has the ball all the time [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1065.2s)]
*  He has the ball a lot and more in those cases than he probably should here [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1068.32s)]
*  I do think he is doing some of that toggling where if you want to extend an 08 comparison [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1071.84s)]
*  He's somewhere between the kobe of that team and the jason kid of that team, right? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1077.76s)]
*  Depending on what the moment requires honestly [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1082.32s)]
*  We really haven't seen many moments where he has to be the kobe more that [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1084.48s)]
*  I think sometimes he gets bored and decides he wants to be the kobe and that's fine too given this level of competition [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1087.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's something that is incredible [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1093.28s)]
*  No other player on this team can do not many players in the world can do to be totally honest with you [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1095.84s)]
*  And so yeah the passing that he presents this group [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  Is pretty unique if you were to just run your playmaking through, you know [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1104.08s)]
*  Derek white and stef and devin booker and the other kind of like [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1107.9199999999998s)]
*  Go-to ball handlers on their respective teams [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1112.3999999999999s)]
*  The flow would look entirely different and I think in particular the bigs would be much less involved like having lebron is what makes [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1115.36s)]
*  Some of these bigs as impactful as they are and it's what makes joel's minutes so frustrating because he should be able [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1121.84s)]
*  To catch and finish relatively easily [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1127.52s)]
*  Sometimes he chooses not to and to his credit [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1130.0s)]
*  He did step out and his threes were finally hitting could not shoot for the life of him in group play [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1133.04s)]
*  Three of three from deep in this game, which is that's huge if he can do that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1138.16s)]
*  All of a sudden the minutes are going to be a big net positive for for joel [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1142.72s)]
*  Well, he he already looks like he's in slightly better shape than he was two weeks ago [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1146.24s)]
*  Uh, he's moving better. I still think he's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1150.8799999999999s)]
*  Really looks plotting like he does he just doesn't look in shape and I know a bunch of people have made that point [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1153.68s)]
*  But the ball stopping part [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1158.8s)]
*  I just think [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1161.2s)]
*  I think kerr and the staff made a decision like we just it's not gonna fly even with the ant you can kind of see [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1162.56s)]
*  He's doing it but he's also so talented and so explosive and especially against countries that aren't as good as america [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1170.0s)]
*  It's almost like you kind of have to have them out there anyway [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1177.2s)]
*  Yeah, but he wants to drive too like kevin durant is an incredible shooter incredible score [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1179.6s)]
*  Is not going to get to the basket a lot to be honest with you and so having someone like ant even if he does [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1184.56s)]
*  Dribble a little more than everyone else. That's a valuable thing [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1189.04s)]
*  It does make you think as you watch because it's this different style of basketball [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1192.4s)]
*  In some ways and then it's completely the same as the nba in other ways [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1196.64s)]
*  But you watch like the stuff that works. It's a more frenetic pace, which I was talking to saruti about this yesterday with franz [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1199.68s)]
*  It's a better [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1206.08s)]
*  just a better [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1207.28s)]
*  Sport for franz the sleeper version where it's like chaotic. There's not a lot of timeouts the ball moves people are just flying in the basket [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1208.64s)]
*  and it's like that's in his wheelhouse and the way the nba is set up it's so much like [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  You know think about tatum how much tatum and brown just like walk it up [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1222.16s)]
*  Try to figure out what happens like one guy having the ball for 10 12 seconds [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1225.76s)]
*  And that's what works more in the nba or or yokich on denver where they would run that play. It's like dump it on the side [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1229.44s)]
*  He's going to back his guy down for seven eight seconds in phoebe. You just can't do it [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1236.88s)]
*  I think they did that maybe twice with him today and the ball really has to zip around and guys have to cut and there's [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1241.52s)]
*  This just extra intelligence [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1247.04s)]
*  That needs to be there in this comfort with playing that way and some guys just don't [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1249.52s)]
*  Innately have it. Yeah, you know, don't you notice that as you're watching it? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1254.16s)]
*  Of course, and I think it usually affects the americans more than most right? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1257.6s)]
*  Especially some of these other international teams that have more continuity and familiarity within the groups [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1260.88s)]
*  They usually do fine [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1266.56s)]
*  The americans are always a different combination. It's always a bit of a scramble. Yeah, there are some through lines [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1268.32s)]
*  There's some stars who are going to come back [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1273.2s)]
*  But there's some guys who are going to have to figure it out [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1274.64s)]
*  And these are guys who are used to being in that primary creator role who are used to having the ball on their hands [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1276.72s)]
*  The adjustment for that is always going to be pretty profound and it's why you see [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1281.92s)]
*  From the exhibition games to the group play to I would say in particular [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1286.0s)]
*  Probably the next round right like when when usa and serbia face off you'll start to see [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1290.88s)]
*  We I would say we've already seen it with devin booker in particular [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1295.6799999999998s)]
*  He's moving so much better than he was at the start of this is my favorite [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1298.2399999999998s)]
*  My favorite version of him in a couple years. It's awesome and he's had good stats and he's made all mba teams [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1302.08s)]
*  But i'm like, wow, I didn't know he could do this. He can be a buzzsaw whenever he wants to be [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1307.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and yeah [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1311.76s)]
*  He has the other stuff too the mid post game the footwork like he can get to all that for the suns and whenever [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1312.3999999999999s)]
*  team usa would want him to but if you can just have him harness and attacking in transition and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1317.6s)]
*  You're spotting up for wide open threes [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1323.44s)]
*  Why wouldn't you do that with a hyper talented player like that? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1325.76s)]
*  Right like why wouldn't you hone his skill set to the absolute best things that he can do [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1328.64s)]
*  In the same way that lebron is honing his game to the absolute best things that he can do [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1333.04s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting this sounds corny, but [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1337.2s)]
*  You watch some of these guys and like booker didn't really seem that happy the last two years [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1340.16s)]
*  And he seems happy on this team like kd who I don't [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1345.04s)]
*  I wouldn't say kd's had the last the most joyous last five years [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1348.56s)]
*  And katie's just smiling like a he's just lighting up all over the place these guys [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1352.72s)]
*  They're just kind of in the zone and some of these dudes just love being on this team playing the style that they're playing and [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1358.0s)]
*  You see you got like bam [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1364.16s)]
*  Who you know? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1366.16s)]
*  That wind horse thing was funny when win horse which he was right [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1367.84s)]
*  He was like one of the three centers is probably not going to play today [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1370.56s)]
*  Yeah, might be bam and then bam played and he was [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1373.52s)]
*  really good, but [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1377.04s)]
*  um [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1378.24s)]
*  It did make sense. It was like imbede ad or bam who's gonna sit well probably bam [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1379.4399999999998s)]
*  But then you watch this team and it's like they can't take bam out bam does too many good things [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1383.6799999999998s)]
*  Why would you yeah, why would you so? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1387.76s)]
*  I think [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1390.56s)]
*  from an imbede standpoint [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1392.0s)]
*  um [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1394.56s)]
*  It looked super grim [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1395.84s)]
*  Today 14.7 rebounds in the first half moving better blocked the shot [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1399.04s)]
*  I went from thinking he wasn't going to play in the medal round that they were going to come up with some [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1404.9599999999998s)]
*  Reason to kind of bump them to now wondering what they're going to do [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1409.36s)]
*  And I think they at least start them [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1413.28s)]
*  And maybe in the second half, maybe he doesn't play in the fourth quarter [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1415.28s)]
*  But yeah, I don't I don't see him getting another dmp [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1418.8799999999999s)]
*  Which makes me think it's probably tatum and probably using him like they did where he comes in in the second quarter [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1422.9599999999998s)]
*  For somebody for like four minutes to save some face, but that's about it [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1429.12s)]
*  That would be my guess that would make sense [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1433.12s)]
*  And look we're already seeing in this game imbede did not start the second half and didn't play the second half [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1435.52s)]
*  Wouldn't surprise me whether you plug ad or bam into that spot for this game [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  It was bam, but really either option is great. And when those are the alternatives [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1444.6399999999999s)]
*  If imbede doesn't have it or isn't giving you quite what you want or isn't fitting the flow of whatever the play needs to be [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1449.2s)]
*  for that particular game [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1455.28s)]
*  I I think you ever have every right to do that and he's clearly when he is not on [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1457.12s)]
*  Is the single most disruptive piece of team usa but he said the word he had said what 80% of the worst turnovers we've seen from [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1462.24s)]
*  tbs and there's some bad just whipping the ball and gets guys in the first row the only reason these games were ever close so [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1468.72s)]
*  Far is when team usa is turning the ball over a lot and whatever the other team is is running out the other way [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1475.52s)]
*  And getting easy buckets if they don't do that, they're gonna walk over pretty much everybody [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1480.8799999999999s)]
*  but I agree with you that all of these guys who [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1484.8799999999999s)]
*  you know may be varying levels of [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1488.72s)]
*  Either competitive or kind of grumbly for their actual nba teams depending on what their circumstances are like i'm sure stef [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  Is at least somewhat displeased with what has happened to the warriors over time since they since they won the title, right? Like [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1498.24s)]
*  For him, even if he's playing poorly [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1504.48s)]
*  He gets to play on a team like this and you're right about devin booker and kevin duran and these these teams that had like [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1506.3200000000002s)]
*  Underwhelming playoff performances and I don't know if you saw that kevin durant quote a couple weeks ago [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1511.2800000000002s)]
*  Someone asked him. I think about i mean k adams [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1515.7600000000002s)]
*  If if ask kd if he was still happy to be in phoenix and his response was i'm happy to be alive [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1518.0s)]
*  Wow, you know that's that's kind of a non denial denial [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1525.36s)]
*  Yeah denial denial. He's happy to be alive and it seems like he's happy to be a part of this team [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1529.04s)]
*  And I think this can be a really rich and rewarding experience even for the guys who are trying to figure it out like joelle [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1534.0s)]
*  If nothing else seems to relish being able to quiet all these boos that he's getting all the time every time [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1540.4s)]
*  He's hitting a shot every time he's making a play. It still seems like he's having fun. Even if he's not playing well [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1545.52s)]
*  Yeah, I was trying to think if you're in halliburton's inner circle [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  And you know, nobody else will see the text. It's like just three best friends [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1556.4s)]
*  All three of his best friends are like you'd be totally doing better than curry. He's like, yeah, man [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1560.56s)]
*  I know but it's his olympics but [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1564.8s)]
*  Like because halliburton's kind of perfect for what this team's trying to do, right? He doesn't need the ball that much and he just hits [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1568.32s)]
*  Open threes, but he's gracefully [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1574.3200000000002s)]
*  Stepped aside which I think had a lot to do with the way jaylen brown decision too [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1577.28s)]
*  It's it's weird to watch this team now and think that they wouldn't have picked eric white over over jaylen brown because they really really really [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1581.1200000000001s)]
*  Need derrick white. He's been one of the big winners [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1588.24s)]
*  Drew's been a big winner, but we already knew he was great in this format people reminded that kd was kd, which is funny [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1591.52s)]
*  Booker we mentioned lebron and and then [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1598.4s)]
*  Edwards just does this crazy fun wild card. I think that not not surprising, but he's still been a winner [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1601.12s)]
*  Well also, I think potentially the future face of team usa [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1606.8s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what halliburton in part represents too is an investment in the fact that this guy is going to come back [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1610.08s)]
*  And that's where the derrick white jaylen brown trade-off might hurt like jaylen brown is a guy who four years from now [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1616.1599999999999s)]
*  You may want to be a part of team usa [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1621.76s)]
*  Are you really going to bring drew and derrick white back? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't completely rule it out. I would say especially for derrick white more than drew but [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1626.96s)]
*  Realistically, I think those guys get edged out in four years and jaylen brown could have been a core part of that team [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1631.5s)]
*  well, they'll have to [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1636.96s)]
*  Hash it out with uh, seltzer's owner elon musk [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1638.48s)]
*  When that happens, I can't wait more worst case scenario. It's gonna go great for everybody from the summer [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1641.68s)]
*  um [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1647.6s)]
*  the uh lebron by the way, I think was [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1648.6399999999999s)]
*  plus [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1651.68s)]
*  26 in the first half of that game seems good great. Um, i'll say one last thing about kd [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1653.44s)]
*  I was out on that phoenix team [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1661.52s)]
*  You know just like I the west is so good and it's like, all right, can you pick your four? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1664.48s)]
*  Who do you have? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1669.68s)]
*  And the four for me was pretty easy to pick and then it's like one then two wild cards [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1670.96s)]
*  Then I had phoenix like seven or below. It's like well, what's going to be different this year? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1674.8s)]
*  They're still not gonna have rim protection the katie booker thing is still seems a little weird [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1678.8000000000002s)]
*  What's different then you watch them together. It's like well, all right you add food nolzer [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1685.0400000000002s)]
*  They stole tyus jones. I was about to say I was waiting for the ties jones drop. Holy shit [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1690.24s)]
*  Well, it was ridiculous [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1696.0s)]
*  Like I I feel like they have to at least do forensic analysis of his bank accounts to figure out if there's any extra cash [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1697.3600000000001s)]
*  There's something offshore happening. Yeah, I don't know where the money was moved from the ishby account in the caribbean [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1703.3600000000001s)]
*  but uh, but that he was exactly what they needed and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1708.4s)]
*  You know, I i'm not counting them out on the flip side. We should turn this into canada greece, I guess but or canada [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1712.24s)]
*  france [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1720.24s)]
*  on the flip side [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1722.24s)]
*  I feel so much worse about denver. Yeah than I did two months ago [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1724.48s)]
*  You know, they lose kcp [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1729.8400000000001s)]
*  murray's [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1732.16s)]
*  Just looked just I mean he's the talking point now the entire olympics like what happened to that dude [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1733.28s)]
*  and you go back to his playoffs versus [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1738.96s)]
*  2023 and then [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1741.98s)]
*  31 three-point shooting in the playoffs this last year [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1743.52s)]
*  It's not getting to the line in the same way [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1746.96s)]
*  No, and you were talking about the side by side of pulling up old jason tatum tape and comparison it to now [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1748.96s)]
*  If you are a nuggets fan, do not do this with jamal murray. He he does not move the same [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1754.48s)]
*  He doesn't navigate the floor the same everything mechanically people. Absolutely [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1758.96s)]
*  Not like the idea of him as a finisher around the rim [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1763.04s)]
*  He was a guy who was challenging [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1766.24s)]
*  Like maybe not prime lebron, but still like gently post prime lebron at the apex dunking over him [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1768.24s)]
*  That was who jamal murray was that seems unfathomable right now [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  He was 27 a game in 23. He seemed like he was his generation's big game guard [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1779.12s)]
*  That was just going to be in all these playoffs doing stuff and maybe it'll come back [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1785.2s)]
*  Maybe there's some injury we don't know about maybe he's a little out of shape, but [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1788.6399999999999s)]
*  Canada was playing for their life today and they lost. Yeah [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1793.04s)]
*  And he wasn't out there [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1796.24s)]
*  So you take that piece? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1798.0s)]
*  You take the fact that the west is better [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1799.84s)]
*  And you know as as as a giant yokich fan i'm concerned [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1803.36s)]
*  I I just think like like what happens [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1809.04s)]
*  They're a weaker team and murray's worse and the west is better [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1812.8s)]
*  Why would I feel great about this season called the nuggets like they to me they look like a clear [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1816.8s)]
*  A clear under and murray will see will this [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1821.68s)]
*  Will this inspire something is this some sort of? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1824.8s)]
*  Hey, man, I gotta look in the mirror [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1828.0s)]
*  But you're losing minutes to dylan brooks when dylan brooks is one for nine and whipping [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1829.44s)]
*  Bricks off the backboard in a must-win game. That's embarrassing [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1834.8s)]
*  I I think if there is an under to hit on the nuggets, it should probably be hit [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1838.72s)]
*  They the lesson of last season for them [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1843.52s)]
*  It seemed like internally was they pushed too hard to stay in that race for the number one seed and it ended up costing [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1846.0s)]
*  Them in terms of energy [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1851.76s)]
*  They just felt depleted kcp even said that he thought they probably should have lost that series to the lakers which fair point [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1853.1999999999998s)]
*  They had to come back and basically all of those games [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1859.04s)]
*  I I heard that I thought that was stupid [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1862.08s)]
*  I mean the lakers the lakers couldn't close in fourth quarters for two years like that [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1865.12s)]
*  They were they were one team for the first three quarters another team for the last quarter and that's who they were [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1869.6799999999998s)]
*  But at the point where you're having to make 20 point comebacks to win [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1874.4s)]
*  I understand that part of his point that part of it is a bad sign [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1878.24s)]
*  And to me is an omen they will take this upcoming regular season a bit more slowly as if [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1881.52s)]
*  Honestly as if they had a choice without kcp. They're gonna have to play younger guys julian straw there. Guess what? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1886.8000000000002s)]
*  You're gonna have to get real rotation in it. You're into the fire, you know, like payton watson [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1891.68s)]
*  These guys are gonna have to actually get minutes and michael malone [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1896.0800000000002s)]
*  Against all of his instincts is gonna have to trust some of these guys and find ways to trust them and find [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1899.28s)]
*  Ways to invest in them the result of that might be that in the long game [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1904.16s)]
*  They're a little younger and a little more athletic and maybe some of those guys hit in the regular season [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1908.64s)]
*  They're just not going to win as many games and with phoenix as a contrast [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1912.64s)]
*  Phoenix won 49 games last season [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1916.4s)]
*  They just brought in as you said mike budenholzer a great regular season coach who is going to help them win more games [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1918.48s)]
*  And they actually have point guards [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1924.96s)]
*  I I would be very surprised even with all of their injury concerns if phoenix doesn't wind up in the mid-50s. That's just [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1926.8000000000002s)]
*  Where I am penciling them in at this point in the case against them is durant year 18 [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1933.52s)]
*  Yes with with real miles and real injury miles on them. What do you think denver is over under is on fandall just out of curiosity [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1937.44s)]
*  Oh my gosh [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1943.84s)]
*  47 wins [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1947.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I thought it was going to be like 48 49 right now. It's 51 and a half 51 and a half [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1948.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's just I to me that is I don't think absolute. Uh [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1954.56s)]
*  In absolute oversight in a conference, it's like 13 deep. Yeah [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1959.12s)]
*  So then you go west western conference odds right now. Okay, c Minnesota dallas denver's fourth [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1964.08s)]
*  Um, okay sees the leader at three to one phoenix is fifth [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1970.6399999999999s)]
*  The lakers at 18 to one or six i'll book all the lakers action if anyone wants to make lakers conference. That's uh pelicans [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1975.52s)]
*  grizzlies [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1982.62s)]
*  21 where are the grizzlies their eighth 21 to one [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1983.6s)]
*  Give me that over. Yeah, the grizzlies are going to win more games than the nuggets. I'm with you. I'm with you [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1988.0s)]
*  Can I throw I thought about this? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1993.6000000000001s)]
*  Admittedly I overrated international basketball and the connections of players like I was telling saruti yesterday [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=1997.04s)]
*  Like I just don't know how orlando doesn't have shooter like just go get him [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2001.8400000000001s)]
*  He plays with the vogners go get him in banga. Just go get just four german national team [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2006.16s)]
*  Yeah, just get four germans. They all play great together [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2012.16s)]
*  I never understood why teams didn't do this with spain [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2014.56s)]
*  in the late 2000s early 2010s like [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2017.6799999999998s)]
*  Shooters great with those guys orlando doesn't really have a point guard, but I was thinking the same thing with denver because the out for denver [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2020.72s)]
*  Is a michael porter trade so I know it's summer vacation, but picasso is still he's still painting the trade machine every once in a while [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2028.0s)]
*  But I was thinking like porter three years left [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2034.8s)]
*  Pretty sizable like he's in the high 30s. Hey in the 40s [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2037.6s)]
*  Bogdanovich on atlanta [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2042.1399999999999s)]
*  Who yokage plays really well with who can do a little like discount murray with yokage moving off the picks and he [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2043.92s)]
*  Didn't have a great game today, but he knows I'd do it [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2050.32s)]
*  Bogdanovich and deandre hunter [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2053.5s)]
*  for porter [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2055.92s)]
*  Who says no [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2058.64s)]
*  Maybe both [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2061.36s)]
*  A double no, I think it might be a double now. I think it might be a double hang up [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2063.12s)]
*  I think if you're the hawks [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2067.12s)]
*  Porter's I know he's coming off of a very healthy season [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2069.04s)]
*  But I think in a larger sense is still an injury risk and frankly as as more of a primary option [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2072.08s)]
*  We haven't really seen it and I don't know if I would really trust it. I I like his role in denver [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2078.16s)]
*  I think that's probably what he's best suited to do maybe a little more creation than that [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2082.16s)]
*  But ultimately he needs someone like yokage to play off of yeah [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2085.92s)]
*  I don't know that tray young. I don't think I feel that way about tray young. What about how about all right? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2089.76s)]
*  Let me make the case for atlanta. Yeah, we just took rissa. Shea [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2093.92s)]
*  Six foot nine, they certainly did that's the thing that they did for offensive in theory playmaking forward [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2097.68s)]
*  Now we get porter jr. Six foot ten. Okay playmaking forward now [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2104.64s)]
*  We got little size of the forwards with their guards and [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2108.88s)]
*  They need to make a two-for-one anyway. That's what I was thinking [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2112.32s)]
*  but I don't know if that's the right move for denver, but it's something like that where I think [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2114.64s)]
*  They're gonna have to split porter and get two guys out of it [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2119.52s)]
*  Because I don't I just don't think they're gonna have enough with the way the league's gone [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2122.64s)]
*  The league's too deep you you need like seven [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2125.68s)]
*  seven really good [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2129.52s)]
*  Spots at this point and they don't have it. That is the natural trajectory [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2131.3599999999997s)]
*  But it depends on jamal murray being jamal murray because if your core is [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2135.7599999999998s)]
*  Yokich and erin gordon who's a really good player but somewhat limited as a score in certain matchups and this version of jamal murray [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2140.14s)]
*  That's just not enough offense like you need porter's explosion in those circumstances in ways that crazy [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2147.44s)]
*  It's it's a precarious place to be this is bad man. Yokich is he's important. He's [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2153.44s)]
*  You know, he's he's like a big diamond in the safe. We gotta take care of this dude [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2159.76s)]
*  The good news is i don't want him to be on like half-assed teams that aren't very good [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2164.08s)]
*  Well denver at least passes him the ball. That's one thing that is I come to appreciate more after today [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2168.2400000000002s)]
*  serbia australia, which was an incredibly fun game [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2174.48s)]
*  And in the second half [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2180.16s)]
*  Well, first of all australia made [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2182.3999999999996s)]
*  It felt like every shot they took I think they were 17 for 21 at one point ridiculous patty mills [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2184.64s)]
*  He had flames shooting out of his ass. He's patty mills by the way. Yeah, this is like [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2190.08s)]
*  Four years from when that should have been an option [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2194.7999999999997s)]
*  and uh, and at some point it was like hey guys, can you guys just [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2198.0s)]
*  Let joker kind of handle this. What do you think? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2202.16s)]
*  There's an idea just be involved just participate [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  How about throwing them a couple entry passes and then it became clear [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2206.8799999999997s)]
*  There was like one and a half guys in their team that could actually throw them an entry pass [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2209.44s)]
*  Yes, they were they're lobbing entry passes to like his the wrong shoulder. He's he's yelling [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2213.04s)]
*  Have you ever seen yokage yell at his own teammates? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2218.64s)]
*  He's like what the fuck man just like i'm watching on tv in my glasses [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2221.12s)]
*  And i'm like I could fucking throw this guy an entry pass at this point, but they hung around [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2225.84s)]
*  and then [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2230.56s)]
*  In the in the overtime after mills makes this crazy shot to send it into ot [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2231.6s)]
*  Yeah, and then it felt like that australia was gonna win and then yokage just took over the last two minutes like it [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2236.32s)]
*  Just felt like he was [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2240.8s)]
*  Defensive stoppers, yeah, nicola yokage his hands were everywhere. He's making plays and and it was just a classic [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2242.1600000000003s)]
*  We have the best part in the court. We're not losing what jumped out of the game for you [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  I think it was I think well look the fact that serbia [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2252.0s)]
*  Led australia build a 24 point lead [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2255.36s)]
*  Did not go to yokage on any kind of consistent basis and at times it seemed like a bit it seemed like they were actively trying [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2258.08s)]
*  To not do it [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2263.84s)]
*  I would say vasily michich was maybe the the greatest defender. There was a point over time where I thought I thought he was sabotaging the game [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2266.0s)]
*  I I have text the house where I was like this motherfucker. What is he doing? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2273.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm so mad [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2277.36s)]
*  I was like because it's one thing if he wasn't an nba player this guy played in the nba last season [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2278.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, and and you have yokage on your team your job's not hard get the ball to yokage and figure out how to play off him [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2283.2000000000003s)]
*  That's your job. He's usually one of the best players on this certain team [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2288.96s)]
*  He was not in this one, but it was it was a pervasive thing like all of a sudden [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2292.56s)]
*  It was just like it's you know, ogen dobrich time. He's gonna he's gonna call his own number [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  God forbid you get the best player in the world the ball on the block or even [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2303.52s)]
*  You run a pick and roll with yokage and actually pass it to him and don't just take the pull up from the elbow like [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2307.2s)]
*  There were so many things that were on the table for serbia that felt fixable [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2312.7999999999997s)]
*  But most importantly they just had to start actually guarding people and it took them the better part of a half to start doing that [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2316.0s)]
*  But I thought once they finally did crank up some of the ball pressure [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2321.36s)]
*  And yokage for whatever his limitations may be defensively at the nba level [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2325.28s)]
*  Athleticism is relative and against international competition and specifically a team like australia [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2329.6600000000003s)]
*  His rim protection is a big deal, right? Like he has a big imposing presence around the rim [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2334.48s)]
*  He's always had good hands and been good at picking and he's good at hitting the ball off the rim [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  He did that a couple times. Yeah straight up saved a clutch layup that patty mills should have had by playing the feba rules [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  So his presence defensively I thought turned out to be a massive impact, but it's I mean just tough for australia [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2348.56s)]
*  They had this thing and patty and josh gitty too. I thought played a really good game, but as it slowed down [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2353.92s)]
*  Their entire offense became patty mills attacking an iso and that it just didn't have it [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2360.48s)]
*  To the point that it seemed absurd and then of course he made the shot to send it over time [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2366.0s)]
*  It's like guys this isn't working. Let's go to plan b [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2370.96s)]
*  I was the one of the best things about [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2374.4s)]
*  feba and olympics and especially a day like this is you're [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2376.8s)]
*  Sending texts to people like why aren't they trying to set up jack mcbay? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2380.0s)]
*  They should be running off things. It's like I didn't know who jack mcbay was a week ago, but now you're invested. Yeah now i'm in [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2383.76s)]
*  giddy island [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2391.2000000000003s)]
*  Controversial island. Yeah, um unless you're the chicago bulls front office in which case you're all in baby [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2393.26s)]
*  I feel like russell and I maybe there are a couple more people out there [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2399.2000000000003s)]
*  But we were like the only ones who really like this trade for the bulls like i'm still in [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2402.32s)]
*  Really like I really genuinely liked it for the bulls. I thought they won the trade. He's 21 [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2406.88s)]
*  There's just a lot there and i'm like if i'm the bulls why not? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2412.5600000000004s)]
*  I thought the wizard should have got him. There's a couple teams where it's like what are you guys doing? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2415.84s)]
*  Yeah, let's go go get this. It's not like he's 27. It's 21. He's got this huge resume already [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2419.1200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2425.52s)]
*  I I saw nothing in this tournament to make me change my opinion. I thought he looked [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2426.8s)]
*  You know, he's still missing some stuff, but he's a young player. I just I just like his game [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2431.36s)]
*  I think he's additive and he plays hard and rebounds and get to the basket and he made a couple corner threes today [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's honestly been hitting his threes throughout this tournament. The shorter line does him a lot of good [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2441.92s)]
*  Needless to say if you can actually hit nba threes, that's a different kind of player, right? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2447.6000000000004s)]
*  I think the who's the announcer I forget who it was but the announcer made that point. This is a better [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2451.04s)]
*  Yeah, three point line for him and it's like that extra two feet sometimes can just kill somebody [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2456.72s)]
*  It can make a huge difference. I think where i'm a little bit apprehensive is [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2461.68s)]
*  When the game starts to go sideways and you could feel this as australia's lead was starting to slip away [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2465.68s)]
*  He gets frazzled and his decision making he struggles with it and some of that's like this is classic young player shit [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2471.04s)]
*  Everybody goes through that on some level or another he's going to get better at some of those things [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2477.68s)]
*  What worries me is when he tries to blow by guys? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2482.7999999999997s)]
*  Because he's not the most athletic he picks up the ball pretty early and then just tries to make things happen [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2486.3999999999996s)]
*  And he's his great vision and he's big so oftentimes he can [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2490.96s)]
*  But then when he can't it just leads to terrible turnovers [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2494.72s)]
*  And so for a guy who's already a little sheepish about shooting who's committing bad turnovers and the decision making isn't great [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2497.8399999999997s)]
*  The idea of putting the ball in his hands and running offense through him all the time [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2504.64s)]
*  I don't love and if you're not, you know what rob mooney, you're not invited on giddy island [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2509.04s)]
*  I'm honestly fine. You stay in your country. I don't I don't think I want to participate in what's going on on giddy island [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2513.84s)]
*  The uh [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2521.44s)]
*  What what uh my from my notes del vadova crunch time minutes with three exclamation points was also in my notes [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2523.2000000000003s)]
*  You got to stop on yokich that could have been one of the biggest plays of the game [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2529.76s)]
*  But it was out of what the 2015 finals what finals was that when he was doing stuff? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2533.44s)]
*  I don't it was [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2539.2s)]
*  Nine years ago. Was I still a great land? I don't even remember [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2540.7999999999997s)]
*  They had to plug ivs into him because he was running himself to exhaustion [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2543.52s)]
*  He might still need an ivy from this game, but playing much fewer minutes. It's just a you know, he's at a different point in his life [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2546.7999999999997s)]
*  It was really funny. Um [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2552.64s)]
*  Dyson daniels speaking of young players. Yeah, it's funny that he's on this team with exum [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2554.64s)]
*  Because to me he's just exum 2.0. He's the evolutionary. Yeah. It's like i've already seen [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2560.64s)]
*  Seen this um, he's been shooting a little better in fairness to him, but like he doesn't get guarded [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2566.3199999999997s)]
*  He needs to prove a lot in terms of actually finishing and attacking it is [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2571.2s)]
*  Why why do all these ozzy guys turn out the same way? Maybe it's a weird like [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2574.96s)]
*  Ozzy rules football kind of influence or like a cross-sport thing. I'm not understanding but they're such good open floor players [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2578.96s)]
*  Yeah, and danta xm had the same problem when the game slowed down [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2586.0s)]
*  He just doesn't have a lot that he can do in a game like this [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2589.7599999999998s)]
*  But when the game is open, he's an incredible force [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2592.48s)]
*  I think dyson daniels if he can figure out a way to be kinetic and active [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2595.12s)]
*  In some kind of half court setting is going to be a really good nba player because he can sure guard the hell out of the ball [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2598.96s)]
*  I like that. Uh [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2604.64s)]
*  I like the the move him switching teams. I think will help him. Oh, yeah. Yeah [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2606.32s)]
*  I that's kind of just wanted to see on like a not a very good team just getting getting minutes. Um [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2609.84s)]
*  So serbia's playing the u.s [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2616.2400000000002s)]
*  In the line right now in fandel is usa minus 16 and a half [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2618.4s)]
*  That feels right [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2622.56s)]
*  Yeah, you could tell me that we went by 38 [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  And you could tell me we're sweating this out [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2626.8s)]
*  I don't think I don't think they're going to sweat it out. What are you saying? So you should pick the 38 option [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2630.08s)]
*  I'd pick the 38 in particular [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2634.16s)]
*  You you got a sense of it in this game [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2636.64s)]
*  But serbia's shooting is so streaky and when they're not hitting their open shots [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2638.2400000000002s)]
*  They just kind of fall apart offensively [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2643.12s)]
*  They don't have a lot that they can do when they're not running through yogic and capitalizing on the things he creates [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2645.36s)]
*  And the fact you know what they have though. They have some some really ugly post-up players [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2650.72s)]
*  They have some guys there. Who's that guy who did the 540? Oh my god [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2655.9199999999996s)]
*  He was trying to do the 540 degree mccale jump turn around flip the other way and it just like whipped it off the backboard [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2660.3999999999996s)]
*  Petrasha like we gotta relax petrasha like please know your job petrasa [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2666.54s)]
*  Know your role know your role. Honestly, too many guys on serbia's team need to know their roles in [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  A way that is a little bit concerning for me if you're trying to project their chances [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2677.1200000000003s)]
*  Especially like how are they going to beat team usa? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2681.04s)]
*  What would they have to slow down the americans perimeter defense isn't really it you saw patty mills and josh getty light them up [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2683.04s)]
*  The size is a real thing [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2689.44s)]
*  And in particular yogic does really well against ad does really well against bam historically [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2691.6800000000003s)]
*  Embiid can be a bit of more of a give or take matchup [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  And maybe that's his most important matchup in this entire bracket is what can embiid do on ball against yogic and can he give you [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2699.04s)]
*  Good minutes there that could be a real thing. It felt like they rope adoped a little bit against america when they played them [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2705.12s)]
*  Before because we know what's going to happen when we get to the medal round like yo, who is the dope who got roped? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2712.08s)]
*  Well, I think there's another gear to go with with yogic [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2718.16s)]
*  Oh, you know there's a scenario where he just doesn't come out of the game [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2722.4s)]
*  Because as soon as he comes out of the game [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2725.92s)]
*  They were doing it today because australia kept putting him in pick and rolls and I felt like australia's game plan was to try to wear him down [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2727.92s)]
*  Which I think would be a possibility for america [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2734.72s)]
*  But on the other hand if they're going like oh we're gonna run centers at him and try to post him up [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2737.04s)]
*  Like I actually think he's good with that. That's a yeah, what he doesn't want to do is guard devin booker 25 feet away [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2741.92s)]
*  I think that's a way worse. Yeah a way worse outcome [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2748.24s)]
*  Um, but I do feel like there's another gear with them [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2751.2s)]
*  I just didn't feel like [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2754.4s)]
*  It seemed like one of those [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2756.3199999999997s)]
*  The the previous game was one of those we don't want to show you everything [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2759.2s)]
*  I think it's a good thing that they're doing [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2762.48s)]
*  Games by them not that it's gonna matter because america's way better than them [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2765.52s)]
*  But i'm i'm just never counting out yogic. I think nor should you one of the fun things about today was you got to see just three great players [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2769.52s)]
*  in super adverse situations [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2777.28s)]
*  Just kind of coming out of the tv in these cool ways sga was the other one. We'll talk about that game later, but [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2780.56s)]
*  There was a stretch in that uh in that fourth quarter he was just guarding all five guys for like two minutes [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2785.92s)]
*  And he's just like oh my god [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2793.28s)]
*  This is one of the most amazing players the last 25 years and he had everyone on his team let him down [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2794.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I was so mad at every greek guy. It got to the point where you're like [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2799.84s)]
*  Fuck. I wish the nasus. I wish [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2804.48s)]
*  Wish they had tenacis for this he might have helped. Well, they have him as support staff [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2806.88s)]
*  He's still there riling guys up like achilles injury be damned but [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2811.76s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of uh teams that cannot get their best player the ball like nick kalathis did it a couple times with little lobs [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2815.92s)]
*  For yanis, but I forgot how disappointing he was as an nba player. It's like, oh, yeah [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2821.44s)]
*  I was really hoping for better things for him 15 years ago [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2825.92s)]
*  But yeah, they just don't have that second [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2829.28s)]
*  Second thing yanis, you know is what are you gonna do? You're double teaming them. You're triple teaming them [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2832.1600000000003s)]
*  But that game was tied at the half. I know [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2837.2000000000003s)]
*  Another one where greece looked really good when the game was open and as much as it slowed down [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2840.48s)]
*  They just couldn't get in scoring position at all like their offense completely dried up [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2844.88s)]
*  but [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2849.04s)]
*  You're right that this is what's fun about olympic basketball is like superstars in [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2849.92s)]
*  a loaded team usa kind of context that we've never seen them before or [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2854.0800000000004s)]
*  On an international team that really doesn't have the talent to be competitive at all [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2858.5600000000004s)]
*  But they have right or they have yanis or [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2862.1600000000003s)]
*  In canada's case like they should have all the talent to compete but shay is really the only guy who showed up on that team [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2865.2000000000003s)]
*  Today so i've been watching a lot of basketball just because I love basketball [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2870.32s)]
*  And i'll usually watch most versions of it. I will not watch the three on three [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2873.52s)]
*  I stayed away completely of three on three olympics. I don't know you're allergic to jimmer for dead [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2877.12s)]
*  Or hailey baleiff who is it that you're staying away from who is that sport for why did we do this? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2881.68s)]
*  Why i'm watching all the best olympians possible at all these other sports and then where we I I don't know what was going on there [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2886.56s)]
*  I don't know if you saw too there's like it's a different ball that they're playing with three on three who wanted this like why [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  Didn't they ask? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2898.48s)]
*  People like us we really like to give them [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2899.84s)]
*  Feedback because you watch that and then you watch like [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2902.56s)]
*  Cole decker, you know breaking the olympic record and coming back from fifth place on the [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2905.84s)]
*  Last half of the way. It was like a sports movie and then it's like i'm gonna watch this three on three gimmick [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2910.8s)]
*  Um, but i've watched a lot of germany [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2915.2000000000003s)]
*  And I just really like how they play I just [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2918.32s)]
*  I really enjoy their team. I was when it was 36 36. I was like bummed out [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2921.6800000000003s)]
*  because and granted I had them in a parlay, but [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2926.4s)]
*  I was like, oh man, I don't want to lose [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2929.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't want to want to lose these guys yet. I like watching germany. I like the vogners. I like the bonga resurgence [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2931.52s)]
*  Oh my gosh, he's been incredible. I like seeing tice who i've never you know tice for some reason [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2937.36s)]
*  NBA tice versus fiba tice are like two different people and then just schroeder just classic [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2942.32s)]
*  The classic guy who's just way better in this version of basketball for reasons that are unclear [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2948.4s)]
*  Has anyone cracked the code on that? No [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2954.0s)]
*  Now that I mean carlos arroyo was like this sure [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2956.8s)]
*  But this is this is a consistency and a level of performance that just defies [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2960.0s)]
*  Anything that I can explain and I like dennis schroeder as an nba player fine [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2965.2s)]
*  but he's [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2969.84s)]
*  Steve nash on the international stage [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2970.96s)]
*  like does it make you think like are are we doing dennis schroeder wrong like should [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2973.76s)]
*  Should we be letting him cook? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2979.2s)]
*  Is he like one of those actors who's just on the wrong tv shows and it's like this guy's actually an oscar winner [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2980.48s)]
*  And we don't realize it. I don't know what to make of it. I don't either I [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2986.0s)]
*  And to your point about like can you get him to orlando or somewhere like that? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2989.44s)]
*  I don't know that he should be cooking in that context, right? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2992.8s)]
*  Like it's one thing if this is your team, but if your team has palo banquero on it, that guy should probably be cooking [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=2995.36s)]
*  Part of what enables maybe he has the ball too much palo. I mean that was wow [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3001.2s)]
*  No, i'm saying but when they got to that cleveland especially game seven [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3006.0s)]
*  It was like yeah, yeah, palo just it was like palo or bus like I think he needs somebody else [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3008.88s)]
*  He does need a ball handler does he need nba dennis schroeder I would argue no [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3013.6s)]
*  But germany clearly needs fiba dennis schroeder. He how do we get dennis schroeder to be fiba dennis schroeder all the time? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3019.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't because so here's the thing what do you think? What do we do? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3027.6s)]
*  Well, I watched him on the celtics that year and we were all like, yeah [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3032.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, he was on the lakers and everyone was like, yeah [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3036.08s)]
*  Um, but he did have that great okc year. Yeah [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3039.6800000000003s)]
*  Where I think I might have even voted him for six man of the year [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3043.44s)]
*  But I thought he was awesome that year and it seemed like at the very least [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3046.2400000000002s)]
*  he's this [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3050.1600000000003s)]
*  Kind of rich man's version of what a six man is where he can come in and get heat checky [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3051.76s)]
*  but he could also kind of run the team and be out there and crunch time and guard bigger guards and [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3055.92s)]
*  I you know, I still feel like there's a place for him on a good team [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3060.6400000000003s)]
*  I just don't know what the team there has to be a place because he's in brooklyn now. He's in brooklyn purgatown [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3063.52s)]
*  We can't have that he's got to be on at least some contender [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3068.1600000000003s)]
*  The calibration with him is tough and I think some of it is reputation where as he was coming up [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3071.28s)]
*  He was constantly pushing for more and more responsibility and a bigger and bigger role in a way that was [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3076.48s)]
*  Difficult to manage I think in particular in atlanta [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3082.16s)]
*  And as he's evolved as a player and as a veteran he's found some really nice roles for himself [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3085.36s)]
*  Like I thought he did well for the lakers too. I thought he was exactly what that team needed in some respects [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3089.12s)]
*  How can we get him into a comfortable spot where he is both restrained? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3094.08s)]
*  But also has this sort of pop to him this sort of confidence to him [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3098.32s)]
*  Like it's a hard thing to manage to do all of that at once [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3102.0800000000004s)]
*  I think that's part of the reason why he hasn't been as effective in mba. Well, the funny thing is he was like a curry stopper [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3104.4s)]
*  He did an unbelievable job against curry in quotes. Well, but I mean for if you're talking about all guards who's [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3111.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, who's kind of done the best against curry the last five years is probably shrewder [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3117.0400000000004s)]
*  There was that one playoff series where I felt like he really bothered him. I was surprised the lakers [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3120.6400000000003s)]
*  Didn't keep him we have to bring in [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3125.6s)]
*  um the president of team germany steve sorroudi [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3127.68s)]
*  And get his take on on dennis shrewder and whether he'd want him in orlando sorroudi is also an orlando fan. Um, he's [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3131.04s)]
*  I can't believe you've basically [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3137.92s)]
*  You've basically filed for dual citizenship like joe lmb like you're you're I don't know. How does that work? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you just get to go to germany now and like just live there? What would it how does it go? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3146.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I'd love to go there, uh never been seems like an awesome place [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3151.68s)]
*  but it's gonna be awkward if the final is germany usa because like I [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3155.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, what do you do? I i'm not trying to be anti-patriotic, but I don't really care if this us team wins or not [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3160.0s)]
*  I am invested in franz wagner and I think i'd be happier if germany won than I would if you the us won [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3165.9199999999996s)]
*  So you can call me a bad american, but I think i'm just a good orlando magic fan [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3171.2s)]
*  You know what if the heart wants what the heart wants rob the honey like you just recap presumed innocent [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3175.2s)]
*  Sometimes you know carolyn palemis the heart wants what the heart wants [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3181.2s)]
*  You know, you shouldn't go there, but sometimes you can't resist the heart wants andy opst apparently, you know [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3185.4399999999996s)]
*  It's it's tough times, but I respect your decisions even if it is anti-american [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3190.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think with saruti the franz game seven [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3195.68s)]
*  Coupled with the lavish extension. Let's be honest lavish [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3199.68s)]
*  Lavish extension that they didn't need to do yet. It's fine. It's fine. I didn't like it. Well, I got an announcement [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3203.52s)]
*  Thank you rob. Thank you. I got an announcement. Saruti knows this already i'm back in on the extension. I recant my statements [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3209.44s)]
*  What was the time lapse on that? Was that like a month ago? Just no [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3216.0s)]
*  It's like three germany games where i'm like, you know what? I love franz wagner. I'm in wait. How old is he like 22? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3218.64s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing with franz is [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3225.84s)]
*  You just see all these elements of his game where you go like so he has like the turnaround, right? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3228.7200000000003s)]
*  He does the spin move in traffic. He had the two stupid dunks on on france one of them the switch hand against wendy [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3233.28s)]
*  and [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3239.92s)]
*  Like he I said this like two years ago and people laugh whatever like he he doesn't have that many weaknesses overall [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3241.04s)]
*  I'm not saying he's like elite at everything but he's he's pretty good at just about everything [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3246.7200000000003s)]
*  And the shooting just kind of the three-point shooting specifically just kind of dipped [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3251.2000000000003s)]
*  And if that's the only thing if he could just be like, all right [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3255.2000000000003s)]
*  He's gonna be awesome because he's a great team player [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3258.64s)]
*  And I think the fiba thing like you're right. The ball moves a lot more like he's not like an iso type player [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3261.12s)]
*  It's like hey, give me the ball and let me cook like he works with the system [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3266.0s)]
*  And I think that's probably why it works better [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3268.88s)]
*  I'm not as like excited about the possibility of dennis shrewder like trading for dennis shrewder midseason because i've watched dennis shrewder for his entire career [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3271.12s)]
*  And that's clearly not the player you're getting when it comes to nba basketball [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3278.08s)]
*  But yeah, man, like I the franz thing like make him happy. He's clearly good. Let him be comfortable [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3281.2s)]
*  That's why I didn't have any issue with the extension and i'm glad that you're on that side now [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3286.32s)]
*  Yeah, honestly, he projects as one of those stars who can be a b or b plus across the board [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3289.76s)]
*  And those are hard players to understand especially when they're younger if they don't have that takeover skill set [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3295.52s)]
*  But you watch him in these games and especially the way he can use his footwork and his length against some of these teams [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3299.6800000000003s)]
*  He does a lot of the same things in the nba to you know to varying effect depending on the opponent [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3306.0s)]
*  Ideally, you would want him to shoot a little better [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3310.6400000000003s)]
*  But all the all the tools are here like he's going to be a really good pro for a really long time [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3312.4s)]
*  The ceiling is just not quite at superstar level and i'm fine paying him that extension money if i'm orlando even knowing that that's the case [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3317.04s)]
*  Well, we were in this spot with jalen brown [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3324.6400000000003s)]
*  where he clearly was [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3327.2000000000003s)]
*  Was a really good talent that you'd want to keep right and they got a better deal on the jalen contract than I think the franz thing [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3330.32s)]
*  But the argument was like this guy's got a lot of good stuff already like with jalen. It was like he's competitive [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3336.1600000000003s)]
*  He's durable. He's tough. He can guard different positions and maybe he's not ever going to be like a second team all nba guy [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3342.08s)]
*  But he's a really good asset [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3349.6000000000004s)]
*  And then jalen exceeded all those expectations right turned out to be an all-in-one job and he became one of the best 15 guys in the league [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3351.68s)]
*  So I think that's part of the case for franz the thing I love about him and it really comes out in fiba [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3357.92s)]
*  Is he is so fucking competitive? He's a motherfucker [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3362.72s)]
*  I mean he's a 10 out of 10 of like I just dunked on someone and then I ran back to mid court and i'm so excited [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3365.68s)]
*  I'm just going to start pounding the court [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3370.96s)]
*  Like like which is like an animal because his brother his brother might be even more competitive. Oh, yeah [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3372.96s)]
*  Moe is a psycho. You don't want to go full moe. That's the thing [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3378.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, the question for me is how do you build around that competitiveness and that kind of spirit like it's you know team building [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3382.8s)]
*  We've had all these different even think about how they built team usa and they're like we want specific type of guys that play [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3390.16s)]
*  A certain way in the ball that you know, and I wonder with orlando like maybe they should just lean into it [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3395.12s)]
*  Because we saw this happen in hockey [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3400.0s)]
*  The uh, the florida panthers who just won the cup they just went out and got a bunch of pricks [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3401.92s)]
*  Right, and they're kind of they became the team that was like, oh man. I hate the panthers [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3407.44s)]
*  I I hate this guy. I hate this guy and that was kind of part of their identity and maybe [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3412.56s)]
*  Saruti, maybe that's what you need. You need to go bad boy pistons a little bit [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3417.2000000000003s)]
*  But they're not the thing is like they play they're a tough team to play but they're not bad guys, you know [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3420.96s)]
*  They're they don't have a lot of guys. How do you hate jalen sucks? Like how do you hate franz wagner? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3425.68s)]
*  Like I get why you hate moe. You're not evil. You're not it's non-evil [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3429.52s)]
*  It's non-evil provocateurs [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3433.52s)]
*  Yeah, you're just like damn we gotta play those guys tomorrow like that like right, you know, oh man [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3436.16s)]
*  They're so annoying. Yeah, that's what I think you're not far away from that [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3440.96s)]
*  We're dangerously close to you suggesting instead of a no assholes policy an assholes only policy [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3444.8s)]
*  Competitive assholes, but is anthony black having them? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3451.98s)]
*  Yeah, well he I I was saying like I wanted him to play more last year including in the playoffs like I [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3456.24s)]
*  Yeah, what you know, give him the gary harris minutes like I you know [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3460.88s)]
*  You were very downing gary like gary. I still think he's a corpse. He couldn't hit a shot [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3464.0s)]
*  But like hey, what do you get? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3468.24s)]
*  I'm anthony black can give you great defense and not hit although anthony black actually wasn't terrible from three at all last year [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3469.2s)]
*  Um, I don't know that he's like a nice. He's another like nice guy though. They're not like, you know [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3474.48s)]
*  There's no I don't think there's like the russell westbrook thing where they're you know, it's there's like an edge like they have an edge [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3478.96s)]
*  But it's not like a mean edge. It's more of like I'm just pissed off competitive edge. Yeah, and [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3483.68s)]
*  That's why I thought like that's why like this watching that team last year like they're just so likable because they're all young and they love [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3489.84s)]
*  Like yeah cool anthony who's not like, you know, he's he's I don't know. He's defensively that great [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3495.04s)]
*  But like he's just he's a likable guy the team he can go off for a quarter [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3500.0s)]
*  They have a lot of guys like that. He's got that edge, too [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3503.44s)]
*  um [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3506.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think well [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3507.6s)]
*  First plan has to be you got to get bonga. You just gotta do them [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3509.92s)]
*  It's got to get him. What else does a guy have to do? He's just banging huge shots game after game [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3513.44s)]
*  Gotta bring him in and then maybe start eyeing schroeder and figure out maybe like december range [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3519.76s)]
*  Figure out if you can steal him. Maybe it's a buyout from brooklyn [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3525.6s)]
*  Yeah, because that's you're right. It's a shame that he's there [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3529.1200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3531.52s)]
*  But I do love too that the people now watching franz because it does I feel like people are watching franz more sometimes now in the olympics [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3531.92s)]
*  Then even during the mba season without a doubt and to see because it's always like oh, yeah franz like he's you know [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3538.4s)]
*  He's kind of not that athletic, but he's actually super athletic [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3543.6s)]
*  He's insanely athletic and it's it's funny to watch people like in real time realize like oh he's a sick athlete [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3546.56s)]
*  so [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3552.72s)]
*  to recap [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3554.4s)]
*  I'm backing on the franz extension [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3556.0s)]
*  And sarut is running for germany over the usa. Those are the two things we've learned. It's a tough stance to take but [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3558.48s)]
*  I don't blame I don't blame you man if it was like [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3565.52s)]
*  a case of like a if a young [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3568.48s)]
*  Celtics team that hadn't won in forever and one of our best guys and his brother were playing on another country and it was [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3571.12s)]
*  Great for my team long term if they won. I don't know how i'd root against that [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3577.28s)]
*  Like we won us has won 88 medals already [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3581.92s)]
*  Exactly if paula was on the team like maybe i'd feel differently although he probably would be playing. I don't know like it [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3585.44s)]
*  I just don't care as much the u.s wins or not. I don't [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3591.12s)]
*  All right. So thanks to rudy [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3593.92s)]
*  Thanks guys. Um, all right back to uh, germany and france [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3596.16s)]
*  We did not talk about the france game mahogany [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3601.28s)]
*  Germany is minus four and a half over france [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3604.32s)]
*  and [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3607.76s)]
*  I watched france [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3608.88s)]
*  I thought france was going to lose today. They were a fucking mess [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3610.8s)]
*  For weeks with no signs of hope [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3615.44s)]
*  Including against germany we should note. Yeah, they just looked awful [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3618.32s)]
*  and it was just like what is this team and they had a couple guys I liked but [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3622.48s)]
*  Um, they did some dramatic changes today [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3627.12s)]
*  Now gobert finger injury. I [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3630.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I have some questions. Why didn't that come out? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3634.16s)]
*  Before the game not i'm not calling anyone a liar. It just was like, hmm [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3638.0s)]
*  His own coach kind of called him a liar [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3643.6s)]
*  Rudy gobert said he had surgery on his finger yesterday [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3646.64s)]
*  And his coach corrected him and said actually no he had an mri. He got some treatment [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3650.3199999999997s)]
*  Also [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3656.4s)]
*  He said he wanted to play smaller in this game anyway, which is ultimately what we saw right taking gobert out of the starting lineup [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3657.44s)]
*  Replacing him with like I think we got to get your thoughts first and foremost on olympic x-factor gershon yabu seling [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3663.52s)]
*  How are you feeling about this emergence? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3669.04s)]
*  listen [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3671.2s)]
*  another feather in danny angel's cap [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3672.48s)]
*  Some people are questioning that pick of 2016 including myself and now it's he's been vindicated yet again the man [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3676.7999999999997s)]
*  Someday this will be the first line of his obituary the guy who believed in gershon yabu seling [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3682.8s)]
*  I texted uh, chris ryan in the wayne jenkins voice [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3687.84s)]
*  God damn yabu seling. I didn't realize you turned into charles barkley [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3691.84s)]
*  First of all, he's in shape [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3698.32s)]
*  Looks great [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3699.92s)]
*  He was fat on the celtics like he just could never get in shape and he was like a guy that they really liked [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3700.7200000000003s)]
*  That they thought could be this giant x-factor [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3705.92s)]
*  And kind of like a like a discount barkley potentially and he just was never in shape and they gave up on him [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3708.7999999999997s)]
*  He couldn't shoot threes [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3714.3199999999997s)]
*  now he's [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3715.7599999999998s)]
*  refashioned himself as [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3716.7799999999997s)]
*  He's in shape. He can shoot threes and he's got a really good game and I I thought [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3718.64s)]
*  you know [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3723.92s)]
*  Should we give france the the coach? Should we? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3724.8799999999997s)]
*  give him shit for [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3728.24s)]
*  Maybe taking what a month to realize gobert and runby couldn't play together [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3730.16s)]
*  How could I tell him that three weeks ago try it you gotta try it [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3734.64s)]
*  They couldn't play together. They couldn't play but [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3738.4s)]
*  We get to uh, we get to this round and he's like, you know what these guys can't play together and guess what? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3740.96s)]
*  Everyone's here to see wemby. So rudy you lose and that was it [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3746.3199999999997s)]
*  So lasor who was awesome in this game and i'm watching and i'm going [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3750.16s)]
*  Man is this guy who has his nba rights? This is like the most tom tibetot player i've ever seen in my life [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3756.24s)]
*  and I look it up and it's like [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3761.2s)]
*  The new york nicks have lasor's rights dating back to some trade from I don't know how many years ago [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3763.3599999999997s)]
*  um [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3768.64s)]
*  That guy could play for the nicks. Oh, yeah [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3769.52s)]
*  If taj gibson can play nba minutes matthias lasor can play nba minutes. Yeah, so lasor unstoppable in this game [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3772.24s)]
*  Unstoppable lasor and yapiseli together. It was like they were like fucking the bruce brothers [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3779.3399999999997s)]
*  And I thought wemby did not have a good game [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3784.64s)]
*  He did some good stuff on the defensive end, but offensively was just bad [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3787.2s)]
*  Yeah, low scoring game of the entire tournament so far fornate a couple big shots [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3790.64s)]
*  But for the most part like he didn't even they didn't even start him [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3794.88s)]
*  um [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3798.48s)]
*  But it was those two guys that won the game for them. And then uh, what was the other guy cordon? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3799.52s)]
*  Cordonar [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  Cordonier isaiah cordonier [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3805.28s)]
*  You were so close. You knew I was gonna mess it up [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3807.44s)]
*  You're on fire. I was on fire for a second there cordonier, but he was good in the last couple games [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3810.72s)]
*  He was one of those guys like he would come in and be like, why don't they play that guy? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3816.4s)]
*  um [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3819.8399999999997s)]
*  But uh, I I thought they legitimately won the game and played really well and I was shocked [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3821.12s)]
*  By the murray piece [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3826.7999999999997s)]
*  I was shocked by how bad dylan brooks was and that they just kept him in horrendous [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3828.64s)]
*  I was shocked that I said the words at some point. They really missed zac eddie [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3833.2799999999997s)]
*  The guy who hasn't played an mba game yet. Yeah, I felt like they genuinely missed them. They don't have any centers [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3839.12s)]
*  They were so desperate [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3844.3999999999996s)]
*  They were just like rolling ken burrsh out there hoping that it would it would make up for some of the rebounding some of the effort and [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3845.36s)]
*  Look jamal murray does deserve criticism. He played terribly did not do the thing [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3850.8s)]
*  He was brought there to do which is be a secondary scorer along with shea could not deliver [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3855.1200000000003s)]
*  I also would point the finger at dylan brooks and lou dort and andrew nemhart all the guys who are supposed to bring edge to team canada [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3860.48s)]
*  Yeah, they lost the energy game, right? Like they lost to cordonier on those on those grounds to lasor on those grounds [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3868.1600000000003s)]
*  To yabu selle, they were getting bodied inside if those guys can't play bigger than they are [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3874.56s)]
*  Team canada's whole formula falls apart and they didn't even get close [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3879.76s)]
*  Well, I don't want to make excuses for them, but i'm about to [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3884.4s)]
*  I had a couple friends that were at the game the home home court advantage was legit and loud and impactful [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3887.92s)]
*  And it was impactful immediately. It really lifted the france guys [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3894.88s)]
*  and I think from [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3898.7200000000003s)]
*  from a canadian standpoint [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  When you're you played together, but [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3903.04s)]
*  You haven't played 100 games together. You know, you haven't played 50 games together. You're still a little bit thrown together [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3905.8399999999997s)]
*  You've had some practices. You've had some warm-up games. You've been in the olympics. You haven't been in that [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3910.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, and it's it's like the difference of [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3915.68s)]
*  um [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3918.48s)]
*  You know, we'll see in the playoff sometimes or it's like oh what a nice story and then we'll get to a game seven [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3919.6s)]
*  And you'll see a young team on the road and they just like deer in the headlights [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3923.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought there was some deer in the headlights stuff with them, which is surprising because [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3927.52s)]
*  A lot of those guys have been in big games, but that's when you start losing the 50 50 balls and bricking threes and [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3931.2799999999997s)]
*  um, I thought the crowd really affected them and I I was shocked because they were france was eight point underdogs [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3937.8399999999997s)]
*  And at no point was like i'm gonna like house loved france house was like i'm not sold on canada home court [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3944.96s)]
*  Blah blah blah, but I was like, I don't see it. I watch all these france games. They suck [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3951.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't I don't care how good the crowd is but the crowd [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3955.52s)]
*  Lifted them the crowd was a huge deal. I think the counterpoint to that is [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3958.3199999999997s)]
*  I do think the crowd effect is real. It it sounded loud as hell and it sounded like an incredible atmosphere [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3963.2s)]
*  Separate from that to your point about canada kind of getting affected and letting themselves get rattled [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3969.12s)]
*  Inexplicable letdowns are kind of a way a way of life for canada basketball [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3975.5s)]
*  This is what they do is they roll into these tournaments with lots and lots of talent [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3979.6s)]
*  And it never quite matches up to what it should be and like there's a reason why even though they finally got to bronze [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3984.08s)]
*  in fiba last year [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3990.0s)]
*  other than that [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3991.6s)]
*  They haven't had a medal in an olympic since 1936 despite the incredible influx of talent, especially post vince carter [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3992.8799999999997s)]
*  Like it's it's been a renaissance, right? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=3999.2799999999997s)]
*  It's been an incredible surge within the country and they just can't deliver and it's because it never quite [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4001.12s)]
*  Never never quite comes together the way it should they don't have the bigs which is a huge issue [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4006.48s)]
*  Like dwight towel cannot be your starting center against this little competition. What happened with zac ade? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4011.12s)]
*  Why didn't he play? Well, I never got a good answer on that. He's hurt right now [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4015.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that what it was maybe it's that maybe it's just trying to get ready for the mba season [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4018.96s)]
*  I don't I don't know the exact reasoning behind that [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4022.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, the other one who didn't play [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4025.3599999999997s)]
*  So there were two german guys [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4027.68s)]
*  last year maxi cleba [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4029.68s)]
*  He did I guess he didn't play in the warm-up tournament [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4031.52s)]
*  And germany got pissed and like you're not going to play in the team and schroeder went at them and there was a schroeder maxi cleba cleba beef [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4034.56s)]
*  That was weird. The other guy they didn't play was heartenstein. Yeah, and it didn't seem like a big deal last year [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4041.12s)]
*  It was like oh my god is a heartenstein is not going to play for team germany [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4046.24s)]
*  And then a year later, it's like isaiah heartenstein is getting [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4049.7599999999998s)]
*  89 million dollars from okoma city and it's just like in [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4053.12s)]
*  You know improbable playoff force [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4056.64s)]
*  And meanwhile moe vogner almost fouled out of this game on offensive fouls alone in like 15 minutes [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4059.44s)]
*  I I would have bended my rule of you had to play with us last year like [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4064.3199999999997s)]
*  He's right there. I don't know the story behind it. But if you put heartenstein on that team, yes [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4068.64s)]
*  That's a real threat for the u.s. Now [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4075.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they already are a real threat like they are but i'm saying like now it's now I can see a path [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4078.32s)]
*  Yes for for something to happen. It feels like they're a big guy short to me [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4083.76s)]
*  Yeah for canada. I think they are a big guy short too [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4088.16s)]
*  At least at least one maybe probably one and a half. Yeah, I mean they have some decent players [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4090.8s)]
*  it's just not quite the balance that they need but [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4095.28s)]
*  There's something fundamental happening there that they need to sort out and it's weird because the pecking order should be clear in some ways [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4098.16s)]
*  Like shea did do his job and he showed up and created and played and scored well [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4104.8s)]
*  Nothing else was really working and I don't have a good explanation for that given the level of talent involved [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4109.6s)]
*  Yeah, especially like he's played with dork for the last few years a lot of these guys have played together for a long time [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4114.8s)]
*  Dylan brooks is a guy that makes sense for to be a shea teammate. Yep. Um [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4119.52s)]
*  I uh [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4124.72s)]
*  I thought the refs were atrocious [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4125.92s)]
*  Like and this isn't the first time with france. I get it. We're in france [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4128.0s)]
*  They're gonna get some calls the japan game was an absolute that was that was bad was an all-time atrocity [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4131.92s)]
*  I still don't know how rui hatchmore found out of that game like that was super fishy [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4137.12s)]
*  And then the four point play was egregious and it was awful agreed and they should have lost to japan [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4141.52s)]
*  If they lost to japan, they're not in the tournament [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4146.56s)]
*  the stuff today like [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4149.12s)]
*  France probably wins. Anyway, it was one of those days [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4151.5199999999995s)]
*  It was one of those days forneus hitting 40 footers with one second left in the shot clock and just crazy shit's happening [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4153.44s)]
*  but [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4159.44s)]
*  Sga was getting mauled [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4160.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they were just they were like fuck it. There's a lot of not call it [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4162.5599999999995s)]
*  There was at one point they had like a 25 to 8 free throw advantage, but the play that shocked me was fornee [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4166.08s)]
*  Just an easy charge call and they counted the basket. Yeah, i've never [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4172.16s)]
*  Has that happened have you ever seen that happen before I don't think I have honestly [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4177.76s)]
*  I don't hate it as far as like a charge where you count the basket [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4182.08s)]
*  But it's also an offensive foul. I kind of like that as a result [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4185.44s)]
*  I would I wouldn't mind that if there were that were more widespread rule and policy in other leagues [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4188.48s)]
*  But yeah, I can't say i've ever seen it before another thing to review maybe [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4192.88s)]
*  What the list is short another five minute review. You know what? Let's do an automatically triggered review [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4196.88s)]
*  You don't even have to challenge. Let's just let's just tack it on. You know my theory [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4202.16s)]
*  No more black charge reviews ever just take them out not eligible. We'll just take out the charge frankly [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4206.56s)]
*  Well, but just like not eligible like ref calls. It's a judgment call [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4212.8s)]
*  We move on and we never have to see it reviewed from [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4216.64s)]
*  Nine different angles. Uh the Sga that batum was really important in this game and I wanted to mention him he uh [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4220.08s)]
*  It's the type of guy you're thinking like okay. See is basically the favorite in the west [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4227.4400000000005s)]
*  They aren't basically they are the favorite in the west [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4230.88s)]
*  They're positioned the best to be the best regular season team in the west at least denver falling back [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4233.28s)]
*  feels like that opens the door a little for them even more and [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4239.12s)]
*  They have to win four straight playoff rounds so it's like well, how are they going to do that if they're sga-centric well [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4244.56s)]
*  One of the teams in those four rounds is going to have a guy like batum [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4251.4400000000005s)]
*  And it was interesting to watch him struggle at least a little bit with him. Maybe that's a possible game plan for him [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4254.8s)]
*  Putting like a six seven six eight guy on him some size [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4260.32s)]
*  because I [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4264.24s)]
*  Dallas didn't really I guess dallas was throwing [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4265.68s)]
*  What they were putting a little xm on him? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4268.400000000001s)]
*  Who's the other guy they're putting on in that? Uh, what's his face? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4271.12s)]
*  Yeah, they did some cross matching with pj washington swings on him, but [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4275.360000000001s)]
*  I guess that would be the [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4278.88s)]
*  the uh recipe I would say the recipe is is in part nick batum and certainly the ball pressure full court that stuff matters and [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4280.32s)]
*  Wears you down a little bit as you go [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4287.36s)]
*  It's also having victor webin yama on the back line [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4289.12s)]
*  For someone who like shay is one of the best at getting to the basket in the world and all of a sudden that guy's lurking [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4292.08s)]
*  Behind everything. Yeah, that's a pretty big deal. Are you disappointed by how wemby's played by the way? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4297.36s)]
*  I wouldn't say so overall like in the are you in the middle because i'm kind of in the middle [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4302.16s)]
*  I'm not disappointed. I'm not excited. I'm just kind of [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4305.44s)]
*  I don't know how I feel offensively. It hasn't been an ascendant run for him [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4308.639999999999s)]
*  It's been a lot of what we are have already seen which is sometimes he settles sometimes he gets pushed off his spot [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4313.36s)]
*  Sometimes you know the passes to him aren't quite as crisp as you would like and put him in awkward positions [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4319.5199999999995s)]
*  In this game, honestly, I thought it would look better if the three was falling and it just wasn't [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4324.32s)]
*  So that's going to be a reality that he's going to have to learn how to work around [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4328.4s)]
*  But defensively he does wild shit that no one has any business doing like taking outlet passes out of the air [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4331.92s)]
*  that canada is trying to throw or or picking guards in the backcourt and there were those plays where [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4338.32s)]
*  He would turn the ball over or he would miss on kind of an awkward shot and just immediately get the ball back [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4343.12s)]
*  In a way that bigs just don't do that. And so those things are really special plays and frankly [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4348.32s)]
*  What he was able to do defensively? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4353.84s)]
*  Rudy gobert can't do all of that in a game like this and if especially after the surgery [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4356.16s)]
*  We'll see what's going on with rudy gobert's hand, but it is so funny as we're talking about [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4362.5599999999995s)]
*  You know denis shroeder and kind of feet like fiba or olympic fit and the fact that the circumstances change just slightly [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4368.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden everything works [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4374.4800000000005s)]
*  I agree with you that wimby and gobert should not work offensively and it did not work offensively [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4376.64s)]
*  It also should have been better defensively than it was [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4381.6s)]
*  And yet I thought this was france's best defensive game and it was by taking the defensive player of the year off the floor [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4384.72s)]
*  and you know evan fornier in between these games was actually talking about that about like [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4391.68s)]
*  You know, this isn't the 90s anymore to paraphrase him like the best defense oftentimes is having a good offense and a competent offense [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4396.0s)]
*  Which to be fair, of course evan fornier would say that [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4402.639999999999s)]
*  But he was also right and them going smaller. I thought made them so much better defensively [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4405.839999999999s)]
*  Agree. All right. So you mentioned the gobert [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4410.96s)]
*  piece of this [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4414.0s)]
*  Which was pretty predictable [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4415.599999999999s)]
*  Because it was obvious that they were gonna have to pick one of them [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4418.48s)]
*  Do you think rudy gobert playing three minutes and then having maybe a surgery but maybe not a surgery is [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4421.28s)]
*  None of none of that was predictable [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4427.2s)]
*  But that he would be the loser if they decided sure you can only play one of these guys [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4429.2s)]
*  One of these guys is the future of basketball in your country and the other one is rudy gobert [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4433.599999999999s)]
*  One of the things I thought they would do is at least play wimby maybe 26 minutes [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4438.0s)]
*  And play gobert the other 14 as it was happening. I'm like, oh, okay [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4443.28s)]
*  I see what they're doing [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4446.32s)]
*  But then wimby I forget if he got foul trouble or something happened he came out and they didn't put gobert in yeah [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4447.6s)]
*  It's lasso time. I was like, whoa there this this coach is now thinking [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4452.96s)]
*  I lasso and yabaselli. I have a better option to just win this game than with the defensive player of the year [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4457.84s)]
*  And I think it might be time for me to flip-flop on the gobert trade yet again [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4464.64s)]
*  I don't know what what what my career flip-flop is [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4467.92s)]
*  You're very flexible today. Did you do yoga this morning? What's going on? Yeah, maybe it's a summer [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4471.76s)]
*  I'm in a better mood, but you know, I went from doing podcast segments about how I thought minnesota had a chance to be one of the best [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4475.76s)]
*  defenses of all time [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4482.56s)]
*  In the denver series to now [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4484.400000000001s)]
*  Wondering if the gobert trade was a mistake. So i'm back baby. The world makes sense again [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4486.72s)]
*  The gobert trade it was a mistake because gobert is not victor webin yalla. That's the problem. Yeah [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4491.6s)]
*  Yeah, i'm just i'm still workshopping it [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4495.84s)]
*  But now i'm like, you know, I i'm the flip-flop and i'm sure i'll flip-flop back the other way [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4498.400000000001s)]
*  Of course get talked over but right now i'm in the oh my god the gobert trade can't believe it happened [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4503.44s)]
*  wendy offensively reminded me a little of uh [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4508.0s)]
*  first [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4511.759999999999s)]
*  Two months san antonio wendy [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4512.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like he's just kind of he he hasn't figured out how to get near the basket and do wendy spider-man shit [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4515.679999999999s)]
*  Enough. Yeah, but defensively like that one time when he rj barrett kind of stole it from him [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4522.48s)]
*  And then he did the spider-man thing and grabbed the ball back nuts. I've never seen that before [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4527.36s)]
*  In 50 years of watching basketball if I can posit a comparison to those first two months with the spurs and team france [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4531.84s)]
*  Uh, both have a similar problem [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4539.4400000000005s)]
*  No one on the team can dribble the ball [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4541.6s)]
*  And if you're big that creates some issue it was honestly shocking that it took canada until there were like five minutes left in this game [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4543.4400000000005s)]
*  to realize [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4550.08s)]
*  None of these guys can handle maybe we should pick them up full court and pressure [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4551.4400000000005s)]
*  Were the other games did they know they were televised? I don't know. I don't know what what because [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4555.52s)]
*  I had canada as the last piece of my parlay, so I was rooting for can I didn't really care but [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4560.72s)]
*  I was like they don't have anyone who could dribble on their team [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4565.36s)]
*  No, and it was like canada had no clue. I thought their whole plan with the guards was going to be [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4568.8s)]
*  Almost like uh, who is that when indiana played milwaukee in the playoffs and they were just like we're picking everyone up full court [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4574.4s)]
*  We're going you got to go 94 feet against us. We're gonna make it super uncomfortable. They did the opposite [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4580.96s)]
*  It was so strange like you're just gonna let frank nilaquino walk the ball at the floor [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4586.4800000000005s)]
*  Why would you have lou dora and dylan brooks on your team? Why are you doing this? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4590.56s)]
*  And and depth off the bench. It was it was awful and I think their canada coach is going to be the brooklyn coach [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4595.04s)]
*  Yeah, so good luck there jordy fernandez. Okay, so [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4601.04s)]
*  germany france [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4604.8s)]
*  Serbia usa [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4607.52s)]
*  It's felt like usa germany to me for [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4611.52s)]
*  Two three weeks [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4614.4800000000005s)]
*  The home court advantage france had today has me wavering on that a little bit, but I would still [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4616.32s)]
*  At gunpoint probably lean toward germany, but did today change anything? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4622.0s)]
*  Because I think you and I were aligned on like it's germany and us. They're two best teams [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4626.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean i canada seemed like a realistic spoiler until we saw them in a game like this clearly they weren't up to the challenge [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4630.08s)]
*  I think I still feel confident about germany because they almost don't need to play super well [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4636.96s)]
*  They just kind of wear you down and they're stead they're more steady than they are dominant and against a team like france [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4643.04s)]
*  Where the offense is going to come and go a little bit and honestly even in this game [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4649.52s)]
*  Like if cordonnier wasn't hitting from three the way he was hitting and gave them such an early boost with his energy and his shooting [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4653.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe the whole game feels different and those kinds of things can swing between opponents and certainly like when you're against an opponent like germany [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4660.240000000001s)]
*  They're going to grind you down. They do have great depth. They do execute really really well [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4667.84s)]
*  I just think that's going to overwhelm france on a certain level and wendy is going to do some incredible shit [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4672.88s)]
*  and they're going to have their moments, but [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4677.6s)]
*  Even this slightly tweaked version of france's lineup. I don't think is quite up to what germany presents [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4680.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because germany is going to from a competitive physical standpoint. We'll be able to handle the bruise brothers [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4685.84s)]
*  Yeah, they they do have pretty good size certainly better size than canada the bruiset brothers. I'm trying to think of some french. Oh boy [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4692.080000000001s)]
*  Some chinese some french angle on that [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4699.120000000001s)]
*  with with uh [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4703.200000000001s)]
*  with serbia and and the u.s [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4705.120000000001s)]
*  I think you're you're probably right. I'm still there's a piece of me that wonders [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4709.68s)]
*  What happens if yokage is just like fuck these guys and just goes right at them [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4714.160000000001s)]
*  but they were so stupid with how they handled him today that I don't know if they'll have the [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4718.56s)]
*  uh coaching intelligence to be like we've got to survive these first 10 minutes and feed yokage as much as possible [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4722.8s)]
*  in bead versus yokage [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4729.360000000001s)]
*  Does [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4731.599999999999s)]
*  Is there any piece of that that excites you about that game? Of course [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4732.5599999999995s)]
*  Why would it not but i'm saying like for a big picture because it's it's kind of this [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4735.679999999999s)]
*  Little bit of a rivalry. That's not really a rivalry [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4740.4s)]
*  But and then beads ducked a couple of the denver games and it's always like and bead likes when [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4742.96s)]
*  The deck is stacked on his side when he's going to get to yokage. Basically now he has the best team possible [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4747.599999999999s)]
*  and I do wonder [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4752.719999999999s)]
*  you know, I I never know with with uh the mba but there there's always like [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4754.639999999999s)]
*  Especially when it gets american versus foreign, I do wonder if [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4759.6s)]
*  The american teams could be like let's let's try to lay it to yokage a little bit here [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4763.280000000001s)]
*  It's one of the three mvps. He won the title a couple years ago [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4767.200000000001s)]
*  You think they're gonna coo coach him you think well like just we love him bead [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4770.320000000001s)]
*  Because it really does seem like everybody in this team loves each other [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4774.56s)]
*  I do wonder in that first quarter they could be like let's like really try to work yokage with him bead here [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4776.96s)]
*  and [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4782.320000000001s)]
*  Kind of build that rivalry up. I'm just [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4783.6s)]
*  Just throwing it out there. I do think they'll give him his chances like this is the imbeed matchup [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4786.400000000001s)]
*  This is this is the one that's why you have him on this this is why he's on the team [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4790.56s)]
*  And so if you're not going to give him some run here and give him some opportunities. Why did you bring him? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4793.84s)]
*  Uh a couple more quick things for you would the olympics have been more fun if imbeed played for cameroon with siakam and they qualified [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4798.64s)]
*  And it was just imbeed siakam and a bunch of cameroon guys and they're just hanging tough [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4805.84s)]
*  Well, if they did qualify wouldn't that mean they qualified over south sudan one of the best stories of the olympics [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4810.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was more fun fair [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4816.240000000001s)]
*  Uh, why is oscar schmidt? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4818.64s)]
*  Not immediately mentioned as the best olympics basketball player ever when when they like people do they like kd is the best olympics player ever [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4821.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like only one guy ever scored over a thousand points. Yeah [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4827.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, do you ever think 28.8 points in his career? Yeah. Yeah, he put a 46 against 1988 soviets [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4831.68s)]
*  All true 42.3 points a game in the 88 tournament. Yes, I don't know high bar to pass [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4839.04s)]
*  Do you think oscar schmidt is a better basketball player than kevin duran? He's not he's not even close then what are we talking about? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4846.4800000000005s)]
*  We're just talking about the olympics [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4851.84s)]
*  Just shout out to oscar [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4854.24s)]
*  um next topic [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4856.400000000001s)]
*  when does the first [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4858.56s)]
*  You know anthony edwards really loves bam out of bio and eric spolstra. He loved his experience with them [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4861.12s)]
*  Don't be surprised dot dot [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4867.599999999999s)]
*  Story drop [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4870.72s)]
*  I feel like we've we're already seeing am I dropping it right now? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4872.16s)]
*  You might be dropping it now. I feel like i've heard more mumbling about the opposite which is bam going to minnesota [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4875.28s)]
*  Well, not bam specifically but like man ant and kd seem to get along really well, right? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4880.8s)]
*  Like like his favorite player someone he's like idolized and looks up to like [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4885.599999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't that be interesting if those two were to play together somewhere? That's not phoenix [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4889.76s)]
*  Uh in theory alluring kevin duran to minnesota like I think that's the more likely outcome [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4893.44s)]
*  Oh, I like that one [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4898.4s)]
*  Good. I'm glad I brought that up [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4900.08s)]
*  Uh, do you think mark and then saw steve curry playing the olympics and was like i'm actually gonna do the long-term extension on august 7th [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4901.759999999999s)]
*  So you can't trade me for you. I'm good. I don't want to be rude [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4907.92s)]
*  Extremely rude about an all-time great player [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4911.12s)]
*  Is sga this much better than jamal murray or is this just a terrible summer for jamal murray both [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4915.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4922.56s)]
*  I'm really worried about jamal. I think [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4924.32s)]
*  I am too there have always been whispers about work habits stuff with him about [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4926.72s)]
*  I mean obviously there's long-term injury concerns and he has a habit of picking stuff up and getting out for long stretches [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4932.72s)]
*  Like that's always a big deal [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4938.0s)]
*  And that combination is not great and the fact that this is what he looks like even if he is a little dinged up [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4939.84s)]
*  It's a little concerning [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4945.2s)]
*  Who was your favorite failed lottery pick first round pick? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4947.76s)]
*  Or international guy you had high hopes for that you saw in this tournament in a reunion standpoint and we're like, oh that guy [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4951.759999999999s)]
*  I mean bruno caboclo dropping 30 today. I didn't even realize it was happening. He was mine [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4960.16s)]
*  I I gotta say though. I was upset kilian haze wasn't involved in any way because I felt like we're all having a party here [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4966.16s)]
*  For the failed lottery picks. There's a reason he wasn't involved and where's pokushevsky? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4971.92s)]
*  Whatever [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4976.48s)]
*  Why couldn't we have gotten him in there? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4978.4s)]
*  All right, so [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4980.32s)]
*  We're both picking us germany. All right before we go you did presumed innocent [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4981.599999999999s)]
*  So if you if you haven't watched presumed innocent yet, just stop listening to this we can see on thursday. I'll be back [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4985.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, you did presumed innocent with joanna. Yes on the prestige pod you did it not having read the book [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4991.5199999999995s)]
*  Or seen the movie [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4997.759999999999s)]
*  Or seen the movie [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=4999.92s)]
*  You did it you did you were like the la la la put your fingers in [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5002.32s)]
*  Honestly worked very well [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5005.5199999999995s)]
*  I went on the second to last episode with you and joanne and you still hadn't seen it and I was so dying to be [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5006.96s)]
*  Like have the do you think it'll be like the book but we didn't want to spoil it for you [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5011.68s)]
*  Uh, you talked about on the pod but just for this pod [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5016.0s)]
*  Did you like the ending? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5020.08s)]
*  Did you like the twist and then what did you think of the movie version of the same twist? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5022.08s)]
*  The movie version I I do like I think it's executed a little better [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5028.0s)]
*  It I mean it's it's very of its time [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5033.04s)]
*  It's very like look at this crazy woman because women are crazy the the gender politics of the movie are not ideal [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5034.8s)]
*  But I think as a narrative it works better the show putting a twist on a twist [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5042.24s)]
*  Double twist I get what they're doing. I get why they wanted to try that [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5048.0s)]
*  I I thought it was ridiculous. I don't think there's like any narrative foundation [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5053.04s)]
*  For it being the daughter in the end like there's there is not enough groundwork laid and so then it just feels cheap [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5057.62s)]
*  So I agree [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5065.299999999999s)]
*  They didn't set it up at all [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5068.74s)]
*  No a couple of throwaway lines at best I would say [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5070.5s)]
*  Not set up at all. It was just ridiculous and ludicrous what [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5074.66s)]
*  Really surprised me is it seemed like the general feedback and even feedback of people in my life were like [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5078.419999999999s)]
*  Really liked it good season finale. I've heard this a lot, too [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5084.0199999999995s)]
*  The approval rating was was like b plus maybe even a minus and I I was like [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5088.34s)]
*  You're fucking kidding me. It's the daughter like she didn't [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5093.86s)]
*  They didn't hit this at all. We had no I barely even knew who the daughter was [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5097.22s)]
*  It was so bad that joe and I had literally joked about it like four episodes before about how how ridiculous it would be if the daughter [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5101.54s)]
*  Also happened to be at carolyn palmas's house [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5108.74s)]
*  And that's exactly where we ended up like at that point just pick any character. It's like, oh, yeah her swim coach [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5111.379999999999s)]
*  He did it could have been the cat remember you saw it [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5117.7s)]
*  Like he's pick any character who's been on the show. It's like oh that guy jury member number 11. He did it. I just [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5120.9s)]
*  I just thought it was stupid and [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5127.86s)]
*  I even think it would have made more sense if it was the daughter and the son together [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5130.419999999999s)]
*  Sure, and they went over there and then it's like and they're hiding a secret and then it's like you see them [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5134.339999999999s)]
*  Whispering a couple times during the season. It's like yeah, what's going on there? And then it turns out that's what it is [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5139.06s)]
*  This is what was frustrating is in the movie [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5144.26s)]
*  Barbara kills carolyn herself and has been hiding at the whole time [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5147.14s)]
*  The way it was initially revealed in the show was that rusty thought barbara killed carolyn [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5151.22s)]
*  And he was doing all the cover-up and he had posed the crime scene and yeah if it had just if it had actually been [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5157.3s)]
*  Barbara kills carolyn and rusty is covering it up and she doesn't know anything about the cover-up and they're both kind of in the dark [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5163.700000000001s)]
*  As to each other's motives and each other's that's enough of a twist. I love that [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5169.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and they they they did enough to show it to us and then rip it away and say actually [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5174.26s)]
*  Wouldn't that be funny if it's the they did a double actually? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5179.14s)]
*  It's too many well enough to have him being involved in the cover-up. Yeah, we're in and that's enough of a twist. I really like [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5182.820000000001s)]
*  The twist I read the book before the movie, but I really like the twist of like [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5190.02s)]
*  They just all these red herrings and then it turns out to be the wife and then you're seen in the movie where they're in [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5194.660000000001s)]
*  the garage and all this he finds [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5199.38s)]
*  He finds the little axe handle and he solely realizes it was just a great wait. Holy shit. She did it [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5202.18s)]
*  I did not have that feeling with the tv show. No, I will say I still enjoyed the show [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5208.42s)]
*  I still think it's a fun. It's a fun season. It's just a bad finale [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5213.3s)]
*  Unfortunate and I said this to you when I when I popped on your pod like [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5217.22s)]
*  I just I just wish we had more of these like I wish there was another legal thriller on right now that I could watch [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5221.38s)]
*  Well for better or worse, we're getting another season of presumed innocent. I don't know who it's gonna be about [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5227.3s)]
*  Is it about rudy gopher's? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5232.58s)]
*  We're gonna litigate [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5235.54s)]
*  We're gonna bring in the doctor [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5237.78s)]
*  It's gonna be more like anatomy of a fall style because it's obviously the french legal system [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5239.14s)]
*  But let me tell you that's very theatrical in and of itself [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5242.98s)]
*  Well, I give that show a thumbs up [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5246.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I was super frustrated [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5248.18s)]
*  I made a ton of jokes as I watched it when I came on the pod with you [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5250.58s)]
*  I was all ready to throw dirt, but the the second last episode was great [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5253.78s)]
*  I really like I really liked that. I thought that was the best episode of the whole series [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5257.86s)]
*  When it was so much sarsgaard who apparently is not returning for the next season [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5262.26s)]
*  Which that would be the framework that I would want is like let's follow him onto another case [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5266.18s)]
*  That's something I can get behind but if it's not going to be him [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5270.18s)]
*  I don't know if I want the extended adventures of the savage family. That's that's not really what i'm hoping to sign up for [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5273.54s)]
*  Sarsgaard is like yabba sally just clear out let him fucking cook [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5280.26s)]
*  Let him do his thing. He's got a silly. Yeah. All right, rob mohoney [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5284.18s)]
*  Good to see you can hear rob on the ringer nba show and sometimes on the prestige and the big picture as well [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5287.62s)]
*  Thanks for hanging on a tuesday with me. Thanks bill [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5292.74s)]
*  You [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcYZnQM9p50&t=5302.58s)]
