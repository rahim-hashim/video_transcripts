# The Lakers Feel Like a Mess With Van Lathan Jr. | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP5QbuF_ziM)
*  Let's start with the Lakers.
*  Okay.
*  I'm concerned.
*  I would hope so.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But I'm more concerned in an existential way.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm concerned that we are on the precipice of something.
*  A return to the Lakers' ineptitude persisting in a way.
*  I think the LeBron AD era was more of a blip.
*  It's like a momentary interruption in the Lakers' struggles as a franchise and not
*  an indication that they're trending in the right way and that they know what they're doing.
*  Because everything now feels disastrous to me as a Lakers fan.
*  Yeah, we should mention you actually like the Lakers and care about them.
*  I do.
*  I like the Lakers and I care about them.
*  And I'm watching something that I didn't expect to happen.
*  I'm watching guys not want to be Lakers.
*  Since when was that a thing?
*  Why'd you smile?
*  You're such a fucking scamp.
*  I say guys not want to be Lakers.
*  You brought up the Lakers.
*  You light up like it's Christmas.
*  I hope everybody is watching.
*  Bill gets so much joy in this.
*  It's underhanded.
*  It's devious.
*  It's sinister.
*  Well, I think when you've had this many different teammates for the best two guys on the team over
*  the last four to five years and every time it doesn't work out, everyone else gets blamed.
*  At some point, don't you notice that if you're playing for other teams?
*  Oh, if this doesn't work out, I'm the fall guy.
*  All the guys they signed last year are all now available in trades.
*  The usual Russell, Gabe Vincent, Rui.
*  You can have any of them.
*  And last year, they're like, oh, we like this.
*  We're building around these dudes.
*  And it just seems like they built this team.
*  I talked about the top about the clay Thompson signing.
*  It's like exactly what they don't need.
*  Clay Thompson's not what they need.
*  They need defense.
*  They need to be able to defend and get stops.
*  Big picture.
*  What you said, though, I think is the right take because you go back to Kobe tearing his Achilles
*  and you look at the whole run of what happened with the Lakers where basically they hit rock
*  bottom.
*  They made a bunch of draft picks.
*  They had a really young team.
*  You go back and look at the draft picks.
*  They took Brandon Ingram too, which everybody agreed with.
*  And they took Lonzo Ball too in 2017.
*  And those guys didn't really turn out into what we were hoping.
*  But trade everything for Davis once LeBron decides to sign.
*  And then it's just been this uneasy balance of how do you build around these two guys that
*  make two max contracts?
*  It's really hard to do.
*  You need to be super smart as a franchise.
*  You need to draft well.
*  You need to have some luck with for agent signings.
*  And what you pointed out, I think, is the big fear.
*  If you're not getting Klay Thompson, if you're not getting DeRozan to take less to sign with you,
*  you're just going to be shopping in that Christian Wood bargain aisle.
*  And that's where you are.
*  You're with Christian Wood and Jackson Hayes and Kam Reddish.
*  Yeah, Kam Reddish.
*  That's where you are.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funny.
*  You said you got two max guys.
*  You can't build around it.
*  Meanwhile, your Celtics must have the money that Jim and them robbed from Fenway in the town
*  because they're paying everyone.
*  Right.
*  Like they're going to sign pretty soon.
*  It's going to come through the ticket that they've signed Prichard for 40 million a year.
*  Seven years.
*  But that seems low.
*  No, but I mean, this is what happens with the big teams.
*  The Warriors are paying at their noses forever when you have a chance to win a title with the
*  Corps.
*  I guess my question is, do you honestly in your heart think that the Lakers could actually
*  compete for another title with LeBron at the age that he's in and Davis, and then a bunch of
*  different parts and JJ Reddick as the coach and all the good teams that are in the West,
*  and then the Celtics and Knicks and Giannis and Embiid and the other conference?
*  At what point do you just give up the ghost and say it's not happening?
*  And maybe they know that it's not happening.
*  I don't.
*  I don't think that they can.
*  I think that the Lakers are at this point winning conversation piece championships.
*  You stay relevant enough in LA and in sports media culture to keep the brand strong in hopes that in
*  five or six years or some kind of way after LeBron is gone, because he's a relevance piece now.
*  He doesn't really, he's still a great player, but building around LeBron James,
*  I'm not sure when's your championship now.
*  You have never really been able to build around Anthony Davis to win a championship.
*  And those guys still command not just so much money when we're talking about
*  actual money towards the cap and stuff, but there's also a reputation salary cap.
*  There's a cultural salary cap and guys take up space in that way as well.
*  Now, normally when you have players that can take up that much space, you get it back on the court.
*  But one of the worst situations you can be in in any sport is to have a guy take up a lot of
*  your cultural salary cap, your reputational salary cap.
*  And he is not great on the basketball court, not one of the five best guys or one of the three
*  best guys.
*  Don't get me wrong, AD had a fantastic season.
*  He really did.
*  He had a fantastic season.
*  He played great.
*  Maybe one of his best years.
*  But when you don't have that guy and he still demands that type of gravitas,
*  he still has that type of gravitas in the league, it weighs everything down and it makes it hard
*  for you to build around him and win.
*  I thought the Brownie thing was actually smart for them.
*  It's the kind of thing you do when you know you're not going to win a title anymore.
*  I thought it was smart for LeBron to say he would take less to get a free agent because the
*  reality is those free agents probably weren't coming to them.
*  So it looks like he's sacrificing, but who's he sacrificing for?
*  Because he's not going to take less money to get Najee Marshall, right?
*  He's thinking DeRozan, he's thinking Clay, people like that.
*  But ultimately this next season and I think the next couple are going to be about the
*  father-son angle, which is pretty cool.
*  Whether Brownie can play at this level or not, we don't have a lot of evidence yet that he's
*  going to be able to.
*  I would say we have very little, but it's going to be cool.
*  And I think it's the kind of thing you need to do.
*  It's like those last two Kobe years where it was like, hey man, we're not winning the title.
*  This is the Kobe farewell tour.
*  This is how it's going to play out and Kobe's going to take a bunch of shots and people get
*  to come and they get to see him in the home games.
*  I don't know if LeBron is at that stage mentally, but I think you're going to lose enough games
*  to realize that's the stage you're kind of hitting.
*  You're like, yeah, you're an eighth seed.
*  Yeah, you're a ninth seed.
*  That's where you are.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know, those last couple of years, Kobe was really dragging it.
*  Like Kobe, his body was banged up.
*  He couldn't do it anymore, especially at the level that we were used to seeing him do.
*  And you never going to see Kobe, he wasn't going to bounce around to a bunch of teams.
*  Kobe wasn't going to come off the bench.
*  You weren't going to ever see that era of Kobe Bryant's career.
*  That was not going to happen.
*  Right.
*  It's not going to happen for LeBron James either.
*  The thing with LeBron is he's a lesser version of LeBron, but it's still so good
*  that you're flirting with it.
*  You're getting your hopes up.
*  You're thinking, well, maybe.
*  But any other player that played kind of like what he like, like that his game resembled
*  LeBron's game, he wouldn't be such a big deal.
*  So you wouldn't have to think about him constantly like this.
*  You know, the thing with Brawny is interesting because I watched this clip a couple of days
*  ago and it brought it made me smile so big.
*  It was the clip of a pop fly being hit to center in, I think, the kingdom.
*  Yeah.
*  And Ken Griffey Seniors under it.
*  He's got a bead on it.
*  I'm sure you've seen this clip before.
*  Yeah.
*  And out of nowhere, Junior flashes in front of him and grabs it and then he laughs.
*  And I'm thinking, oh, my God, if you're both guys in that situation and if you're watching,
*  how awesome is that?
*  Right.
*  How fantastic is that to watch?
*  Obviously, the difference is that Ken Griffey Junior was probably the best baseball prospect
*  in the world and one of the greatest players of his generation.
*  So there's a difference there.
*  So you see stuff like that and it's part of the story of sports and you want to see it.
*  But if I'm being all the way honest, just someone that comes from humble beginnings,
*  there's something about the Brawny thing that just bothers me.
*  And I talked about it on higher learning.
*  You guys can go listen to it there.
*  But I'm not somebody who has selective views on nepotism based upon who it's favoring.
*  Now, let me make a distinction real quick and then we can get off this because I know
*  it's a topic that makes everybody piss off.
*  It's one thing if I have a business, me handing that business to my children
*  and training them is one thing.
*  Sure, that's nepotism, but that's also getting them ready to navigate their inheritance.
*  When people say, hey, the Jerry Jones gave the Cowboys to his kids.
*  Well, they're going to get the Cowboys.
*  The Bust family is going to get the Lakers.
*  So you're essentially teaching them how to run the team that you already own.
*  Is that nepotism?
*  Sure.
*  But they're going to get the team, right?
*  It's his team.
*  This is different.
*  And it just is.
*  This is somebody utilizing their power to get their kid drafted.
*  I give this the 55th pick, but in a spot that somebody else might have gotten drafted.
*  That somebody else is going to have a harder road.
*  That's not to say that that Bronnie is not going to be a good pro.
*  That's not to say that Bronnie wouldn't have figured it out in college.
*  If he was at a different school and made it to the NBA, I saw some video of him not too long ago.
*  He looks strong, athletic.
*  The jumper looks good.
*  He might end up being a decent pro.
*  But what I'm saying, I'm sorry, but this was wrong.
*  As far as the ideals and the values that I live by, I didn't like it.
*  And that somehow makes me, you know, anti-cultural or I'm hating on LeBron.
*  I'm happy for them and happy for him.
*  He's been through a lot.
*  His body's recovering through a lot.
*  Who knows how his season at USC would have been had he not had the issue that he had.
*  But if I'm taking a step back and keeping it real, that rich boy shit,
*  that's not the type of shit that I'm on.
*  Those are the kind of guys that we used to be like,
*  coach's son that's starting in front of somebody.
*  And there's a cost to that.
*  And I'm not like talking about I've never fucked with that before.
*  So like, why would I start fucking with it now?
*  Just because it's LeBron's kid.
*  The only thing I didn't get is it seems like he should have played one more year in college
*  and had a proper college year at a certain level of competition
*  to try to do really well at that level before he moved to the NBA.
*  I don't understand how you go from high school basketball in LA
*  to not really playing that much for one year in college to all of a sudden.
*  You're basically on the Lakers, but not really.
*  Everything I know about the NBA is there's never practice time.
*  It's a long schedule.
*  You don't have a lot of time to work with the younger guys in the roster.
*  And the G League becomes more important.
*  So if the case is he's going to play in the G League and that'll be his experience,
*  I get it.
*  But I think it just would have been better for him to go to a college for one more year
*  and just try to be an awesome guy in college first and then go to the pros.
*  We watched this happen with Brandon Boston, who played at Sierra Canyon with him.
*  All of a sudden, he was on the Quippers.
*  I thought he was talented.
*  And they just let him go a couple of years later because he skipped a step that he shouldn't have skipped.
*  I will say, this is the last thing I'll say.
*  It's like I am really rooting for him though, seriously.
*  I'm rooting for him for a lot of reasons.
*  I'm never not rooting for him.
*  He's been around and on people's brains since he was in the sixth or seventh grade,
*  which how positive that is, how that must affect a kid.
*  I'm sure that can be great for a kid's psyche.
*  We're growing up in front of everyone and stuff.
*  But I desperately want him to succeed now and super duper hope that he succeeds
*  because not only do I want him to validate where he was picked,
*  but watching him, how emotional he was when he was selected, everything he's been through.
*  People say what they want to say about LeBron James.
*  He's an insanely dedicated father and family man.
*  So I do want him to work out.
*  I wanted to work out for him, but I've never been a fan of stepping over somebody who was
*  scrapping for it because of who your pops is.
*  I'm not going to start now.
