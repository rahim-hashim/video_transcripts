# Why Is Kevin Durant So Divisive as a Player? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0VBUccvEZM)
*  Durant passes Shaq. Durant is now the eighth leading scorer of all time.
*  Even though he missed most of 2014 because he hurt his foot or 2013
*  because he hurt his foot. He missed all the Achilles season between the Warriors and the Nets.
*  And he's probably, he's probably missed two and a half years because of injuries.
*  And he's just been 28, 29 a game now since 2009, 2010.
*  I think he's been probably the second most discussed player of the last 15 years behind Lebron.
*  Yeah. I am in the KD, I'm in the pro KD defender camp, but I also see the point some people make about it.
*  Why is there so much conversation with two sides with him specifically compared to some of the
*  other players in the league? What do you think it is? And you played against him for a bunch of years.
*  What is it about him? If we're going off of talent and scoring ability, there's no question, right?
*  Every player talks about it. Like, bro, this guy, the way he scores, he's number one in the NBA.
*  Number one. And he has been. His longevity as a scorer and Hooper is still not appreciated enough.
*  We praise Lebron every day as we should. We are even now talking about Steph and like Katie just
*  kind of swept under the rug. Meanwhile, the guys is averaging like 27 at age, whatever he is. He's
*  like in his high thirties, still putting up 30 and 40 point games. He's basically a 50,
*  he's a 50, 40, 90 guy for this decade. And that's insane. Yeah, it's insane.
*  And you know what's even more insane, Bill, is the degree of difficulty of shots that he shoots
*  consistently, contested, fadeaways, mid range. He's heavily a mid range player, pull up threes off the
*  dribble. He's the toughest shots in basketball and he's made them at a high clip. Every long
*  player that has decent skill when they come out like, oh, Kevin Durant. But we haven't seen one
*  yet. Even cut touch the surface of even being near him. Every lanky player we see in college or high
*  he has ability to be Kevin, bro, it's not happening. That guy is like a phenomenon.
*  Just how like we haven't seen like a guy before Lebron or after Lebron. We also haven't seen
*  anybody like Kevin. We haven't seen anybody at seven foot be able to move and shoot and have the
*  skill level like he has. So you ask this question, why isn't he regarded as such?
*  The Warriors thing just, it changes, it changed everything, Bill. And I'm not saying it's right
*  or wrong, but when you lose three, one to a team and then go to that team, and it's not only that
*  you went to the team, it's the fact that everybody knew how good you were at that time. You were the
*  second best player in the NBA as Lebron than you. When you go to that team, you made it.
*  I don't want to say he took the easy road, but it was the road that like
*  we knew him going to that team. I don't, cause it's soft to say it's not fair.
*  But this guy went to that team and he was still the best player in that team, by the way.
*  Steph was the most important to that Warriors team, but Kevin Durant is best part of the team.
*  Everybody saw that in the finals when they went against Lebron. The guy was incredible. It just
*  felt like, man, I just think you're too good for this. So, and we give him credit. He was still the
*  best part of the team, finals MVP, two-time champion. You got to give Kevin Durant his
*  flowers for that. It just felt like he was too good to do that. He was too good to do that.
*  And that's what like, even they gave Lebron shit for years when he went to Miami. You know what
*  I mean? It's just like the Cleveland championship meant way more. It's just like, bro, you went and
*  got that. You know what I mean? You went and did that. This one felt like, you know, it's like,
*  come on, man. Especially since you had enough, you had Russ there, you had everything there.
*  You were up three-one versus Golden State. It just, the timing of it wasn't right. And then,
*  you know, he's bounced around. He went to Brooklyn and it didn't work. And he goes to Phoenix and
*  we haven't seen him on his own just go get one. Where I've seen Steph do that. I've seen Steph
*  win after Katie left. He won before Katie was there. Stamped. You've seen Lebron win in every
*  single place he's been. Cleveland, Miami, Lakers, the guys won a championship. Stamped. Kevin's the
*  third guy in that tier, man. We talk about the best players of the last decade or more. It's
*  Lebron, Steph, and Katie. They're the three guys that are above everyone else. And two of them have
*  done it on their own or done it with their teams. Where Katie has simply only done it with the
*  Warriors. That's it. And we've had these weird years with Kevin where they lose early in the
*  playoffs. We saw that weird Boston series a couple years ago where Brown and Tatum really went at
*  him and we were like, what the hell is this? What's going on? Do you remember that? Yeah.
*  Yeah. I went to the games. Tatum outplayed him severely. That was like, whoa. That's weird.
*  I've never seen Kevin this vulnerable. I've never seen him play like that. So we have these
*  instances like that to where the media, obviously, they pick him apart. He's the guy that goes at
*  people on Twitter. He's a guy that's very emotional. They caught him with the burner. He's talking to
*  people. He always has comebacks. He has something to say. He is a very emotional guy. So people like
*  throwing stones at his glass house. And that's the difference between, think about it, man.
*  Steph is so regarded and self-respected and well-respected and he's professional and he stays
*  out the media in that lane. And his media is run like, I don't even think he controls his Instagram.
*  Clearly, it's somebody else. You could tell by the pictures that are posted. He's not even
*  involved in that. He plays. He does his thing. He's built his legacy. He's been on one team his
*  entire career. That's a whole different thing. You can't say anything to Steph. LeBron's LeBron.
*  So we're not even going to get into that. So Kevin has these things. They're like these little points
*  that I just named. I named like 10 of them. You can throw a stone at and break that glass house
*  till people feel like he's this or that. And because of that, it gets in the way of how
*  great he is. Because I'm with you, Bill. People thought I was crazy for saying Kevin Durant's a
*  top 10 player. I said this the other day. I was like, for me, man, I know it's hard to compare
*  guys in the 90s and 80s, but based off of scoring and skill, and I've never seen anybody like it,
*  Kevin's a top 10, top 15 player of all time for me, man. The guy in any era just dominates.
*  He is a scoring machine. I've always been a big Kevin Durant fan, so I am biased. I love watching
*  him play, and I just think he's unbelievable as a basketball player. I played pickup with him last
*  year. I mean, last summer, this past summer, before I decided to go and do the media stuff.
*  I played pickup with him like every other day. And the games were incredible, Bill. I mean,
*  we were out in the Valley. It was Devin, myself, Trae Young, Chet Holmgren. I'm talking about it
*  was filled with pros. Jalen Green. It was the invite only, and it was Kevin's pickup.
*  Kevin sent the text out. It was only 12 to 13 guys. If you weren't on the list, he didn't play that
*  day. And it was his pickup. So everybody wanted to play because it was Kevin. When I tell you he was
*  so much better than everybody else in the gym, it was laughable, man. He scored like the first
*  nine points of pickup. I remember at one point, he hit a tough fade away off the glass, going to his
*  left. And I look over and you could see like other gyms and coaches just like,
*  God, Lee, man, he's so gifted. He's so good. And we don't appreciate Kevin enough because of these
*  other things, man. And I wish if he went to championship, like with Phoenix or somebody,
*  like it would help so much. And I don't think it's going to happen because I don't think
*  Phoenix is good enough. That's the issue there. He has these things, Bill. He has these, he has
*  these little chinks in the armor that like we've seen LeBron and Steph not half. And like that's
*  the difference where like people, I think unfairly sometimes are so off of Kevin. That's one thing,
*  like you have some bones to pick with some of his decisions he's made, whatever, whatever. You don't
*  like you go into Golden State, okay, fine. But it's the difference to be like, man, Kevin, he's not
*  even a, Kevin's not, now we're whiling. Now we're doing too much. You guys need to take a step back
*  and really watch and look at his numbers and his portfolio and then come back and talk to me.
*  Cause the guy is unbelievable. I don't know. That's my opinion. I still defend the Golden State thing.
*  Yeah. I thought at the time I, I don't know if, I don't know if I would have done it,
*  but I understood it cause he had been there nine years with Seattle and then eight years in OKC.
*  He probably had enough of the Westbrook experience. The team itself, I think for years
*  and years they did the hard end trade. Like they didn't spend enough money. I mean, I've talked
*  about this so many times on this podcast, but I, I at least understood it. He wanted a life change.
*  He wanted to live in the Bay. He wanted to play in this awesome team. And I think he thought of it,
*  like, I'll go here for three years and four years and then I'll figure out the next thing.
*  And until he got hurt, it worked. I mean, they were going to win three titles in a row.
*  He was playing the best he'd ever played when he got hurt. He had that, that Quipper series.
*  We own that 2019 Quippers team. No, no, I think you were gone at that point. He was so awesome in
*  that. Like I really felt like that was the best he'd ever played. Oh my God. Yeah. That was that.
*  You're right. He was having like 50 every game on like, yeah. And the Achilles thing with, to me,
*  the Achilles piece is the part that gets forgotten. You know, if LeBron had just gotten hurt in 2012
*  and missed a year and a half, like we would have mentioned that a couple of times,
*  but that's one. And then I'll never understand the Brooklyn thing.
*  And maybe the Knicks weren't in the place where any player would have taken their organization
*  seriously and wanted to go there. But he had his main person, Rich Klyman, who they did a podcast
*  recently and Rich was like, I was trying to get you to go to the Knicks and Katie's like, yeah,
*  that was a mistake. I should have listened to you for him not to understand how relevant Brooklyn
*  is in the New York market compared to the Knicks. It's way worse than the Quippers. It is. The
*  Quippers have been here in the eighties and nineties. Brooklyn's like, they're completely
*  meaningless in New York. You know, for him not to get that, I just thought was a weird move.
*  You know, you talk about not having an identity, you know, Brooklyn.
*  They're number one.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it was, you know what that was, Bill? That was, he won two with Golden State,
*  remember? And then the Draymond, the Draymond thing happened, right?
*  That started it. All right. And after those words were said, sometimes even when you forgive each
*  other, you don't forget. He said those words to them on the court. I don't know what exactly was
*  said. I heard what it was said. I don't want to speak on it because, you know, whatever.
*  He said some things to, to, to Katie and that, that, that changed the way Katie looked at,
*  I think his place there. And I think he felt like, wait, wait, wait. And Isaiah Thomas's point the
*  other day, I think Katie felt like, hold on, wait guys, I know I came to y'all's team. I know y'all
*  won one before me. Let's not act like I didn't, I didn't make this go longer. Let's not act like I
*  didn't make us unbeatable. I, I, Kevin made that team that special. They were beatable. They just,
*  Isaiah, I went to that game and I watched the whole thing happen and I knew it was like,
*  Oh my God, this is bad. Then it got bad in the locker room too. And they, they never recovered
*  from it. But I think a lot of that had to do with Katie. He'd never really committed to whether he
*  was going to stay after that year. And it was just this festering, weird kind of situate. It's like
*  when your parents aren't getting along, but you don't, they're not, nobody's saying anything.
*  And then it just blows up at Thanksgiving one night. The game was like the Thanksgiving,
*  it was like, wait, what's happening? Mom just threw a turkey at dad. And they, and they had won two.
*  So at that point he got his rings. He wanted, at that point, I think for him, he was like, you know
*  what? Fuck it. I'm going to go play with my boy Kyrie and James. I'm just going to go play with
*  my homies and let's go see, we're going to win. We're going to have fun. It wasn't even a logical
*  decision. I think he was just in his mind. Like I'm going to go play my friends. I'm going to do it
*  my way. I'm going to do it this way. You know, cause he just wanted, he got his rings. That was
*  like his thing. He got my rings. I did this. I was finalist MVP. People can say what they want.
*  I'm going to go play my boy. Yeah. I beat LeBron head to head two straight years, which now he
*  gets some credit for that. He doesn't get credit for that. The only reason he doesn't get credit
*  for that is because to tell LeBron, LeBron was out there by himself playing against them and Katie
*  had too much help. So it's like LeBron was out there the second year by himself, but not the first
*  year. No, no, no, no. The first year, the teams from a salary standpoint were even. He had Kyrie,
*  he had Kevin Love, who they gave the first pick of the draft for. They had a bunch of expensive
*  role players. Yep. You know, I think it was close. I mean, when we went into that 2017 finals, people
*  were like, who's going to win? I don't think people were like the one who's going to roll them. Yeah.
*  I'll give you that. I'll give you that. The first one is definitely closer. The second one was
*  ridiculous. I mean, LeBron's team was like- Is that the best team, the 17? Is that the best team you've
*  ever played? 17 Warriors? No, you had to play perfect to beat them. It felt like you had to
*  play perfect. It felt like when you beat them, you're like, damn, we played great tonight.
*  Like you had to play great to beat them, especially in the third quarter. You could be up by 15 points,
*  man, going into halftime. And everybody felt like it was zero, zero because we all knew it was coming.
*  They were going to go on a run, especially back when they were at Oracle. That gym used to be,
*  it'd be rocking in there, man. It was just different. You would be up 20, you're like,
*  yo guys, we got to prepare ourselves for this run. We know they're going to turn that switch.
*  They're a third quarter team, probably the best ever. And they're going to go on a monumental run.
*  And it just felt like you couldn't slow them down once that gear got going, man. They had too much.
*  Steph was in his prime. KD was at the peak of his prime. Clay was in his prime. Dreymon had his
*  niche. They had good role players around them. It was nuts, bro. Our teams got close. I was on
*  that Houston, those Houston teams, man. We were really good. We just weren't good enough.
*  That was frustrating. I was even on the Clippers team before that, that tried to compete with the
*  Warriors. We were really good. We were just right there. We just weren't good enough. And they were
*  that's the best team I've ever played against in my life. I've never played against a team better than
*  them.
