# Is OKC the New Title Favorite? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MfUItMRZGw)
*  They're not like this crazy passing team where they're going to wow you with their ball movement.
*  We all know Shea like Shea is just a one of a kind, herky jerky gets wherever he wants to go.
*  No one can like find him.
*  He's impossible to guard.
*  No one can no one can get a hold of him.
*  I just think more than anything else.
*  Two things are beginning to make this the number one team for me.
*  Shea, Jalen Williams, Wing good Jalen Williams and not to deal with not good.
*  We call him J-dub.
*  J-dub.
*  J-dub is how we talk about him.
*  Okay, Shea, J-dub and Shet Holmgren already like look like a traditional big three.
*  Just the way they complement each other and how good they all are.
*  That's like come together.
*  It's a real foundational three guys that we know are going to be in our lives for a long time.
*  Number one ball handler all around big man wing in between them.
*  It's perfect.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Then you have sort of the interesting like how do they fit all the pieces around them?
*  I mean Dort is Dort.
*  He does what he does the giddy thing.
*  We've seen now two games and always made a lot of threes when people don't guard him like poor Zingas didn't guard him last night.
*  He made four threes.
*  That was the game plan last night.
*  Hey, Josh, go ahead.
*  Knock yourself out.
*  Wolves the game before same thing.
*  He made four threes, but more than anything else.
*  What's so interesting about this team to me is like, you know, the history of the league better than anyone.
*  This is not a thing that happens like teams this young do not get this good ever and the teams that have been this young and this good like the Oklahoma City Thunder team of 10 years ago with Durant and Hardin and Westbrook get their at least in that case on the back of like incredible young athleticism and not that they didn't have basketball talent IQ.
*  They did.
*  But like Durant is the seven foot unicorn.
*  And then Serge Ibaka is jumping out of the gym.
*  Russ is like a locomotive, et cetera, et cetera.
*  They just overwhelmed teams with force and speed.
*  This team has some of that like Chet is big and mobile and Jalen Williams is a tank.
*  J Dub is like a tank with these step back jumpers at the end of games, but they play with like a calm and a maturity and a lack of mistakes.
*  That is like I just don't ever remember a young team.
*  Like if you just looked at them from like on a blurry non HD TV from 15 years ago where you couldn't see their faces and how young they looked, you'd be like, man, this team, this team has been through the wars like they don't have to turn the ball over.
*  They make the right pass every time they make the right read in space.
*  Like they just don't play like a team that's their age and they are I mean, you've been on the bandwagon all year before the season credit to you.
*  Like I didn't think they'd make this big of a leap.
*  And you've also been on the they're ready to win now.
*  Like they can make a trade and be a championship contender.
*  Like they're a contender right now.
*  It's it's I watch them and it's part enjoyment and part like what the hell am I watching?
*  This is not supposed to happen.
*  There were some historical signs this could happen because they had and that was part of my case before the season why I thought they could be a top three seed because they were hitting these little checkpoints even last year going 40 and 42 without chat.
*  It's like, all right, let's add chat what Jalen Williams did in the in the last two months of the year.
*  And if she can go up a tiny bit of a level.
*  And the conference is kind of funky 50 wins.
*  I really believed in it.
*  I think the part that I didn't that I underestimated was the shape part because it's just happened too many times now.
*  I went on terminating Eddie's show yesterday and I was saying to me, we always are around the phrase top five guy.
*  But at some point you really have to like name your top five and to me he's bumped out Tatum at this point.
*  And I just think he's one of the five best guys in the league over and over again.
*  He's either beating the other best guy in the team or he's matching them.
*  But he's never getting beaten by those guys when it turns into a mono mono thing yesterday.
*  What was so interesting there there were three possessions where they won the game.
*  They're all in offense.
*  The Celtics offense was actually pretty good down the stretch.
*  To shade chat little pick and pops where chat hit a three and poor Zing is didn't come out in time.
*  And then the third one was they got they wanted to get shade on a switch on Derek White,
*  which is nuts because Derek White is great, but they want to get him off Tatum and Jaylen Williams was on Tatum with the ball.
*  He's like, fuck it.
*  And just just went by him and scored in the last minute.
*  The most important thing when he did that, I was like, oh, you guys are ready like now.
*  So I don't I guess the question is what's the trade.
*  By the way, I had them number one, two and not not recently by and state.
*  They've been the team I've watched the most this year than the Celtics.
*  I enjoy watching them the most.
*  They passed Denver for me because Denver is just so clearly in a we won the title last year.
*  We're going to be fine.
*  Don't worry about us.
*  We'll see in April and OKC night after night has been the star of the league.
*  Well, and people know us both of us like for a team to pass you could just team in the league pass rankings is very, very hard to do.
*  And I'm glad you brought up those SGA chat pick and pops at the end of the game because that's the kind of maturity I'm talking about.
*  Like as soon as they move poor Zingas from Giddy to chat, they pivoted right.
*  It like they didn't waste one position like, OK, now we got the big guy on chat.
*  Let's go pick and pop and see if KB can get out there like right away was really they're just they're well Mark Dagnall too, man.
*  They're well coached.
*  Dagnall might have a case for best coach in the league now.
*  Because I was feeling that way their best coach in the league.
*  I'm just saying he has a case.
*  I'm not saying I'm ready to call him the best coach in the league, but I started thinking about it last year when they had no big guys at all and they were always in these games.
*  And I remember seeing them in person against the Lakers.
*  I've talked about this the LeBron scoring record night.
*  I was there too.
*  And there was that long, long break.
*  And most of the time you see situations like that and the other team is just like, man, this is such an honor to be here.
*  LeBron is incredible.
*  They were pissed.
*  They wanted the game to keep going.
*  They ended up winning the game.
*  They Presti clearly has figured out some sort of secret sauce that, you know, smartly unlike Darrell when Darrell had figured out some inefficiencies in the late 2000s.
*  He's like, I'm going to give a long interview to Michael Lewis and talk about all the things I'm doing.
*  And the league was like, wait, what are you doing?
*  And they stole like nine of the things.
*  Presti.
*  My guess is he looks at length and competitiveness.
*  I think I think he specifically targets certain guys that just are wired differently.
*  And Kason Wallace is like that too.
*  That guy, he comes in what?
*  17, 18 minutes a game.
*  He'll guard the best guy on the other team.
*  He hits threes.
*  He plays under control and he's really competitive and over, you know, they'll miss with the occasional Poku.
*  But even Poku makes sense for what that Presti model is because long, gangly, weird guy.
*  But he's kind of maybe something.
*  So they rolled the dice with them.
*  But don't you think is there anything else?
*  Competitiveness and length.
*  But and also IQ recently, the last few years, he's been looking for guys who can really make the next play in open space.
*  And Poku is the kind of swing you can take when you have more swings than anybody else.
*  You can afford Sarah, this guy's just like a weird seven, whatever, whatever he is and take a shot at him.
*  But that's so weird why they didn't take Shangoon.
*  I'm still stunned that they didn't take that.
*  You'll never get over that.
*  Eight teams in a row passed him up.
*  We were doing we did the post draft preview and we were like, oh my God, like, how does he go 16?
*  But he just felt like a classic OKC guy.
*  So I do think that OKC number one.
*  I do think they need one more big body.
*  And they have to decide those those role guys they have who all play like 13 minutes a game or they're better off cashing in and getting somebody who could play like a legitimate 22 to 25 who's got real experience.
*  I think they're in a dangerous spot because you almost don't want to mess with this.
*  This team plays so well together and they all have shades personality.
*  That's another thing that's I think part of his MVP case has to be the team has taken on what his personality is, which I think is part of.
*  Yeah, that's what happened with the Oak edge the last couple of years.
*  That that team is unselfish like Oak edge.
*  Shea the team is like calm and in control and they play really hard and that guy.
*  Can you name five things about Shea?
*  I think he's the most unlikely NBA superstar we've had in 15 years.
*  I don't know anything about the dude.
*  He doesn't really do interviews.
*  He's not a big social media guy.
*  He's just a typical with all these other dudes.
*  You feel like you have so much knowledge of every piece about them.
*  He's just like this mystery dude that just comes in and takes out all the other guys like think about Tatum.
*  We know like what Tatum's kid looks like we watch him shoot game shoot shots before games Tatum's and all these commercials.
*  I'm sure Shea would do commercials, but he's just he's the most mysterious star.
*  We've had a long time.
*  Well, and there have to be I have not done it whether here or in Oklahoma City or anywhere, but there have to have been national writers in addition to local writers who have put out the
*  ask of like hey, I'd love to do a 20-minute sit down with Shea or like do a big thing on Shea and Shea's background and like what's this guy like and just like I unless I've missed it like that just doesn't care.
*  Like that's either either no one's asking or the Thunder and or Shea are saying no and like we just don't see that piece ever like I'm yeah.
*  Well, I don't know much about him.
*  One of my big regrets just as you know, I love being right in love predicting things ahead of time.
*  I watched shape for that whole year.
*  I never saw this.
*  I knew he was good.
*  We all knew like this guy's good.
*  This guy can be a starting guard on a championship team.
*  There's he has he's really good defensively is really smart.
*  There's a lot of great stuff here.
*  I never saw 30 points a game and night after night just just just out playing the best guy in the other team.
*  Well, and you rack your brain like a game last night will make you do it is where you're having the conversation.
*  Like I was thinking to myself like who's who's the best guy to guard him and there is no best guy and it's a six nine guy basically the Celtics have like five of them.
*  Yeah, it didn't matter like like who is I don't even know like is it is it prime Kawhi is it what's left of prime?
*  I don't even know who it is.
*  But like you want to say like hey would Yanis be on on him be interesting but Yanis is like not guarded quick guards all that well compared to how he does other stuff and shaking get those guys in foul trouble too.
*  That's the other thing.
*  It's like oh cool.
*  You're going to put this guy and I'm just going to get a file on him.
*  I thought of something last night and an analogy that I never thought of watching him and as soon as I thought of it his entire game clicked into my brain.
*  You're not a hockey guy, but the way he plays is the first basketball player and it makes sense because he's Canadian right the way he moves and kind of rotates around and weights and picks his spot and then strikes and comes back.
*  It's like watching a great hockey forward.
*  Like if you watch like Connor McDavid on Edmonton, see that now I'm losing it because he was the guy everybody tanked for it.
*  Yeah, there was like a great tank year of you watch Gretzky or you watch any great hockey forward.
*  They're always like gliding around.
*  They never seem like they're moving full speed, but they have the speed and they're always kind of waiting to strike.
*  They're like almost like Panthers or Cougars like just in the wilderness just kind of waiting to make their move and the best hockey players.
*  They float around and then all of a sudden they're doing something and I was thinking about that last night.
*  Like if he doesn't get what he wants, he brings it back and it's like, oh, he's not all right.
*  He's going to read.
*  Oh, no, he's not resetting.
*  He's going to the basket or oh, he has the defender on yo-yo.
*  He's flying by him.
*  Oh, he pulled back step back three always and it's just like he's constantly moving.
*  He's not for you know, I don't I wouldn't consider him a heliocentric guy, but it's not like one of these they give him the ball and he's just like, all right.
*  And everything has to set for eight seconds as he decides what to do.
*  He's always in motion and I think that's what's so hard for him to guard or for people to guard him.
*  It's interesting you say that because I've been thinking about I'd like to go back and watch him from like two years ago when when this the breakout began.
*  Because to me watching him this year.
*  We all know that like his change of pace and herky jerky style like that's kind of his trademark.
*  Like you just can't get a hold of him.
*  I feel like this year he's been smarter about yeah, I'm really good at the herky jerky change of pace stuff.
*  But like sometimes it's better if I just go because I'm all right really really fast in a straight line and I feel like he's been smarter about leaning that way a little bit more in the right spots and just like oh my God, he just blew by this guy.
*  And like maybe it's time to dispense with the herky jerky every single time I just go and like I feel like he's better at that.
*  We've only gotten through one team.
*  I'm aware.
*  I have one last shape point for you.
*  We have to you know, we do those ringer top hundred rankings.
*  If you worked with us, you would hate it.
*  It would it would I can only imagine what your responses with his act.
*  We need your top hundred.
*  You just be like, oh my God, I'm dying.
*  I did it once it was murdering me.
*  Um, this is going to you.
*  This would be a spit take from you.
*  And I'm going to say this as somebody who thinks.
*  Stephen Curry is the ninth best player of all time.
*  I think I have a ninth.
*  I have him a spot ahead of Kobe.
*  He's one of my favorite athletes of all time, much less favorite basketball players.
*  I had shade bump him and take him out of my top five.
*  I gave shade the fifth spot and curry six and curry has the playoff experience.
*  2022 finals just happened.
*  He's an amazing player.
*  But if I'm just judging right now when I'm watching day after day, she's just a little more consistent than curry is.
*  And in April curry might jump him in my rankings again.
*  But from what I've watched these first 10 weeks, she is the best guard in the league.
*  And I don't even know if it's debatable.
*  Well, I know you don't count Luca as a guard.
*  Him and Yoke Hitch are there some different position.
*  I don't even throw over there.
*  But he I mean, I don't think the curry thing is a spit take curry.
*  Okay, good.
*  He was a long shooting slump until last night when the Warriors beat Orlando.
*  I think he had 36.
*  But you know, all star stuff came out.
*  And so we started picking tentative all star starting five.
*  Yeah, I don't I don't think there's really an argument that Steph should start over as SGA.
*  Now, Luca is listed as a guard.
*  I know you're personally offended by that.
*  And everyone on the panel has you stood next to him.
*  He's 240 pounds.
*  He's a big guy.
*  He's a guard.
*  I don't know how he counts.
*  But Luca and SGA were the choices for everybody.
*  And there wasn't there was no pushback about like, well, curry.
*  I mean, historically, Curry is Curry this year.
*  What this dude is doing is ridiculous.
*  Can I redo one last thing and then we get to take a break?
*  So we're not allowed to obviously wager on the NBA Awards because we have votes.
*  But it always is interesting to me when we get to early January how off some of the odds are.
*  So I'm fan to right now the clutch player of the year.
*  Who do you think is the favorite in the betting market right now for the stupid clutch player of the year award
*  that I don't even really fully understand?
*  Who would you pick the favorite?
*  The favorite right now on January 3rd clutch player of the year.
*  Tyrese Halliburton.
*  He's third at plus 650 for some reason.
*  Dame is first at plus 340 and then Shay is plus 340.
*  I thought Shay was going to be like minus 300.
*  Like I just like I don't know how you can be more clutch than him.
*  We've watched him make game winners.
*  We've watched him over and over again beat the best players in the league head to head.
*  Like I didn't I don't even know.
*  I guess I don't understand this award.
*  Well the first month of the season the Bucs had that stretch where like every win they had was a close win
*  and a bunch of big shots.
*  I think maybe that's still fresh in everybody's minds.
*  Yeah, it was stupid.
*  You
