# The Curry Vs. LeBron Matchup Is Gonna Be a Spectacle | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgFDEOH-WAo)
*  You know, once a year I expressed my disappointment in retrospect.
*  I didn't mind it at the time.
*  I was pro KD Golden to Golden state, but in retrospect, especially after watching
*  what's happened with Curry the last few years, I'm slightly bummed out that they,
*  that Katie and Curry were on the same team for those three years.
*  Cause I just wish it had been the Steph show the whole time.
*  And I think in 18, if no KD and they had done whatever with the salary and matched
*  up and just had been the Steph team versus the LeBron team and LeBron, that was
*  the tail end of his apex, right?
*  2018.
*  That was his last, like truly great dominant.
*  He could do it game after game kind of year.
*  And Curry technically should have been in his prime right around then.
*  And we could have just seen them collide like, like two great boxers, but you
*  know, Curry's team was better and, uh, we just, we kind of didn't totally get it.
*  When it happened in 2016, I think LeBron was at a slightly different point of his
*  career than Curry was.
*  So now we're getting in 2023.
*  Curry is somehow not only in his extended prime.
*  I said this to you last pod or two pods ago.
*  I think this is the best he's ever been.
*  As I just think he's has just complete command of everything now in a way that
*  maybe there were 90% pieces of it here or there, but what I'm watching now, I
*  just think it's the best he's ever been.
*  You can't say that about LeBron.
*  Um, so it's not fair.
*  It's not fair though, because he's 38.
*  He's 38 and he's been in the league 20 years.
*  He can, he can have a quarter.
*  So I think we're going to have moments in this series where it's like a fourth
*  quarter where LeBron rises to the occasion, like he did in Memphis game four.
*  Um, and Curry's feeling it and we can have it, but I don't know if LeBron can
*  do that game to game half to half the same way.
*  Do you?
*  Well, we haven't seen him have to do it, but I mean, other than three point
*  shooting, I loved him in this series.
*  I loved him picking his spots.
*  I loved in game two.
*  Memphis.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I left this series going.
*  This was really impressive.
*  Whereas there's a time he could have been a 30 point score this year and it still
*  speaks to how talented and how dominant he is at this age, but like he definitely
*  paces himself, which I'm never going to be critical of him because it's kind of
*  a necessity, but his, not that he doesn't understand the game as well as anybody,
*  but his, his, he, but him knowing exactly when to ramp it up and do exactly what
*  they needed again, I know the three point shooting wasn't good against Memphis,
*  but I had multiple moments in that series where I was like, look at what this
*  guy's doing right now.
*  And it's not just the block or a dunk here.
*  It's it's he has to be their best player and carry them and win a series.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was impressed.
*  You know what this is?
*  I thought I was really impressed with LeBron too, cause he kind of knew they
*  probably weren't winning game five and they had just played two nights before.
*  And you could see he was doing this tight rope dance of, do I use some chips in
*  this game or not decided really not to, but this Curry LeBron thing at this point,
*  it's like a hoop, a hoops IQ fucking summit.
*  I just think both of those guys, I always thought, I mean, I wrote a
*  column in 2000 summer 2014 about LeBron as a genius because he was such a great
*  athlete, it was like his, his hoops IQ part kind of got glossed over because he
*  was just so amazing to watch people kind of didn't understand.
*  Doug Collins, that year I spent with Doug Collins, we talked about all the time and
*  he would talk about all these little things he saw with LeBron that somebody
*  like me probably wouldn't have noticed.
*  Um, there's a genius with Curry too.
*  And it goes back to what we were talking about earlier, where that sense of like
*  not only the moment, but what his team needs, when to kind of really step on the
*  pedal, when to pull back in the game today, where it's like, oh shit, nobody has it.
*  I guess I have to shoot 38 shots.
*  I don't think Steph ever wants to go into a game shooting 30 plus shots.
*  I just don't.
*  I think his dream game is like 11 for 24.
*  Um, clay gets off 11 or 12 for 12, 13 for 24.
*  Something like that.
*  That sounds better.
*  Hey, let me add, this game, this is going to be like a checker, a chess match, not
*  a checkers match between these two guys.
*  Like trying to figure out, you know, where the weaknesses are basically.
*  Okay.
*  So what question are you asking about the Curry LeBron thing?
*  Cause I think I derailed you from actually getting to the point you want to make.
*  I think this is, it reminds me of Hagler Leonard in 87, where it would have been a
*  lot more awesome to have it in 81, but it's still going to be fucking awesome.
*  And I do think there's some legacy stuff on the line, a tiny bit here.
*  Is that a tiny bit?
*  I do.
*  I do.
*  Cause if, if the Warriors beat them again, right.
*  And now it's he's beaten them in 23 and 18 and 17 and 15.
*  Right.
*  You go toe to toe, you're four and one that that's not nothing.
*  That's going to come up.
*  There will be a first take segment where somebody shouts that flame coming out of
*  their eyeballs.
*  That's not really the best.
*  One and four gets staff.
*  I mean, that's gotta mean something guys.
*  It is.
*  It doesn't mean nothing.
*  It is interesting.
*  I like in these debates to pre-guess the excuses.
*  Yeah.
*  Well he had Durant and two of them.
*  Right.
*  I mean, okay, but at any point.
*  Look.
*  But LeBron, they did, they did trade everything for AD and then they did
*  trade even more to load their bench up.
*  Like this team is loaded up in a way that the Warriors didn't do.
*  They're, they're deep and they have options, but their third best player on any given
*  night is usually going to be worse than another team, a really, another really good
*  teams.
*  Third, I'm just pointing out, they spent what nine first round picks on this
*  roster, just to trade for guys on this roster.
*  10.
*  Here's what I want to pick.
*  If Curry were to, to beat LeBron in the second round, and I can't believe we get
*  this, I can't believe we get this in the second round.
*  That's why like the Lakers were flirting with the play and stuff.
*  I go, I don't care how you feel about the Lakers.
*  I don't want the LeBron thing to end now.
*  I want to see what's going to happen.
*  I want some big stakes, but I can't believe we're going to be this lucky.
