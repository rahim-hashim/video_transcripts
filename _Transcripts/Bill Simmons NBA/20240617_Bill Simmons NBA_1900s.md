# Should the Celtics Be a Little Nervous After Game 4? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmNppsHsXhQ)
*  Let's talk about the finals.
*  Um, did Dallas find something in game four or did Boston just suck or both?
*  I think they found human nature and Boston was terrible.
*  Um, but Milwaukee's others, I pointed out on my pod on Thursday scores three,
*  four and five combined, we're scoring 28, I think 0.7 points per game in games one,
*  two and three.
*  So the third leading scorer, fourth leading scorer, fifth leading scorer for Dallas.
*  So that was combined almost 20 points less than the third, fourth and fifth option for Boston.
*  They did a better job.
*  Uh, probably I think the lively thing is, and they've kind of given up on Gafford.
*  And I was just impressed with Dallas in the night where they showed a lot of
*  pride for a newer team.
*  But I just don't know that you can ever get past knowing deep down, you're going to
*  have multiple more chances to close out a series and the other team doesn't have
*  that luxury.
*  And I think that's what happens a lot.
*  Yay.
*  Cause I had heard from some people who are at the Dallas practice the day before
*  and they were like zombies, dead men walking.
*  And I was like, Oh, cause there's also ways that could go to where it's the end
*  of a series and the teams like, eh, fuck this.
*  But it's really hard to do that in the finals.
*  And it's really hard to give up on winning a title.
*  You know, you go into that one game of time mode, but I will say, so I'm going to,
*  I'm going to give you all my best game for Boston excuses.
*  Okay.
*  I love it.
*  God, let me give it.
*  Let me get a pen.
*  Yeah.
*  Get a pen.
*  Number one, you mentioned already got the game they needed.
*  They came there to do a job to win one of the two.
*  They just happened to win game three.
*  So there's one.
*  Number two, really good Dallas adjustments.
*  And I think they stumbled into something in the second half that they then, uh,
*  went deep on in game two, which was the Derek Lively piece of it.
*  There's an alarming Derek Lively, our Horford stat I'm going to give you
*  Derek, Derek Lively, second half, game three, 17 minutes, six points, 10 rebounds.
*  Derek Lively, first half game four, 15 minutes, six points, 10 rebounds.
*  Out of those 20 rebounds, 10 were offensive.
*  So that's just two halves.
*  You combine those together.
*  He was 12 and 20 with 10 offensive rebounds.
*  Here's Horford stats.
*  Game three, second half, 19 minutes, zero points, four rebounds.
*  Game four, first half, 15 minutes, zero points, three rebounds.
*  Now there's two pieces to that.
*  One is that I think Lively is actually a pretty special player.
*  I've watched him in person now five, six times.
*  This is like a really unusually good rookie that has completely vindicated
*  their decision to throw away a season when they had Luca Doncic on their team.
*  Throw away an attempt, a chance to get into the play-in and likely get smoked.
*  I just think.
*  I just think it needs to be framed.
*  We are getting about it last year though.
*  Yeah, but the whole reason they punted is because even if they got in, they knew
*  they were like, what's the point of this?
*  I get it.
*  But they also have one of the best three guys in the league.
*  And I just, I never liked punting on.
*  I have one of the best three guys in the league, but they did it.
*  It worked out.
*  Lively is really good.
*  And I think first two games, he was running around like a chicken with his head
*  cut off and I think the finals were too big for him and he looked terrible.
*  And he was bowling into people and he was just all over the place.
*  And in game three, something flipped.
*  He settled down.
*  The big picture thing, and this is excuse number two is the no porzingis thing.
*  You really felt in the fourth quarter of game three and then game four, because
*  the Seltzer didn't have enough size.
*  They were getting killed on the offensive glass, which really has not happened a
*  lot with this team with or without porzingis and it was alarming, right?
*  So it's, so you could say dead legs, Horford in game four.
*  That's another excuse, right?
*  He's 38 years old.
*  They played Wednesday night, really gritty, tough game.
*  Then they have to play two nights later and drew and Jalen were awful.
*  That's the worst true holiday game I've ever seen in person.
*  So throw that away.
*  They won 10 straight.
*  They were due for a stinker, right?
*  You went 10 in a row in the playoffs.
*  That's incredible.
*  They were due.
*  And then the last piece, the human nature thing you talked about, you weren't
*  expecting to win game three, even though you thought you could and you wanted to.
*  And I really thought the Seltzer were going to win.
*  Now it's game four.
*  Well, what happens if we win?
*  Oh, party.
*  Where's that going to be?
*  Everybody kind of moves into holy shit.
*  What if we win?
*  What's Friday night going to look like?
*  And I don't care whether you're working for the team, you're coaching for it.
*  You're playing for it.
*  It's this weird thing that comes in where it's like, I don't want to jinx
*  anything that's happening here, but what happens on Friday night if we win and you
*  start and now if you're the players, you're like, should we go?
*  Should we be in Dallas?
*  Should we go somewhere else?
*  The whole Celtics organization, like, well, where's the party going to be?
*  We have to have somewhere for women.
*  We've got to run out someplace.
*  And your mind just drifts a little bit.
*  Whereas you're Dallas and you're Luca and you just got punched in the face by
*  everybody in the national media for two days and they're in Rocky four log cabin
*  mode and the Celtics are just a little bit drifting towards, and then I think
*  you saw what happened.
*  So out of those excuses, what's your favorite?
*  The last one.
*  You could tell those first quarter, they were out rebounded.
*  They were minus 10 in the first quarter rebound.
*  Okay.
*  And the Horford point is an awesome point because I think it's real and it
*  shows up and he's asked to do so much even without presenting us in the regular
*  season, but to know how stretched out he is and all the different stuff that he's
*  trying to do.
*  And then when Tillman comes in, it's like this first guy in the entire real
*  rotation now for Dallas, where it's like, Oh my God, someone we can ignore.
*  And I think how's worth, excuse me.
*  I think Al is probably in that category a little bit in game four by design of
*  like, maybe, maybe we just, he's the guy we sag off of.
*  Remember how well Al shot it?
*  What's that?
*  They were closing on him really good.
*  Even when they were leaving, I thought Dallas, their defense, I just thought
*  they had played Boston enough times that it was like, Oh, the ball's swinging
*  this way.
*  There's Al just start charging at him now.
*  He's got that weird little three.
*  It takes them a second.
*  He's got that hitch and they were kind of on him, even when it felt like he was
*  open a couple of times, but it was not a great Al Horford game.
*  I also think if you're watching film of certain things that were going wrong in
*  game three before the big comeback, which again, it's so weird.
*  It's just the Celtics this season.
*  Like that's a perfect, and people thought I was kind of like ripping them after
*  game three in the open.
*  And it was just like, no, I'm just pointing out like why, like the rest of the
*  country, if they haven't been watching and you're watching the NBA finals, you
*  get to see why this dominant statistical team is always met with this confusion
*  and worry like, I don't know.
*  And then like the clutch stat, I saw it.
*  There was a ringer piece that I was reading where it was kind of like, Oh, for
*  all of you people at all this concern about the Celtics clutch stuff, it's like,
*  okay, but can you call yourself clutch when your net rating is as good as
*  theirs is, but they blew a 20 point lead and scored two points over eight fucking
*  minutes in game three of the NBA finals.
*  So now like they get credit for being clutch because they won the clutch game
*  when Luca fouls out at four 12.
*  So when I think about how bad certain things were, whether it was Lucas defense
*  on the perimeter in game two, the Jaylen dunk that he had, or Luca didn't do
*  anything in game three, where I remember watching that one the next day and saw
*  that clip, I was like, God damn, Luke, I'm like, you didn't even, you didn't even
*  pretend to move on this one or that secondary cut off the Tatum drive where.
*  A lot of that is just watching the ball and watching the guy and losing, losing
*  track of the guy that you're assigned to just running past you and drew making
*  some of those plays.
*  If you're good enough to be in the NBA and you're sitting in a film session,
*  watching some of that stuff and you're like, you screwed this up.
*  Like think how mad you would be.
*  And you pointed out the info that you were getting like, Oh, zombies.
*  And then they come out and play the best game ever and smoke the Celtics, hold
*  them to their lowest point total for a half of any half all season long.
*  And it kind of reminded me a bit of the Phoenix thing in that we probably assume.
*  A little too much about how willing guys are to mail it in the three, two, one
*  Cancun jokes all the time, because like Phoenix is perfect spot.
*  Like that profile of that team going, all right, we're down three, one, like
*  maybe this game four is going to get really ugly and they were actually
*  competitive in that game.
*  So I expect teams to compete unless there's a massive gap between the two teams.
*  Dallas, this Boston thing is a bad matchup for Dallas that will likely show itself
*  again here at some point, but I don't feel like I'm just so impressed with who
*  Dallas has been throughout the playoffs to beat.
*  Okay.
*  See to beat Minnesota that I would expect something like this bill.
*  I would expect some, some evidence of pride and a performance that I didn't
*  think they were going to beat him, anybody like that, but the game just got so ugly
*  and gets away from, I'm not sure what the stats of that game even mean.
*  Yeah.
*  Horford had an interesting quote after the game when they asked them about what
*  adjustments it was either what adjustments do you have to make or whatever?
*  And he's like, well, we didn't make any adjustments so far because we were
*  winning Dallas made adjustments.
*  And I thought the two key adjustments for Dallas, one was Exum.
*  I don't understand why he didn't play him in game three and kid was just
*  throwing, he played 11 guys in the first half.
*  He was throwing shit against well, but even in game three, Exum, that's
*  unbelievable.
*  11 guys in the finals and in finals game in your must win game of the year.
*  And you don't know, you don't have 10 guys you can pick from, but Exum came in
*  for three minutes.
*  He can handle the ball a little bit, which I think really helps them because
*  it's the team.
*  So Luca Kyrie dependent, he's really the only other guy in the team that can
*  like bring the ball up, maybe beat somebody off a dribble and drive and kick
*  or anything.
*  And then kid just bailed on him and played Tim Hardaway, who was absolutely
*  atrocious in game three.
*  Then he had, he had a big garbage time in game four, but I think they realized
*  like, oh shit, we should play Exum.
*  He's better defensively.
*  He can at least handle the ball a little bit.
*  And they're paid.
*  He makes his own bonus.
*  Yeah.
*  He can move, he can go.
*  And then the other thing was lively, which is clearly if the Celtics aren't
*  going to poor Zingas, lively is athleticism, his fire, his ability to crash
*  the boards are real problems for this Boston team.
*  So yeah, they beat him in one game, but I was talking to my dad.
*  I had, I had a brunch with my dad today and we were talking about, um, game three.
*  And it's like, all right, what if Luca doesn't fall out of that game?
*  Do we win?
*  Luca found out four minutes left in Dallas still almost win the game.
*  Right.
*  And, and it felt like Boston had this first two and a half, three quarters of,
*  oh, you think we don't have KP.
*  So we're going to roll over to it.
*  No, it's actually the opposite.
*  We're going to do this and we're fired up and Tatum was great in the first half.
*  Jalen was unbelievable in the second half.
*  And then they kind of held on down the stretch, but, um, it's a three, one
*  series that feels a tiny bit closer than that to me.
*  And with that said, I wouldn't be surprised if Boston beat them by 35 in game five.
*  Well, we don't see Boston.
*  I don't think that version of them in game four, if they blow the lead in game three,
*  I just think all games, right?
*  You're right.
*  Like all of it's connected and so you can't.
*  Now the Dallas frustration for me would have been peak like game two going, okay.
*  These three things happened.
*  They had their stale offensive moment late, they didn't make threes.
*  They were six or 30 at one point and they were up nine points.
*  And, um, I don't think many, maybe it was the vocal.
*  People, people seem, I was surprised how many people were like actually really
*  positive about Tatum's game in game two.
*  Maybe you and I were harsher because of stuff we were seeing live.
*  Cause I even went back and watched the fourth quarter.
*  I was like, God, I can't believe how many people like just felt like his playmaking
*  was so great.
*  I think people are defensive of him now that in a way that this is now more
*  often to a different conversation.
*  So you're either I am pro Tatum and think he's incredible or I am a Tatum
*  basher and there's no nuance anymore.
*  And I thought what we did a week ago had nuance.
*  We were just pointing out what we saw.
*  He did some really good things.
*  He also didn't look confident in a lot of ways offensively with the ball.
*  And that's what both of us saw.
*  We didn't like it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the part that I think is like, Oh no.
*  Like if you're the number one option, which he is, uh, like that's, that's not
*  great.
*  Like you're stuck, you're stuck.
*  And so whatever it doesn't, who cares?
*  We already, we already did all that stuff.
*  So the series probably should be two, two, but it feels like it's, would you say
*  two and a half to one and a half is the right spot for the series?
*  Maybe that's the better way to do it.
*  I like that more.
*  I don't think Boston should be tied in this series, but it feels like a two and
*  a half, one and a half.
*  Cause Dallas didn't even have a fourth quarter lead in the first three games.
*  So it's hard to say, Oh, the series should be tied, but it feels like they're
*  getting better and they're getting better and Boston's getting worse.
*  I guess over the last five quarters, at least is a valid concern.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a five quarter sample.
*  That's a convenient way of doing it.
*  But now we don't know what to make a poor Zingas cause I don't believe anybody
*  when it comes to basketball injuries.
*  I never believe.
*  So why was he suited up for game four?
*  Do you think?
*  I assume they, my baseline assumption and it's not even team specific anymore.
*  I just think everybody just fucks with everybody else now.
*  Cause I thought they should have suited him up in game three, even if he wasn't
*  playing, why not?
*  What's the downside?
*  So you're, you're removing Jordan Walsh from the active roster to put for it.
*  Like who cares?
*  Put them on there and put a uniform on them and make them think he might come out,
*  which I think is what they're trying to do in game four.
*  The other theory I heard was that.
*  Muzula felt like if they were up 10 with two minutes left, you put poor Zingas
*  out so he can get into the last game, which seems very trophy participation ish to me.
*  I don't know why.
*  I don't know why that'd be the reason.
*  So I think they were fucking with him.
*  I agree with you on that one.
*  But do we see him in game five is the big question in game five because they really
*  need him.
*  I don't think they can play Tillman again.
*  I think that, I think that worked in game three.
*  I think Dallas figured out why it worked and they solved it and now we can't see
*  him again and they need more size.
*  They need rim protection and rebounding for whatever those non-Horford minutes or
*  need to go small with Tatum, which I mean, my dad and I like had a serious conversation
*  about, would you throw Kada out there for three minutes?
*  And by the way, neither, neither of us thought it was nuts.
*  Did you like the Kada minutes?
*  I, there's certain matchups where I don't mind Kada.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I don't mind them.
*  You know, if you're putting them in space and people are going through their legs,
*  like, yeah, somebody's going to score on them.
*  But if we need rim protection rebounding, I kind of like them more than Luke Cornett.
*  Where are you right now?
*  Give me nervous.
*  I, I'm more nervous than most.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause Lucas, every one of these first halves has come out.
*  We've covered this in part one and it's just dropped huge points on them.
*  And he seemed, I thought in game four, again, Boston played terrible, but Luca is
*  just really comfortable getting to his spots now.
*  And if he's getting calls like at game four, I thought the refs were a little
*  more Dallas friendly, which was predicted, predictable and predicted.
*  Um, and I thought Boston got a job done a couple of calls.
*  They still would, they would have lost by 32 instead of 38.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I, you don't actually, you're not actually blaming the officials for game four.
*  I'm not.
*  I just thought you found a couple of calls you didn't like.
*  I didn't like a couple of the calls.
*  I thought we could have lost by 32.
*  Grab some rebounds, make your layups.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  So here's, here's the number one thing that makes me feel good about game five.
*  I love drew holiday.
*  I don't think he can play worse than he played in game four.
*  And he's my number one candidate to be awesome in game five.
*  I don't see him playing two shit games in a row.
*  And I think he's going to be at a whole other crazy level because he just was
*  one of the, he had like a butterfingers game.
*  He just couldn't make layups, couldn't make little floaters was dropping
*  passes that were going out of bounds.
*  Even his defense was, was a little off and I just think he's going to be better.
*  And then Jaylen Jaylen had a weird game.
*  He had a, like a 2022 Jaylen game.
*  He didn't have the same.
*  That he was forced in a tiny bit in the first half.
*  I just think they're going to be a little more locked in, but KP is the big thing to me.
*  I think they need 12 minutes from KP and game five question for you.
*  Yeah.
*  I have not missed a minute of the Stanley cup final.
*  I was really looking forward to this one.
*  Was not thrilled when the Panthers were up three Oh on my oilers.
*  And it's fun just being a, just an idiot who doesn't really know what he's
*  watching and just enjoying the game.
*  Yeah.
*  Not thinking about it.
*  Anything I'm going to say, cause I don't really have anything worth saying.
*  Like kind of David's legacy.
*  Yeah.
*  But I also like notice that I'm guilty of what say LeBron does to viewership.
*  Right.
*  When you look at the finals ratings and you go, how did we go from 17 million
*  people watching the last version of the warriors and calves?
*  I think that was, I don't know if that was the average number of it was the
*  peak number of the peak numbers, even more than that.
*  And then you think of like what the ratings are now, or I can't figure out
*  like, is it really that much lower?
*  Just six years later and you go, okay, the LeBron factors that big of deal.
*  And here I am with the McDavid factor.
*  Someone call it the dry side of factor.
*  Cause I'm a huge dry side of guy.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  Right.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  His just his vision.
*  It's Reed Shepard ish.
*  It's also amazing defensively too.
*  He's just ridiculous.
*  Right.
*  But he has, he's been a disappearing act for games.
*  And I don't think Skinner, uh, most of the goals are like Edmonton
*  looks like the better team.
*  They make a huge mistake and then it leads to a goal.
*  So I didn't really think it was on Skinner.
*  So the reason I set this whole thing up also, because if you had told me 20
*  years ago, there's going to be a moment where the Red Sox and Yankees are in
*  town while you're in town and you're going to stay home and watch the Stanley
*  cup final instead of Red Sox Yankees.
*  I would have never believed that was a scenario that would ever happen.
*  But that's, that's what happens when you trade Mookie Betts for a
*  below average starting catcher.
*  I, I cannot believe where I'm at right now with the Boston Red Sox.
*  I'm actually, I felt guilty about it.
*  I go, you're not even going to throw on Sox Yankees.
*  When, but when Henry did the whole, this team's an asset and we don't
*  sell our assets, whatever that was, I mean, that was, I felt vindicated for,
*  by the way, I still have not watched an inning of baseball, even though I'm
*  following what's going on of the Red Sox this year, because I'm not supporting
*  these guys.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  So big lead up.
*  Not, not unknown for me.
*  Oilers dominating game four, much like the Mavs dominate in game four.
*  Would it be worth it just for you to be alive for something as historic to have
*  both the Oilers and Mavs come back down three-oh it's happened in hockey before.
*  It's never happened in basketball.
*  I know it'd be disappointing as a Celtics fan, but as a chronicler of
*  historic moments in sports, would you be okay with it?
*  I would not.
*  The answer is no.
*  I think it's more realistic in hockey though.
*  Basketball, I think unrealistic hockey, just so random and stupid.
*  And we've, there's been so many playoff series.
*  It's one of the reasons I lost a little interest in hockey over the air.
*  Cause sometimes you feel like that, that's how the series just ended.
*  We were in double overtime and we've never talked about this.
*  Did a wrist shot and it bounced off two guys shoulders.
*  I was going to all those Kings games in 2014.
*  It was unbelievable that they, they won all those rounds in a row with some of
*  the 2012, they're the best team 2014.
*  They needed a lot of luck.
*  I felt that way about the 2013 Bruins too.
*  Hockey is just, just rips your soul out.
*  I think it's the most aggressive ending of anything in sports other
*  than like cock fighting, because you think you're in control.
*  You've got the puck, you've controlled it in your offensive zone.
*  They haven't had a sniff of their side of the ice and just stupid
*  goal coming, you could feel it.
*  It just ricochets off some guy's skate whose head is turned.
*  Right.
*  Then it goes in and then you're not even aware of it.
*  And then you're at home and you're just like, your heart is
*  completely ripped out of you.
*  And that's why I actually think it's less likely in hockey because of the
*  randomness that there's no way that every break is going to go Edmonton's
*  way four games in a row, right?
*  Whereas Dallas, you know, maybe unlock some things, maybe Lucas grown up,
*  maybe Kyrie second time around in Boston understands what's going on.
*  Why is there Kyrie?
*  I just think it'd be too hard for the Celtics not to have at least one more
*  awesome three point shooting game.
*  Like if you're going to really say, is this conceivable that
*  they could blow a three lead?
*  They just retire.
*  No.
*  What would you do though?
*  I mean, cause that would, that would be a tough one for you.
*  I genuinely be worried about my dad's health because my dad might be too old
*  for one of those moments, us sitting.
*  I was worried about him in the Miami game seven and that wasn't even the finals.
*  But you know, I, it is scary when you watch how easily Lucas scored a game
*  four, you just kind of helpless, right?
*  Which is why they need poor Zingas.
*  Cause you put poor Zingas in at least for six minutes a half.
*  Somebody's around the room with his hands up that you have to think about.
*  And they didn't have, once the guys weren't rebounding or protecting the
*  rim in the right ways, it became super easy for Dallas.
*  Derek Lively.
*  I love Derek Lively.
*  I'm really impressed by him.
*  He's not that good.
*  He's not 20 rebounds in two quarters.
*  Like he's 20 years old.
*  He shouldn't be doing that to them.
*  So what I liked about it from Dallas too, was like everybody was getting involved
*  and everybody's kind of like having to fuck these guys kind of game.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's true, but there's a lot of good history.
*  The other way of these blowouts that ultimately mean nothing.
*  I mean, the probably the best one was two years ago in Memphis.
*  Remember they beat Golden state by like 50, 55.
*  So it was some, it was just an ad and it was like, Oh my God, is Golden state done?
*  I remember being on text threads.
*  Like, is that it?
*  Did they just kind of end the Golden state run and then Golden state ends up
*  winning the title anyway.
*  So there's been a few of these over the years.
*  And I remember even my favorite team ever.
*  And I'm so delighted.
*  I get to bring them into the podcast.
*  The 86 Celtics game five, Houston, seeching Samson fight.
*  Jim Peterson comes in wreaks havoc and the Celtics blow game five when it seemed
*  like they had the title wrapped up.
*  They come back game six and blow them out.
*  I think the thing, the thing to remember about Dallas is those world guys on the
*  road.
*  If it gets super hot around the collar, I don't know how many of those guys I trust.
*  Like, do you trust those Derek Jones threes when they're in Boston?
*  Do you trust Exum who's going to play more in game five, just being left alone.
*  Hey Dante, knock yourself the fuck out from 24 with the crowd going nuts in like a
*  second half of a must win game.
*  There's, there's ways that they can shift pressure to some of these non Kyrie Luca
*  guys that I think could work for Boston.
*  And I asked, so like, I think they're the, I think Tatum's going to be better.
*  Jalen's been so good, the whole playoffs.
*  Is he really going to play two shit games around?
*  So I think they're going to show up tomorrow in a big way.
*  Golden state loss.
*  See what happens with Luca 39.
*  That was one 34 95, but they were already up three one in the series.
*  Maybe it's because the warriors and the three one jokes and whatever, but then
*  they, they came back and close it out.
*  That was a, that was a series where I, I broke Murnau's heart because I'd
*  enjoyed the Memphis thing.
*  The Memphis thing is a real thing.
*  Whatever it is, it's just different.
*  It feels different.
*  You know, you're watching a game in Memphis and I want that back.
*  I want that back for that fan base.
*  Yeah.
*  The way those guys chirped and kind of, it was like, you guys need a little bit
*  more of a resume, I think to be acting like that, but maybe that's just the
*  Memphis experience where I was like, I am, and everybody knows that I love staff.
*  So it wasn't like I've had a lot of opportunities where I've been rooting
*  against him in his entire career, but that was a game six where I think I'd
*  said at the pod, I was like, I hope they destroy them because of the way Memphis
*  had acted in, in that, in that whole game.
*  Yeah.
*  Wait, before we take a break, you never told me what you think is going to
*  happen in game five of the 2024 NBA finals.
*  I don't know why, like I'm kind of waiting for the next stretch of threes
*  that we saw in game one, I'm kind of just waiting for it and I imagine it's
*  probably happening in game five, but I think Lucas horrifying man.
*  And that's, it's kind of funny.
*  Cause if you think at the start of part one of the pod today and here we are,
*  it just, I know the issues I'm with you.
*  The things like we would all agree on the stuff you don't really like.
*  And it is kind of a reminder too, of how intently people are now watching
*  Luca for the first time, because you're like, Hey, look, I thought he complained
*  more against OKC in Minnesota than he has in the NBA finals.
*  And the don't, don't leave out the Cooper series.
*  That was in person.
*  So I felt like my, my observation of that was totally distorted.
*  Cause I saw it in person and in person it's even more.
*  We talked about it on the pod.
*  I went to that one game with Rob Stone and he's like, is Luca always like this?
*  It was like one of those.
*  He was just like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
*  The whole time.
*  Well, Rick Carlisle was on with, with Chris Long on his podcast and he said,
*  he's like, if Lucas not the best player in the world, I don't know who is.
*  I think there's probably another guy you could name.
*  Yeah.
*  Even if you want to pick Luca over Jokic, I don't think it should be
*  presented in a way where you're going, I don't even know who the second guy is.
*  But for all of the things about him that can be, and look, it's six months.
*  It's the roommate theory.
*  We're annoyed.
*  We're, we're annoyed with way more players right now than we're in love with them
*  because we've been watching them nonstop since October, but he is capable of
*  doing some pretty crazy shit.
*  And there's a lot of times in a game where you're just like, I don't know what to do.
*  I don't know what to do.
*  I don't know what to do.
*  Cause he's getting whatever he wants.
*  And the zag now off of game four was incredible defense by Luca.
*  That's the hardest I've seen him work on that end.
*  And it was like, eh, he tried harder.
*  There's no question, but true holiday missed like four, three footers.
*  Here's what happens when you don't play good defense and then you hold up in some
*  switch against somebody, cause you guess right to the dribble side.
*  And then they play the clip like four times throughout the broadcast going,
*  Oh man, like you only get to play three footers.
*  It's a new version of the hardened post defense recognition comment of every
*  playoff game.
*  It's like this guy's out of position, lazy, doesn't fucking care.
*  It doesn't adjust to personnel, but it'll get caught in a post and he holds up
*  because the guy misses the turnaround.
*  Really?
*  He's a great post defender.
*  Be like, yeah, cause that's the priority now.
*  Whenever I'm thinking about how to build a roster is who's a really good one on
*  one post defender because nobody does it anymore.
*  So it's like, yeah, he's a great post defender.
*  Because nobody does it anymore.
*  So the newer version of this is bad defensive reputation and then has a couple
*  possessions where he stays in front of a ball handler and it's like all is fixed
*  in the town rejoice.
*  Well, I'll tell you this as we head to break.
*  One of the many things I love about the finals and you've heard me say this many
*  times is this, the finals goes along.
*  You trust people less and less and less.
*  And usually you're down to seven guys, maybe by the end of this, my guess is
*  Dallas is going to now be rolling with PJ Jones, Gafford, Irving, Luca, lively
*  Exum and a whiff of Kleba and that's it.
*  The whiff of Kleba.
*  A whiff of Kleba.
*  Maybe Gafford starts the game, but he's out in like four minutes Celtics.
*  Kleba's defense is a positive too.
*  Yeah, no, I there's weird plus minus stats with him, even though he didn't do that
*  much that they were better in situations in the four and then for the Celts, the
*  starting five, obviously.
*  Hauser, poor Zingas and like half of Pritchard.
*  Cause if Pritchard sucks like he did in game, in game three and then the first
*  half of game four, I don't know if you can bring them back in a, in the second half.
*  It to me, Pritchard is on a half by half basis now, cause he just hasn't played well.
*  He's just, those are really tough minutes for them to survive defensively because
*  it just becomes Pritchard season.
*  And if you look for it and you'll see it in the first half, but I think that's, if
*  it's a tight game in game five, I'd imagine that's something that's not going to want
*  to, like, you're just going to have to extend the other guys.
*  But you know, but you know, Boston's, you know, they're going to have two adjustments.
*  I will say one other thing, and then we're going to go break with Dallas that, uh,
*  this is a weird point, but I think I might even said this after game three.
*  I thought Dallas spent so much time hunting for matchups with Luca.
*  You know, they would chew up 10 seconds of the shot clock being like, oh, we got it.
*  And then if this guy can come over and then Luca can have, and then by the time
*  they got what they wanted, especially if they walked it up, there's like seven
*  seconds left in the shot clock.
*  I thought in the fourth quarter of game three and then all game four, they pushed
*  faster.
*  And sometimes they were like, you know what?
*  Whoever's fucking guarding Luca, it doesn't matter.
*  He's just going to, he'll just take that guy.
*  They try, they try to switch matchups sometimes, but there are other times where
*  he was just like, all right, fine.
*  I'll just take Jason Tatum.
*  Fine.
*  I'll just take Jalen Brown.
*  So I thought they were moving at a faster pace that I thought really helped them.
*  And Exum really helps them with that.
*  Exum to me, if he plays like 28 minutes and hits a couple threes, that's a bad
*  sign for the Celtics, but I would say for Dallas, Lively and Exum are the guys to
*  watch and for the Celtics, the poor Zingas minutes.
*  And honestly, Drew, I think Drew could have an awesome game five because it feels
*  like finals MVP is still in play too, right?
*  Not that that would incentivize him in any way, but I, I could see a world where
*  Drew is the best player in game five.
*  Uh, I think Tatum's do.
*  Although look, his game three was, was terrific.
*  You know, I know that it was the Jalen Brown show in the second half, but Tatum
*  was so good in the first half was fantastic.
*  Right.
*  But Brown, whether it's the Derek White or to Drew three, or excuse me, the Drew
*  kicked at the Derek White three where Drew went baseline.
*  I thought that play was huge.
*  Do you want more game log from game three?
*  I'm going to stop now.
*  Drew 38 to one on Fandl Jalen's minus two 30 Tatum's plus two 20.
*  Luca is 14 to one.
