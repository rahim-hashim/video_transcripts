*  You look great. I the the the listeners can't hear it. Can't see it. But you got like a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=127.34s)]
*  A little bit of a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=133.38s)]
*  It's like an early 2000s Red Sox setup guy Fu Manchu kind of look is that a Van Dyke or a Fu Manchu? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=145.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I was looking at some old pictures of myself [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I usually break this out a couple times a year and I did it when I got my license [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=158.76s)]
*  picture last summer and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=163.0s)]
*  The picture of my license is just horrifying and so for whatever reason I don't know [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=165.12s)]
*  I just I used to do when I was in my 20s [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=170.46s)]
*  I usually do do it every now and then so we're we're back [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=173.48s)]
*  I love the board with your face moments, not just you but me. I have them too. We're just like, yeah, fuck it girl mustache [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=177.04s)]
*  Didn't you do it for PTI? I did we did we did mustache week me the levitard [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  We just both grew like big bushy like buddy cop mustaches. Yeah, it's fun lately [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=191.06s)]
*  I've been shaving a mat like that side that feels like a move now to be like [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=196.72s)]
*  I'm gonna shave like a couple times a week back with the shaving [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=200.2s)]
*  Honestly, if you went clean shaving you're just getting ahead of where this is all going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=204.32s)]
*  That's a couple years because there's gonna be a stretch like anything that's whether it's fashion or hairstyles [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=208.44s)]
*  I mean, this is not insightful. It's all cyclical [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=214.6s)]
*  But there's gonna be a stretch years from now where you're like what the hell was going on [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=217.16s)]
*  Everyone has had a beard like everybody just had a beer [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=222.12s)]
*  I remember being so early to the beard that I showed up to the National Championship game with it when it was Oregon [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=225.26s)]
*  Auburn and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=230.88s)]
*  Todd McShay and Jesse Palmer on the sideline being like you you didn't shave and I'm like I'm at a football game [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=232.42s)]
*  I'm not even on TV and they're like, yeah, but dude like you look terrible [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=238.94s)]
*  It is funny. So how many years ago is that like early 2010s range? Yeah [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  Cam was still in college. So it's like I think it's 15 years ago that came [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=248.34s)]
*  I remember between the first and second years when I was on the countdown show and I showed up for something during the summer [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  And I had a beard and everybody was like you're not gonna have that on TV, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  Like freaked out by it. It does feel like the beard the beard stuff is shifted [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  By the last and then kovat just it just was full bloom [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=267.18s)]
*  Covid was was kind of the apex mountain for beards. Everyone was just I don't care anymore [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that cranked it up. That was really the home run PED phase of beer [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=277.18s)]
*  We were like Luis Gonzalez is how many home runs? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=282.06s)]
*  Thousands yeah, cuz then it's a it's a bit like the arm sleeve thing like the early arm sleeve tack guy [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=286.62s)]
*  You're like, all right. I don't [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=292.9s)]
*  Probably don't want to mess with that guy, you know, it's like somebody has really friendly, but they blink a lot [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=294.94s)]
*  I just go I'm gonna stay away from him [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=298.9s)]
*  Oh, you need to start over blinking is is a fair thing for you a little bit [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=302.36s)]
*  Yes certain size a guy that blinks a lot want nothing to do with it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=307.38s)]
*  Never thought about that tip. No, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good tip for everybody. Yeah [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=312.46s)]
*  so anyway, I think the sleeve the sleeve thing turned into I [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=317.3s)]
*  Just felt like there should have been some prerequisite [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  Like you're gonna get double sleeves. I think you're getting arm sleeves [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  You know now I don't and so I think the beard was some kind of transition off of that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=328.02s)]
*  I likely will never be clean shaving like I cannot even remember the last time just full-up lather [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=332.24s)]
*  I don't even have shaving cream at my house [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=337.46s)]
*  I [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=340.5s)]
*  Would have a beard way more often, but mine just gets white and it actually it used to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=341.74s)]
*  Right used to hide some stuff. But now it's like you actually look younger when you don't have the beard [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=346.7s)]
*  There's been some weird phases since ever since I could shave [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=351.22s)]
*  I think sideburns were a really weird stretch in that 92 to 94 [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=354.7s)]
*  stage inspired by Brandon and Dylan and I don't to know and then all of a sudden people were [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=359.34s)]
*  Doing different sideburns things for like a year and a half. That was weird [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=364.42s)]
*  We was also the high flat top look was in for a little bit [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=369.18s)]
*  Like there's definitely been some weird stages looking back on what was going on there [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=373.66s)]
*  Well, the sideburns thing is again [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  Just the cycle of let me see how low I can bring these down and it was fine [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  And then everybody was like I get rid of these but I remember the first moment [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=384.3s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't even shave like who am I kidding? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=387.66s)]
*  But the first one guys in junior high for like travel basketball, you know [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  A couple early bloomers if you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, how's this guy doing? He's got a shaving kit and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=394.3s)]
*  Like this guy from Willam Manic like what's going on? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=399.98s)]
*  And so then dudes who couldn't even shave me being one of them you just felt left out [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  So guys started shaving their sideburns up as high as possible. Right? That was really I didn't like yeah [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=406.94000000000005s)]
*  I hope that never comes back. But yeah, there was also there was just a lot of chin shit in the early [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=412.74s)]
*  2000s out of boredom [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=419.7s)]
*  I feel like that was baseball related [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=421.7s)]
*  Because baseball really had that big comeback in the late 90s early 2000s steroids driven Yankees driven [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=423.86s)]
*  Yankees versus Red Sox bonds and the home run McGuire and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=431.86s)]
*  Then the relievers and the home run sluggers all started having weird facial thing and it just took off [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=435.54s)]
*  Remember don't try to Duncan had a year in the early 2000s when Duncan went with like the shaved head [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=442.74s)]
*  Got a little like your look right now, but it was like what are you doing? You're Tim Duncan. Why? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=449.5s)]
*  Why are you trying this? What are you trying to look like? He almost looked like Dennis Haysbert [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=453.86s)]
*  The white beard call is right though because now I'm at the point where if I let it go [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=458.46s)]
*  It's patchy in areas where it's not colored and then I have buddies that are dying their beards [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=465.06s)]
*  And then I all I can think about is Richard Kimball and I just think like I don't know man [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=469.86s)]
*  like I might I might want to like at this point I [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=474.54s)]
*  Don't know that you're necessarily hiding your age, but there are definitely dudes that when they go full beard now [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=478.54s)]
*  I'm really even though you've got this salt and pepper thing. You're going way more salt than pepper [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=483.82s)]
*  Yeah, and you've aged yourself [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=489.14000000000004s)]
*  So much so, you know, I don't I remember when cowherds contract was up [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=492.1s)]
*  I think he had red hair and I was well, he joined FS one. He went he went blonde for a bit [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=496.5s)]
*  I've never died or done anything. I just can't do it [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=502.3s)]
*  I'm just like if if nature is taking me certain directions, so be it [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=505.06s)]
*  It's the way it's gonna have to go. I had a really hard time having that ball patch in my head [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=509.3s)]
*  It was just brutal and yeah, the celebrity game really shook you though the high-camera shot [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=514.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if I see John Berry to this day it might be on [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=520.14s)]
*  Because my he mentioned it my buddies wanted to kill John Berry did he make a joke about it? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=525.42s)]
*  He talked about it the entire fourth quarter. Apparently I can't even go back and watch the tape. It's too traumatic [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=530.26s)]
*  Wow [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=534.98s)]
*  I wonder if it was just the YouTube's Oh, it's all over the place [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=536.26s)]
*  So my my friends I'm talking about it again in Massachusetts friends that aren't exactly the most supportive people. Yeah [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=539.58s)]
*  scholars have argued they don't even argue about it and so [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=546.5s)]
*  They were like hey, what the fuck is up with John Berry and I write I don't know [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=549.94s)]
*  Like I was done with the game [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=554.38s)]
*  You know [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=555.7s)]
*  like I'm [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=556.3000000000001s)]
*  Sitting here trying to ISO against Hunger Games and I get the secretary of education telling me to calm down a little bit and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=557.14s)]
*  I had a sub myself which games person [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  Was it a Josh or something oh that little the he was smaller right Josh [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=567.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I pushed him pretty hard at one point because I just wasn't playing well [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=571.9s)]
*  I'd actually had like a crack in my leg and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=575.62s)]
*  You know, whatever now I'm making excuses [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=579.06s)]
*  So were you the guy who tried to Josh Hutchinson? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=580.74s)]
*  Were you the guy who tried too hard in the celebrity game? Because in my game it was the actor Jesse Williams [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  Who just was going all out? I didn't play it as a Westbrook [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=588.9399999999999s)]
*  I didn't look I shouldn't I was not a celebrity [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=592.3s)]
*  You know ESPN was usually pretty good about trying to get somebody on air involved in some of that stuff [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=596.54s)]
*  I like so whatever was yeah, it was just [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=601.46s)]
*  Obviously, I'd want to do it [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=605.7s)]
*  But I clearly wish I had gotten a play [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=607.02s)]
*  Before that because then when I went back home to talk to buddies that I played was regular they're like you're terrible now [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=609.3s)]
*  Like we talked so much shit about like they were like look out [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=614.9s)]
*  He's gonna go off in this thing and I was like, yep [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=617.58s)]
*  I know but then on the other side it was a bit like when Kyrie was having his playoff run last year where [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=620.14s)]
*  Even if he went four for 20 people be like his joy is back and it's unbelievable [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=625.62s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=630.46s)]
*  So the threshold for like a good Kyrie stretch was pretty low and I think it was the same and so when I got back [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=630.9399999999999s)]
*  The ESPN people were like, oh you played really well. I was like, yeah [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=637.54s)]
*  You got called bald I guess for straight hours [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=641.38s)]
*  So that would be a good NBA award at the end of the year that we should vote on the joy is back award [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=643.86s)]
*  We have to vote whose joy was the most back [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=650.14s)]
*  Who's the joy of back winner this year next year like the odds on? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=653.38s)]
*  Fandals posting 26 odds and like KD is a minus 300 favorite for the joy is back [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=660.18s)]
*  He hasn't been traded yet right because you actually have to factor in the pre miserable [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=665.42s)]
*  Yeah, you can't just pick somebody who's happy all the time. You have to get somebody who's a really moody dude [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=669.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's tough. I don't know who our joy is back guy is [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=676.02s)]
*  I mean, you get wherever Durant ends up I think for next year [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=679.7399999999999s)]
*  It's probably off the board. Is it maybe it's Kyrie maybe Kyrie because the the trade was so late last year or the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=683.0999999999999s)]
*  Turn around was so late last year. Maybe he's [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=689.9799999999999s)]
*  Grandfathered in and he's the favorite this year. I don't know. You would have won it last year [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=692.7399999999999s)]
*  I think that could there be Kyrie joy is back voter fatigue because he would have won it last year [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=696.9s)]
*  But like a back-to-back Donovan Mitchell who I don't think was completely miserable last year [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=701.8199999999999s)]
*  But I do think has has like an added level of joy this year and I think he would be [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=706.9399999999999s)]
*  Somebody I would at least accept the thing Paul George probably be last in the voting [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=711.5s)]
*  He'd be the the joy is not back if that was an award [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  When I'm beat on the other team when they do the joy is back sit down for yeah. No, it's Jimmy Butler. Oh [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=720.38s)]
*  Perfect. Yeah, you can't even but there's like he had five points the other night when Steph had 56 [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=727.9s)]
*  So they interviewed him in the locker room and he was like just delighted [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=732.42s)]
*  He was saying I'm just so pleased to be here for this every Jimmy Butler quote [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=735.06s)]
*  I feel like did Aaron Sorkin write the perfect [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=739.9799999999999s)]
*  Like recovery like every quote. It's not just one good quote. They're like 12 for 12. They're all perfect [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=744.14s)]
*  right you think like hey Sorkin's come up with a script of [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=751.14s)]
*  this player that basically [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=755.14s)]
*  Sabotaged himself destroyed his own market value destroyed his own free agency [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=758.38s)]
*  Like this isn't new even if we could get into some of the debates [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=762.98s)]
*  Which I think there's some fair criticisms of some of the Miami stuff [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=765.9000000000001s)]
*  But I mean ultimately it was Butler that just checked out on the whole thing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=769.34s)]
*  They're like, okay [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=772.1s)]
*  But when he goes to this new team and everybody starts making threes and they win a bunch of games like give us perfect quotes [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=772.58s)]
*  Every quote Butler has for like two weeks has nailed it. It's one of those situations where you're like, oh, I forgot this guy had teeth [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  We hadn't seen his teeth for like three years because he had spoiled since like [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=786.4200000000001s)]
*  2021 [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=790.74s)]
*  So now there's Jimmy Butler's teeth. They're back [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=792.3000000000001s)]
*  Giving these perfect long monologue answers and if I was on the heat, I'd be so pissed [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=795.1s)]
*  Like oh my god, really was that he's happy [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=802.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're this happy Steph is like this much of a joy to be with apparently is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=805.4200000000001s)]
*  It seems that I mean that's another one is Steph is our joy MVP of just like he just [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=810.26s)]
*  Parcels out joy to other people is able to like transfer it to them [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=816.1800000000001s)]
*  Just all you have to do is play with them and then go when everybody this is what happens when you cut [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=819.36s)]
*  Yeah, like you cut and then all this stuff is just wide open. I mean still even at Steph's age with this so [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=825.24s)]
*  Butler it was funny because we had Anthony Slater on who you know from the athletic he's national [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=833.36s)]
*  But you know his background is the Warriors [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=838.1s)]
*  He made a really good point because I think anybody that knew about what was going on before the trade deadline and all the different conversations [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=840.28s)]
*  You hear like the Warriors are a little split [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=845.74s)]
*  Well, ultimately it matters if Lake up or done leaving care probably more so Lake up because Lake up is the one that's gonna have to [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=848.14s)]
*  As they have them void out the player option you give them north of a hundred million bucks [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=853.48s)]
*  You're like, all right, you know [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=856.5799999999999s)]
*  Like I would never want to be an owner or a GM in that situation [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  We like the way we can take a chance here is giving Jimmy Butler two plus, you know [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=860.78s)]
*  Hundred million plus over the next two years, but Slater was like whatever the internal debates were it was what are we disrupting now? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=865.66s)]
*  Maybe non-playing team. So yeah cares [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=873.5s)]
*  Yeah, and that kind of ends the argument really especially we see these results [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=877.14s)]
*  Yeah, I said on the on the pod right after that. It wasn't a Hail Mary [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=881.14s)]
*  Was somewhere between a third and nine and a third and 13 and the guys kind of covered and you throw it anyway [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=885.74s)]
*  But the odds of Jimmy Butler just going to go and stay and being good immediately were pretty high and then the odds of him [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=891.0999999999999s)]
*  enjoying playing step with Steph [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=896.66s)]
*  That seemed pretty high and then just watching the weight of the world [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=898.86s)]
*  Be immediately lifted off steps. I this would have been a more fun segment [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=903.62s)]
*  If they hadn't gotten crushed by Philadelphia last night [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but he might did not watch Quinn Grimes went nuts Butler didn't play but can you believe Dallas traded Quentin Grimes? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=911.06s)]
*  Yeah, but whoa [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=917.78s)]
*  How about can you believe Philly traded for Quentin Grimes when it was clear that they were supposed to be headed toward a tank thing? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=919.06s)]
*  I'm [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=925.5s)]
*  Intentionally not this is not an overprepared bod because I wanted to do more back-and-forth stuff not have like set segments [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=927.02s)]
*  We'll nail it so far [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=932.78s)]
*  There's definitely a couple [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=936.66s)]
*  Big picture stuff I want to hit but the Philly thing which I was gonna mention later [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=938.3s)]
*  But we should talk about now because we had in B. There's a report yesterday and bead one to the owner [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=942.2199999999999s)]
*  It felt like this week was about Philly [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=947.06s)]
*  Trying to subtly pin stuff on on Darrell Mori the GM [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=950.38s)]
*  That that would you know? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=954.74s)]
*  We like that was something I saw on a show [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=957.3s)]
*  Well, they Darrell Mori was the one pushing for the in beat extension, right? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=959.9s)]
*  I'm just to interject quickly just are you going off of like the rumbling of like Josh Harris really was like [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=965.7s)]
*  Not sure that he wanted to do this. Yeah, can I can I we're talking about? Yeah, we have to hit this quickly because [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=972.3s)]
*  This is absurd and I'm not gonna allow it [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=978.86s)]
*  Ultimately one guy owns a basketball team and [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=982.1s)]
*  When it's that amount of money and it's that big of a decision that guy's making the call [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=985.38s)]
*  He's not deferring to the GM. He's not going I don't want to do this and that's a lot of money [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=989.14s)]
*  But Darrell says we should so I'm just gonna do it. It's it's not happening [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=994.38s)]
*  That's not how the league works. Like the reason cominga is still in the Warriors is because Joe Laker didn't want to trade cominga [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=998.18s)]
*  There's no other reason Joe Laker likes cominga [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1003.48s)]
*  He wants he doesn't want to give up on him and that's why he wasn't part of any of those trades [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1006.42s)]
*  the owners control the show and they're gonna decide what happens so [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1011.22s)]
*  They could pass the buck and I'm not defending Darrell because I thought I [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1015.22s)]
*  Would have rather resigned than give him be that extension, but nobody's gonna do that. There's 30 [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1019.58s)]
*  No, I would have been like listen [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1024.32s)]
*  Just can you can we just talk by out because this is the dumbest I can't believe we're doing this [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1026.42s)]
*  but then we're now in the bus throwing stage with this Philly situation and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1031.86s)]
*  They're in a weird spot because if they get the seventh pick and they don't end up with one of these top six picks in [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1036.2199999999998s)]
*  A draft that's awesome [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1041.86s)]
*  This is a catastrophic. We haven't ever had a season this bad for a team in ten years [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1043.54s)]
*  so you would disagree with my tweet about this being the second worst thing in front office has done unless you'll allow me the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1049.86s)]
*  The leniency that I'm including ownership in that because you're right [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1056.9799999999998s)]
*  I mean nobody [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1060.72s)]
*  Nobody goes as an owner like there's so much stuff that happens with ownership making the final calls and these things [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1061.68s)]
*  I think even sometimes I'll forget that not that I don't know it but I'd like that you're reminding us of it because it's never [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1067.0s)]
*  Happening without him saying yes. Okay, I'm in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1072.72s)]
*  It's three years [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1077.88s)]
*  192.9 million he has a player option in three years for 70 million dollars [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1080.3200000000002s)]
*  He's out for the season and then when you start hearing about breaking a bone in the leg to help recovery [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1084.2800000000002s)]
*  And I think there was a lot of stuff that was kind of nasty about this where I don't I forget who it was [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1090.0s)]
*  But basically laid out all the options for the 76ers [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1095.18s)]
*  Then it got turned into the 76ers were looking into the retirement exemption if he can't play again [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1098.2s)]
*  It's like look, we're not even there. It's like two years away from that, right? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1103.46s)]
*  My point of the entire extension was I remember when it happened. I all I could think of is will you have him? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1107.4s)]
*  wait, I know there was all the Nick stuff, you know, but [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1114.88s)]
*  You you have somebody who's basically missed half of their career [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1118.96s)]
*  Yeah, and you haven't really done anything with him. We know what the playoff regular season made the second round twice, right? So [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1123.52s)]
*  What's the rush? Also, you watch him in the Olympics you watched him in the Olympics not look 100% [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1132.4s)]
*  So what so if you don't sign him you still have under contract for two years [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1140.24s)]
*  You can't do the weight and see that what's he gonna do like hold out [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1144.68s)]
*  You know, it was just [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1148.48s)]
*  It's a catastrophic decision and it was bad when it happened. We talked about it when it happened [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1150.68s)]
*  We talked about it in our season preview. What did you think just out of curiosity? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1155.48s)]
*  What was the worst decision than that than that extension? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1158.64s)]
*  Well, you know Lucas on the Lakers now [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1162.84s)]
*  Fair I thought you were talking offseason. Yeah. Yeah Lucas you're right Luca trades [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1166.16s)]
*  number one [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1172.16s)]
*  Entrenched I've gone to three Lakers games [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1174.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're like you're when you buy in a jersey [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1177.0s)]
*  I'm mr. Laker right now. Yeah, you're just going [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1182.76s)]
*  You know just seeing him progressively get better better, which I know is shocking to some that he had missed [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1186.44s)]
*  Yeah two months a big guy who weighs 270 [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1191.0400000000002s)]
*  Didn't look super crisp right out of the gates. Yeah, and just seeing his progression [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1194.44s)]
*  Continue and the comfort and what comes with him being comfortable like as soon as he starts yelling and [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1201.12s)]
*  Getting pissed off. You're like, okay, this is this is heading in the right direction [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1208.56s)]
*  That's why I thought that first game that he played it against Utah was so funny because he was so tired [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1213.16s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't have time for any of that stuff and I think a lot of basketball players even the greatest ones [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1218.44s)]
*  They'll try to just find a way to fit in a little bit and with Luca it's like I don't know [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1225.24s)]
*  Don't don't try to fit in just go ahead and play your style [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1229.76s)]
*  which I know we're gonna do some Lakers stuff because I saw your clip this week and and I'm with you that the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1233.28s)]
*  Biggest compliment is that now? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1240.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what the ceiling is on the possibility for this team, which I think a lot of us thought when this trade happened [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1242.0s)]
*  It's like, okay that might ruin 25 [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1247.2s)]
*  But it makes all the sense the world because now you get to reset your franchise and now I think that conversation has shifted [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1248.84s)]
*  quite a bit here [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1254.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's the thing he used to do in Dallas and I've been interested in why because I know JJ knows it [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1256.52s)]
*  I think JJ's done a really good job this year [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1261.92s)]
*  Lucas one of those do I have it or not in the first quarter guys? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1264.24s)]
*  Which I think Tatum's a little bit like this too where they'll use the first quarter to see stuff does it all the time? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1267.76s)]
*  And I think the Lakers have already been like yeah you figure out in the first quarter how you are [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1275.0s)]
*  and I've been so impressed by LeBron just kind of [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1279.36s)]
*  All right, I'll I'll wait and see too and then I'll see where I fit in today [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1282.64s)]
*  And then he always gets his stats and he's been you know [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1286.64s)]
*  I'm sure you saw it in person like he's as active as he's been in a couple years [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1289.8600000000001s)]
*  But the defensive stuff that LeBron is doing because you know, I think it's totally fair where when they're bad defensively a lot of it [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1293.44s)]
*  You know [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  There's there's stuff that I know that we'll get into and I don't know how much rotational Laker stuff you want to talk about [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1302.72s)]
*  Between now and where they were they were bad defensive team, but you know, he's had ups and downs [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1306.48s)]
*  But there I mean this group where you went Luca reads LeBron on the perimeter now [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1311.04s)]
*  No AD behind it like how good can they be defensively and they've been incredible and I'm actually gonna give a little credit here [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1315.6599999999999s)]
*  Because Greg St. Gene who's the son of Gary? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1322.12s)]
*  The longtime Warriors exec the key was with the Lakers when LeBron was there before then he was at Dallas with Luca [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1325.3999999999999s)]
*  then he comes back on a JJ staff and [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1332.3999999999999s)]
*  I know him a little bit. So certainly I'm biased be like hey you doing anything tonight [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1335.04s)]
*  I'd be like I'm installing our you know entry passes against you guys and it's like alright, you know [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1339.32s)]
*  He's just he's just one of those guys would be a head coach at some point this alternate pin down defense. I'm working on [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1343.76s)]
*  pin down three [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1349.12s)]
*  Yeah, we're working on a lot of side out-of-bounds stuff today. I [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1350.8s)]
*  Think his relationship with the players like in the fact that these two superstars, you know been there [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1355.8799999999999s)]
*  I think JJ has a lot to do with it [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1361.6s)]
*  They're just so much more prepared as a basketball team and there was also stuff like at one point when the record wasn't that bad [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  Much better. They're like, oh JJ read it because let's face it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1368.32s)]
*  Like most people were rooting against JJ being successful because of the background but NBA head coaching paths are [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1371.2s)]
*  Are very non-traditional. Okay. I mean this has been going on for 20 plus [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1377.52s)]
*  I don't even know maybe even longer than that you would know better than I would how many times you're like, okay [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1381.28s)]
*  I guess they're just gonna make that guy head coach and I remember when the records are similar [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1385.4399999999998s)]
*  There was a bit like oh [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1388.48s)]
*  Well, this isn't any better than Darwin Ham and you watch them now and how prepared they are whether it was the Denver game [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1389.2s)]
*  We were talking about just a week ago [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1394.6s)]
*  This team has has figured some stuff out on dense on defense that I just didn't think was possible. I [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1396.6799999999998s)]
*  agree and and even when you're watching them it still feels like they have like legitimate holes and [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1402.52s)]
*  Yet collectively they figured out how to cover up for a lot of them [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1408.7199999999998s)]
*  Like I still feel like the right kind of point guard can just get whatever shot they want [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1411.9199999999998s)]
*  and then you want a bench some of the bench guys that just don't trust at all, but it works and everybody it's like JJ said [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1416.1599999999999s)]
*  Couple weeks ago that the biggest lesson he learned as coach during the season was it's all about whether you guys play hard and [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1422.86s)]
*  It's the most simple point ever wouldn't be an interesting mind the game episode [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1429.9399999999998s)]
*  But I think this is the recurring theme for the best teams in the league like all of them give a shit game to game [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1434.1s)]
*  Quarter to quarter half to half and the Lakers to their credit [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1439.86s)]
*  It's a it's impressive and then you look at Philly on the flip side of that [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1443.78s)]
*  Where how many times did you watch a Philly quarter where you're like, this is the worst thing I've ever seen [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1447.26s)]
*  What's happening? Why? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1452.14s)]
*  How are they allowing this? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1454.22s)]
*  Same for the Phoenix Suns where they're just like yeah, she's gonna go in the corner [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1456.5s)]
*  Not if I'm not getting the ball. I might not run back. Yeah [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1460.8600000000001s)]
*  the crazy thing about the suns group is [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1465.3000000000002s)]
*  Normally you could point to like lack of rotational consistency last year and yet they still hadn't like you look at last year's season and [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1468.98s)]
*  You thought last year was a disappointment because you just go imagine if they had all three guys [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1476.5s)]
*  Yeah, would they have this like 48 they were the 60 weren't they? Yeah, so they're like 47 48 wins. You have this quirky [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1480.5800000000002s)]
*  Clutch stat that doesn't even make any sense of how bad they were offensively and yeah [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1488.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, there's no way that'll happen again. Then when I was looking at it for my show [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1492.7s)]
*  You look at the three dudes and you're getting this elite shot making this incredible output [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1496.14s)]
*  It's almost like 80 points per game [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1500.54s)]
*  I think in February when I did the numbers for those guys and then it's like yeah, but everything else [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1501.7s)]
*  Like doesn't work. I know bowl bowls had a really nice run here, but let me actually Laker minute all ball Asian you [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1506.18s)]
*  Scattering report if he has a clean look on the kitchen three, he's probably gonna reset himself and move. All right [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1513.6200000000001s)]
*  Long in I would add that put long for Bobo long [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1521.94s)]
*  Long length long which is one of my favorite things I've ever seen be careful be careful attacking him long in [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1526.14s)]
*  November the Lakers were 25th on defense. They were eight and six that month. They were 20 25th on defense, right? So it felt worse [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1533.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you're looking at it going out [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1540.1399999999999s)]
*  Probably gonna be their thing. They're just not gonna be very good defensively. Why would that be? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1543.58s)]
*  Well, DeAngelo Russell for that month 26 minutes a game cam reddish 21 minutes a game [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1546.86s)]
*  It's all connect was making threes be playing 26 minutes per game [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1551.1s)]
*  You look at where they're at now in their last ten and then if I give you the their number two defense in the NBA [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1554.4199999999998s)]
*  Behind your Detroit Pistons who are just their own story and they're like fourth in the last 20 I think too [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1561.74s)]
*  So it's it's getting better each every ten game stretch is better than the last thing in stretch [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1568.46s)]
*  When you shoot it well and you play defense, you're gonna win a bunch of games [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1573.42s)]
*  So the February minutes look at the breakdown so you're replacing the Teangelo Russell 26 minutes a game depending on the month [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1576.18s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm just using November in February during Phinney Smith's 30 minutes a game [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1581.96s)]
*  Yeah, Vando who just hacks the shit out of everybody but he's in there for 15 minutes fighting his ass off [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1587.1799999999998s)]
*  Dalton's only playing 13 minutes a game [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1592.86s)]
*  He's also not shooting great in February [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1595.62s)]
*  Then Jordan Goodwin comes in and wreaks havoc on everybody and LeBron's had the second [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1597.5s)]
*  Second or kind of tied for second best defensive rating of any of the main regulars [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1601.8999999999999s)]
*  So right to a LeBron back as part of all this because he was one way LeBron for two months. That's the point. Yeah [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1606.3799999999999s)]
*  It's been really good [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1614.06s)]
*  The Philly thing I don't know what the answer is. Did you look at the lottery odds? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1616.22s)]
*  The thing is if they fit it they're probably gonna be sixth and all it takes is one team to jump them [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1622.62s)]
*  it's this incredible lottery thing because [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1627.86s)]
*  If they if they don't keep the top six one team jumps them and they fall back to seven [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1631.3s)]
*  And then okay, so he gets that pick and okay sees what could be like a 64 win team [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1637.34s)]
*  Probably gonna be in the finals and they're gonna get the seventh pick eighth pick in this awesome draft that I've been [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1641.68s)]
*  Dabbling in a little bit. I'm starting to get some draft opinions [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1648.3200000000002s)]

*  But this looks like if you're in the top five in this draft you're getting somebody that is gonna be legitimately exciting [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1652.0s)]
*  Right, like if you got edge calm with the fifth pick, it's like that guy might be awesome [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1658.8400000000001s)]
*  He might be [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1663.92s)]

*  There's really only the we got a trade Booker move and it just seems like they're adamant. They're not gonna trade them [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1690.48s)]
*  I just don't think they're gonna get a lot for Durant [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1695.48s)]

*  Green and chingun are totally fine realizing that like Thompson might be the best player or is there a Booker trade that you just overwhelm them? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1780.24s)]
*  I know you don't want to trade Devin Booker, but how about this? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=1788.5s)]

*  It's amazing to me when when people dwell on the negativity [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2030.78s)]
*  There's other reasons for the negativity [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2034.46s)]

*  I think anybody that does anything that is publicly consumed but that's the point. It's not just the NBA [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2074.3s)]
*  Everyone has more access to the alternate side of what you want to hear in all vocations in life [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2081.46s)]

*  Okay more negative towards their stars [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2099.94s)]

*  He stopped talking to everybody [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2209.02s)]
*  He stopped talking to the media and then he retired and people like is he retiring because it's too much pressure [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2210.26s)]
*  Kevin Johnson took a ton of shit couldn't stay healthy 94 finals [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2215.58s)]
*  Pippen didn't take the shot in the 94 playoffs and still carries it 30 years later David Robinson too nice loser [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2219.9s)]
*  Well didn't even come back in when it was back in and then wore that you know for 30 years [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2226.94s)]
*  Dream team 94 I promise you was not popular when it happened people were not happy with it [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2233.58s)]
*  Shaq in the entire 1990s people bitched about when is he gonna take basketball seriously? Why does he do all this other stuff? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2239.46s)]
*  Why is he doing movies and music? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2246.34s)]
*  Patrick Ewing could have won the big one Carl Malone who took more shit than Carl Malone in the last two [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2248.34s)]
*  Finals he was in Iverson which I think has come around and it's like this beloved figure now [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2253.38s)]
*  He was not beloved in the 90s in the early 2000s. He took a ton of shit Christian Leitner bus [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2258.7400000000002s)]
*  Disappointment all those late 90 guys when we head into that lockout [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2264.54s)]
*  Remember how much people how mad people are at the league these guys are making so much money [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2268.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there was any Anderson can't feed his family all that shit there was so much [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2272.62s)]
*  We've definitely progressed with you go all the way back to the strike in the NFL in the early 80s [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2278.22s)]
*  Right and how much society there wasn't one person going you realize you're arguing for the owners to make more money [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2283.74s)]
*  And that's what always pisses me off [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2291.56s)]
*  It's like okay [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2293.2599999999998s)]
*  You want to look at these players and look at their salaries and say that they're selfish and they're entitled and all this shit [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2293.88s)]
*  But ultimately what you're saying when you hope they get paid less or lose at the collective bargaining agreement table [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2298.52s)]
*  You're hoping these guys big boy. Yeah, make more money [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2303.48s)]
*  And I can't identify with somebody who's making that much money. That was an attitude through the 90s [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2306.72s)]
*  I have a couple more Jason kid traded twice took a ton of shit [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2311.5s)]
*  Chris Weber one of those trades. Well, one of those trades had to happen, but the Dallas trade [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2315.4s)]
*  Chris Weber [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2321.3s)]
*  Was an all-time hot potato guy and we called him out all the time his Washington career was incredibly disappointing [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2322.96s)]
*  He got to Sacramento and it's like watch C web [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2328.48s)]
*  He's gonna turn completely away from the basket to hear the bottom back baby. He wants no part of this [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2330.72s)]
*  We made fun of him Kobe. I would say was the most picked apart athlete in the 2000s [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2335.04s)]
*  I wouldn't even say football player and that you might go paint manning [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2340.76s)]
*  But there was a lot of Kobe stuff that then when he won the two titles at the end of the decade [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2344.6s)]
*  Then it kind of circled around the other way, but it got right and there was the trial [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2348.92s)]
*  there's a whole bunch of stuff with Kobe, but [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2354.04s)]
*  if you go to the [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2356.36s)]
*  2004 finals 05 06 07 [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2358.64s)]
*  Him not shooting in the second half of that Suns game and how nuts we all went after the fact not great [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2362.16s)]
*  TMAC can't win Vince quit on Toronto. He's soft KG can't win Dirk who took more shit than Dirk from [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2368.68s)]
*  06-2011 he's soft. He's a choke artist. He's a loser [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2377.76s)]
*  Like he I think he took probably other than Kobe the most Dwight Howard. I keep going the point is [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2381.64s)]
*  For whatever reason this has been the league and I think it's because you have these personalities that drive teams [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2387.7400000000002s)]
*  People feel really attached to them either they're defensive and passionate about them or they're mad at them [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2393.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's just the ebb and flow in the league [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2398.7000000000003s)]
*  I honestly think it's better than it's ever been with this stuff. You can find hate anywhere if you go online [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2400.62s)]
*  Doesn't mean that people hate LeBron has like 50 million Instagram followers [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2406.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, look I know enough about those timelines like I just remember [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2412.26s)]
*  You know when Jordan scored all the points against the Celtics then lost and you'd be playing a little league baseball [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2416.7799999999997s)]
*  Tournament and every coach is sitting there as bike shorts [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2421.8199999999997s)]
*  You know shitting on Jordan now granted growing up in New England was the wrong place [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2425.18s)]
*  Because all these guys are going home to worship their Larry Bird altar, but maybe should add 68. Yeah, right like [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2430.66s)]
*  the collective [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2438.38s)]
*  He yeah cool scoring bro [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2440.74s)]
*  But the lack of respect for who Jordan was because he was losing to these older more superior battle-tested [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2443.34s)]
*  well-rounded basketball teams like Jordan would have had a very [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2449.94s)]
*  Like people would have destroyed him if he played now [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2454.58s)]
*  Through the first seven years of his career without winning anything because it's like if you're the best, you know [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2458.34s)]
*  You have that kind of attention on you. I feel like people destroyed them back in the day [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2463.3s)]
*  I thought that was a you know, that was a big narrative of his career is like yeah, he's super fun [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2467.08s)]
*  but he's Birdie Magic won titles and he didn't like that my point is this has been a narrative that we've heard forever and [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2472.38s)]
*  If you don't win titles and you don't come through [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2479.58s)]
*  In the NBA you're gonna take crap but I also feel like that goes for the NBA for the NFL [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2483.06s)]
*  Right. It goes for baseball with somebody like Clint Kershaw. This is what we do with sports [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2487.9s)]
*  If you don't we don't even do it. But here's the thing. We don't even do it with baseball anymore [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2492.1800000000003s)]
*  So like that's because I was thinking about this face of the league stuff [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2495.58s)]
*  Yeah, I want to go that too right like LeBron when you are as great as you are [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2498.98s)]
*  Unfortunately part of that deal is you're held to the standard where everything is dissected and aunt got a little taste of that [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2505.44s)]
*  Because aunt was coming up approval rating through the roof. He's so much fun [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2511.62s)]
*  He starts talking a little shit and then they get eliminated. They get eliminated on a May [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2515.72s)]
*  30th right I looked it up and then he had the receipts commercial on [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2521.7s)]
*  May 31st like they had that one ready to go [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2528.66s)]
*  Where you're showing like how much this is impacting players? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2532.3399999999997s)]
*  I know silver talked about this years ago where he just said look we have a league [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2535.94s)]
*  Where our stars and I'm paraphrasing here [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2539.8599999999997s)]
*  So I hope I'm not to remove from the tone of what he was saying [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2541.94s)]
*  But I think I have it and it was like you kind of have a bunch of guys at the top that are pretty miserable [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2545.18s)]
*  Like a lot of players really miss that was when I did that interview with them at the slum conference [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2549.7s)]
*  That's when he started talking about the unhappiness with the players. That was 2018 range [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2554.1s)]
*  storyline for seven years [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2559.1s)]
*  It's like why aren't our players happier? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2561.18s)]
*  Right. So, you know aunt has had probably this this shift because the Olympics didn't go the way he thought it would go [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2564.02s)]
*  I mean he wasn't even out on the floor for some of that stuff. He didn't look super comfortable after talking a lot of shit [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2571.3399999999997s)]
*  You know again, I don't look at it and go like oh man [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2577.42s)]
*  Now I have to reevaluate what I think about you [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2579.66s)]
*  But aunt is very predictably going to have if he doesn't have some kind of playoff success here in the next couple years [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2581.98s)]
*  It's going to turn back to everything you just said in your timeline of like hey [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2587.5s)]
*  I thought this was supposed to be the guy [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2590.9s)]
*  You hope you're one of those guys in this sport because I was thinking about aunt relation [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2593.58s)]
*  Like has anybody ever talked about De'Aaron Fox like De'Aaron Fox is a really good player makes a lot of sense for the Spurs [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2598.78s)]
*  I think it's a bit like the Donovan Mitchell thing. We're like, yeah, it's not perfect, but he's really good [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2603.86s)]
*  And if we keep waiting around I like what this magical [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2608.14s)]
*  Acquisitional be and we might be waiting forever [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2611.94s)]
*  But De'Aaron Fox has never talked about that so there's this group outside of these I don't know seven to eight players [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2614.5s)]
*  We obsess about every single season. There's this group that's not even part of that and again baseball the sport [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2620.82s)]
*  We don't even have any of those dudes anymore right now that we have a tiny and nobody's like, oh tiny face of the league [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2626.18s)]
*  I don't know where that the face of the league. It's more personal basketball [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2632.3s)]
*  It's just way more personal than the other two sports are [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2636.62s)]
*  Yeah, you think it doesn't it feel like the attachment? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2639.06s)]
*  I mean sure we could pick a bunch of quarterbacks that are as big as stars as any NBA [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2642.02s)]
*  You got helmets on during game [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2645.9s)]
*  I've said this forever basketball is the most naked sport whether you're at the game or you're watching TV [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2647.62s)]
*  You feel like you have this connection with players [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2652.8599999999997s)]
*  That's just different than the other sports [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2655.7s)]
*  It just is especially if you're going and you're watching them and you're watching during timeouts [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2657.66s)]
*  You're watching them interact in foul lines and that turn free throws and I think the social media aspect of it where they can connect [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2662.14s)]
*  To fans immediately they can see fed feedback immediately. Obviously that's not awesome [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2668.8s)]
*  but I think in some ways it's it's better for them too because [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  You know in the old days you could just like whatever like I think of back to the Peter Vesey [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2678.2000000000003s)]
*  New York Post pieces of the 80s and he would just like, you know, he was just absolutely completely eviscerate people [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2683.0800000000004s)]
*  He called Alonzo morning the Oregon Groner [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2689.76s)]
*  Right [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2695.04s)]
*  It's a it's just a little different now and you can mobilize people you can mobilize all your followers against somebody there's [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2696.8s)]
*  That the face of the league thing. Yeah, what that's another one [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2704.88s)]
*  I don't think I've I've allowed you this well because I think it goes for it. No, I think it goes together [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2708.6800000000003s)]
*  I think I think with the face of the league thing. We probably see it the same way [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2713.28s)]
*  You don't talk about it [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2718.84s)]
*  It's not like the people magazine sexiest man of the year issue where we just nominate somebody [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2720.34s)]
*  Yeah, is that who it was this year you are [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2725.6s)]
*  The problem you kind of take it right and when you think about like I I've never when I was in the 80s [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2728.7200000000003s)]
*  Loving basketball. I was never like I wonder the face of the league is right now. We didn't talk about it [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2735.84s)]
*  We didn't talk about in the 90s [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2740.0s)]
*  Bird and magic because they won magic one of titles a rookie and bird one the title is in his second year [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2741.7200000000003s)]
*  The league just sort of shifted to them because they won and then bird had the three MVPs two titles [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2747.36s)]
*  Then magic had three MVPs in four years and he won two titles and it was just obvious [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2753.2s)]
*  Those were the guys and then Jordan beat magic in the 91 finals and guess what? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2758.2799999999997s)]
*  That made him the guy and then Jordan went through all the 90s and then it was like Shaq and Kobe together [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2763.24s)]
*  I guess this is their league now and then that fell apart and in the mid 2000s were like [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2768.2s)]
*  Duncan Spurs sure like no [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2774.7999999999997s)]
*  wasn't like we're like Tim Duncan's now the face in the league because one of the cases [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2777.24s)]
*  You see what this face the league stuff is like go if Tatum wins three in a row [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2780.84s)]
*  He's now the face of the league. I don't think it works that way. It kind of organically happens [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2783.96s)]
*  Kobe had at the end of the 2000s [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2789.0s)]
*  Eventually, it shifted to LeBron and then it shifted to the LeBron and Curry together and that's just kind of what happened [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2791.6s)]
*  We can't nominate Anthony Edwards. It's not like this would happen in tennis sometimes especially in the 80s [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2797.72s)]
*  It'd be like Boris Becker see the face of tennis now because he won Wimbledon once it's like it's not how it works [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2803.64s)]
*  You kind of ease into it. Nobody would pick Agassi and then it eventually became oh, it's Agassi and Sampras [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2809.84s)]
*  What about a bomb? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2815.84s)]
*  He have the belt he had the belt there for a little bit. I he it never took it kept falling off him [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2816.84s)]
*  But the point with the face of the league now is like yeah [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2823.6000000000004s)]
*  It's still Steph and curry and then somebody's gonna have to win a couple titles and take it from him [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2826.32s)]
*  But if Wemby comes in and wins two straight titles, and he's the best part in the league [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2830.1400000000003s)]
*  He's the face the league. I just don't know what that means. We're so low. What does the face of the league mean? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2834.2000000000003s)]
*  Just you know attention. I think we know it without defining it. You think Steph's the face of the league over LeBron [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2838.84s)]
*  I think the two of them together are really in the last ten years. I [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2843.96s)]
*  Do I think it's the two of them together? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2848.6400000000003s)]
*  I [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2851.44s)]
*  Don't know man. I mean it's you could point to what I do [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2852.6800000000003s)]
*  It's really about talking point [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2858.6000000000004s)]
*  Okay, and I think what happens is is there's this cycle of like aunt going? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2860.36s)]
*  I don't necessarily want it because then it's like what are you supposed to do? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2864.94s)]
*  You're supposed to say what so he's not gonna like try to win the finals like if he wins the title [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2868.98s)]
*  And he's the best part in the league guess what you get? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2873.82s)]
*  Whatever this amorphous made-up face of the league thing is because you become the guy like to me [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2877.46s)]
*  Don't you also have to be the best player though because even if Tatum [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2882.6s)]
*  I mean that's a lot of work to do by the way for Tatum just hey let's add two more titles to this [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2885.7400000000002s)]
*  Right greatest he is he wasn't very good today, which I know we'll get to later, but [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2890.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know that he would ever be [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2894.98s)]
*  The face the league because I've never thought of him as the best player in the league at least with step [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2897.5s)]
*  There were seasons where I thought he played better the LeBron [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2901.54s)]
*  I never thought he was actually a better basketball player at LeBron so to be face the league you also have to be at some point [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2903.78s)]
*  Because I know you've done this in the past with your belt hole [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2909.94s)]
*  I just a really good way to look at the league like who has the belt who had the belt then how many belt [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2912.1s)]
*  Transfers are we talking about Yoko? Just had the belt for a really long stretch [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2916.58s)]
*  Which is really hard, but there's a popularity piece that you could just doesn't have he's just not gonna have that's why [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2919.94s)]
*  Curry and LeBron are the meal tickets to the league they're the guys who are gonna be in the Saturday 830 game the most they're the guys [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2925.26s)]
*  Who are gonna sell the most jerseys have the most interest and if they're on a good team people are gonna care the most and it's [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2931.1800000000003s)]
*  Those two what did you think of LeBron's quote? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2936.2200000000003s)]
*  Is that it turned in which one but basically was like I didn't ask for it and then it pivoted into [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2938.94s)]
*  Everybody that covers the league just shits on it essentially that we're all too negative I [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2945.34s)]
*  Mean I would just have an opinion on his opinion. I don't think it's true though [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2951.26s)]
*  Because I think when when you hit the point where you're kind of the guy in the league or one of the two guys [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2958.38s)]
*  There's a lot of great stuff that comes with that [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2963.34s)]
*  You know you make the most money you make the most money off the court [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2966.26s)]
*  You probably have the best chance to win you can convince the most people to come play with you on like a you know [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2969.46s)]
*  On a buyout contract you can put the most pressure on your owners to do whatever you want them to do you can make them [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2975.06s)]
*  Trade everything they have for Anthony Davis like there's real benefits to it [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2981.94s)]
*  I I don't think it's like this heavy burden. I think for an [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2986.42s)]
*  It's more a scrutiny thing that he's probably talking about like hey if you hit this level [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2991.3s)]
*  You're gonna be picked apart in a way. That's just a little different, but that's I mean that could be anybody right that could be Timothy [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=2995.94s)]
*  Chalamet right now [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3001.94s)]
*  That could be whoever is like whoever you think is the biggest hip-hop star right now [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3003.54s)]
*  It doesn't just kind of comes to the territory if you're the best at anything you do [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3007.46s)]
*  I don't I don't know why that would be a burden [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3011.94s)]
*  There's there's good and bad to everything [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3015.86s)]
*  But I do wonder like the negativity thing. Yeah, like I'll have pods where I'll think [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3018.66s)]
*  Are you harping on the same stuff? Yes [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3026.1s)]
*  Again if we're doing a basketball pot and like whatever the headline was that week like you're gonna stay topical [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3029.3s)]
*  You're gonna play the hits, but there'll be certain players [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3034.46s)]
*  I'm like there's just nothing else for you to say anymore like it's established. How do you feel? There's nothing new [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3036.26s)]
*  You're not the center of some cost as a topic for us [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3041.48s)]
*  There's nothing else we could say about the Suns to share at this point, right? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3044.26s)]
*  like I've liked a rant for such a long time, but this past year plus and [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3047.82s)]
*  Not to bring up the hockey tweet like a third time [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3053.1000000000004s)]
*  But he's just like how could you possibly think that that's a good point? How could you think? Yeah, just basically telling everybody [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3055.28s)]
*  Fuck off when it's like man. You're the one [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3061.2000000000003s)]
*  That's also like part of it too. It's like this league is so different with how powerful the players are that [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3065.0s)]
*  You know, did you think you were gonna get no criticism? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3071.6800000000003s)]
*  Signing contracts and then asking out before an extension and I kicked in [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3074.5600000000004s)]
*  Right or how you treated all-star weekend, which was you know, the first time the football season ends [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3078.96s)]
*  The first time basketball is really in the limelight for real is all-star weekend and that everybody treats it like shit [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3085.28s)]
*  It's like we're supposed to say thanks [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3090.84s)]
*  Like what's our what's our role? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3094.32s)]
*  Everyone went to us. I've talked to a bunch of people to all-star weekend and they were all like it was fucking miserable [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3096.32s)]
*  It sucked. It was awful and the timing of it is so bad for all the good players like nothing you don't care [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3101.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's like okay. The window is finally shifted like you are outside of the football shadow [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3109.88s)]
*  Like own this week and it's like nope [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3115.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. Not only we're not gonna own the week. We're going to embarrass the league [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3118.5600000000004s)]
*  Again, and I don't care about that week. I haven't cared about it for years [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3123.0400000000004s)]
*  I think I've watched the game once in the last 15 [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3126.28s)]
*  This is not new that the players don't necessarily care, but they're not making the most opportunities [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3128.52s)]
*  I think all of us are more negative than we are positive. Okay, I think that but that's just life [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3133.5600000000004s)]
*  I think everybody I don't think that's a basketball situation. I think that's what part is it like that [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3138.32s)]
*  I'm just saying like the internet breeds that if you go to are you like that your family? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3144.32s)]
*  No, I'm saying you go into Twitter applies you go on a reddit. I remember I was I was at a I [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3149.44s)]
*  Went to Goldsparer's class in Austin and they did all these studies on different things about how to follow basketball [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3156.0s)]
*  And one of the one of the things was about NBA read it [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3161.6800000000003s)]
*  Just the percentages of positive tweets first negative tweets [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3165.32s)]
*  Are not post negative post comments versus positive at the league and [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3169.3599999999997s)]
*  If I just told you they did that what would your response be? What would you think it would be probably? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3174.7999999999997s)]
*  What would the ratio be for you? Just guessing I? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3179.24s)]
*  Think it's gonna be low. I mean the way you're leading this I have to pick a massive split on it [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3183.72s)]
*  So I'll say 80% negative now wasn't that it wasn't that bad [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3188.04s)]
*  I I prejudice you by with my lead in but it was like [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3191.12s)]
*  35 65 or 30 70 something like that, but just people are more prone when they're on [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3195.16s)]
*  Any sort of forum like that to be negative than positive that's just you just have to know that going in [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3201.68s)]
*  I would argue that people at the games are [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3206.52s)]
*  way nicer [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3209.92s)]
*  Way nicer. It's not even close [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3211.56s)]
*  I would love for people to go in a time machine and go to like the Fleet Center in 1996 [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3214.16s)]
*  Just get a feel for what those two hours were like with like an angry [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3218.7999999999997s)]
*  You know fan base that didn't like the product and just had the freedom to just yell at everybody like it's [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3223.0400000000004s)]
*  Now I look now I I think it's actually like a pretty nice experience like there will be stories about oh there was a heck or [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3230.4s)]
*  Who yelled at somebody they kicked him out like fucking a like there was 30 of those [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3236.6800000000003s)]
*  I remember going to a Golden State Sacramento game [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3241.44s)]
*  When I was visiting my buddies in San Francisco in like 98 and I had no idea that the Golden State fans hated Chris Weber so much [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3243.96s)]
*  So it's 99 it was that first season and they were just booing him yelling him [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3250.96s)]
*  It was like a two and a half hour Chris Weber roast in the stands anything he did [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3255.52s)]
*  They're going nuts like that. Those days are over [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3260.4s)]
*  We don't see the rant and okay see that comeback game was probably the last time anything like that happened, right? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3262.68s)]
*  Yeah getting a fan removed and [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3269.36s)]
*  Then it becomes because the player has the power to have that happen now [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3272.6s)]
*  Yeah, it'll become like a topic and then you know if it's a really slow day [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3276.84s)]
*  Now you'll discuss like what what does this mean? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3281.8s)]
*  Yeah, and I think there's some players that actually like to look for it a little bit more than other players [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3285.84s)]
*  And you realize like this thing that is definitely an improvement to the experience for the player a massive because you're completely right about that [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3291.36s)]
*  Like going to some of these crowds going to baseball stadiums going back to Foxboro in the day [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3299.32s)]
*  I mean just you wouldn't even want to bring a kid. Well baseball everyone's on their phone [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3304.96s)]
*  So that's the probably the safest place you can be an athlete [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3309.2s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking up unless a foul ball's coming at them [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3312.8s)]
*  Which can't happen because there's a net the bleachers used to be about how drunk were you gonna get and how many fights were they? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3315.7200000000003s)]
*  Going to be and how man what can you yell at the other players and stay and stay in the park? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3322.06s)]
*  Right. So then when a player has a fan removed then it becomes kind of this [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3326.84s)]
*  Think piece of like the dynamic of respect and all these different things like what can you have happening you're like, yeah, but [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3332.2400000000002s)]
*  No one was ever removed in the past. So it actually happened at a much greater rate. You just [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3338.96s)]
*  Just the way it was I just think every year a little bit different [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3344.7200000000003s)]
*  Listen if if players feel a certain way, I'm certainly gonna tell them not to feel that way [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3348.52s)]
*  I do think a big piece of this is self-inflicted though by the league the schedules too long [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3352.9s)]
*  If we if we had a 70 game season or a 60 game season [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3357.62s)]
*  I don't have to watch these extra 20 games of the Suns, right? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3361.54s)]
*  There's more urgency for the games the the load management stuff [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3365.58s)]
*  Which we've talked about ad nauseum that made it hard for players for fans to connect with the with the league and players, right? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3369.4199999999996s)]
*  The players call way too much shit for that though, you know, but I think it made it hard [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3376.06s)]
*  It was something that got brought up and I do think it mattered to fans that they bought a ticket and the guy wasn't there [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3379.8999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely, I'm not saying like that's gonna be the worst experience [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3385.94s)]
*  Especially you don't have the budget to go to more than one game a year and then you bring your kid and he's all fired up [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3388.82s)]
*  He's got the jersey on and they're not playing [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3394.06s)]
*  I think there were certain teams like I really think what the Spurs did [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3395.62s)]
*  In a very Belichick way to just be like hey, you know what TNT Thursday night? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3399.1s)]
*  Yeah, remember remember the ABC game how bad it got there for a while where you were like, are you guys seriously? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3402.98s)]
*  Like giving the league and your television partner this much of a fuck you [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3410.7s)]
*  Just hey, we're just gonna sit everybody. Yeah, and I understand like what the science and by the way the science has proven [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3414.6200000000003s)]
*  Very little because it's not like we go to the playoffs like every playoff story is littered with like two or three major injuries [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3421.38s)]
*  So I'm not sure I'm not expecting that everybody was just gonna be healthy all the time [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3428.36s)]
*  But I don't know if that's had the positive impact that everybody thought it would be when they wrote about it for non-stop [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3431.38s)]
*  for years wrote about it non-stop four years, but [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3435.78s)]
*  that [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3439.3s)]
*  That's part of it, I don't know man, I guess sometimes I wonder you know clearly with this pod we've got a large audience [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3441.82s)]
*  sometimes I feel like I'm [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3449.9s)]
*  Too negative and instead of like having LeBron give this quote or some of it like look with his quotes [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3451.98s)]
*  I don't love all of them. All right [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3458.0600000000004s)]
*  But he's been giving us quotes over two plus decades [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3460.9s)]
*  So which public figure would I ever be like, you know what everything he said for 20 plus years? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3463.1400000000003s)]
*  I've liked everything he said that person doesn't exist [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3467.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's impossible to have the chalamet approval rating after the two decade plus run for LeBron [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3470.66s)]
*  But when I started thinking about like just negativity him saying everyone is too negative. Well, no, that's not the case [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3478.02s)]
*  But then I'll I'll know like of all the games that I watch [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3485.14s)]
*  especially when it's on like the national broadcast and like brawny comes into a game and then the [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3488.94s)]
*  Broadcasters start talking about like how hard he works. You're like dude, he's got an NBA uniform on and he's not good and [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3493.66s)]
*  He shouldn't be out there and this whole thing's kind of a joke [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3500.06s)]
*  So let's evaluate it that way [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3504.2999999999997s)]
*  But right there there will be no like that won't happen. So it actually strengthens your point [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3506.34s)]
*  Whenever those broadcasts like that's when I feel like am I being negative or am I being like just a basketball fan? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3513.02s)]
*  With the way that the national broadcast is discussing a game or discussing certain players when you just go hey this person and again [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3520.58s)]
*  Maybe I shouldn't even use Ronnie [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3527.7799999999997s)]
*  But that was just one that jumped out is like you guys are gonna do four minutes on like the positives here or or like Philly [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3528.94s)]
*  Before the start of this season when there was pieces about here's their plan to win a championship and it was like [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3534.18s)]
*  Hey, part of the plan is that it beats not gonna play back to back soon more [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3540.42s)]
*  But here's what they're trying to do. They're trying to be healthy and be it's not gonna play back to backs anymore [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3543.62s)]
*  His name might be fucked up. I don't know it just I [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3548.1s)]
*  There's only supposed to be positive about him be are we supposed to be positive Philly situation or all of it? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3552.7s)]
*  I I just feel like for us like one of the reasons I think we connected and became friends and we liked doing the pot [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3560.18s)]
*  together is we really love basketball like I'll both of us will be watching these random games on [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3566.58s)]
*  stupid nights and we really give a shit about it and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3571.62s)]
*  You [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3574.78s)]
*  Can't just talk about all the stuff you like like it like you got to have a little balance both ways [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3576.34s)]
*  but I think I think we celebrate the game as much we criticize it there's other shows and and [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3582.26s)]
*  personalities that I think kind of dine and the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3588.78s)]
*  This gets me attention if I do this. I don't feel like we do that [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3591.78s)]
*  Like I always feel like we're having a conversation about things [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3595.94s)]
*  We like and don't like about the league like I love watching Detroit right now [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3598.28s)]
*  I could do ten minutes on Ron Holland right now. I [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3601.78s)]
*  Fucking love Ron Holland Ron Hollins. I haven't even watched I probably watch [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3606.1800000000003s)]
*  15% of the Pistons games or pieces 20% Ron Holland seems like he's ready to get into it with everybody on every team [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3611.5400000000004s)]
*  He's like 19 years old. I really like watching them. I appreciate the Pistons. I'm excited to watch them play the Knicks in round one [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3617.86s)]
*  I think if you lose that side of things it becomes harder for me to [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3625.0600000000004s)]
*  Take your criticisms seriously, you still have to fundamentally like what you're watching. I don't feel like some people out there do I [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3629.86s)]
*  Just like calling out the bullshit [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3638.46s)]
*  Because I think there's a lot of it whether [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3641.06s)]
*  it's [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3643.58s)]
*  another media member's quote because then there's some guys that are just only positive and I think [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3644.6600000000003s)]
*  You're you just [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3651.1000000000004s)]
*  This much of an ass kisser [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3652.58s)]
*  Like what do you think you're gonna hang out with these guys? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3654.78s)]
*  You know, you see gonna gonna [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3657.7999999999997s)]
*  People like the next time they have they rent a boat. They're gonna invite you like what? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3660.04s)]
*  Fuck right doing and so I know I'd never be that guy [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3665.12s)]
*  But you know kind of your point about like Philly or even the Durant part like I think I've I mean shit [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3668.7999999999997s)]
*  I didn't even really get on his case [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3675.0s)]
*  During the Golden State thing because I thought he wanted to get away from Westbrook and he wanted to play perfect basketball [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3677.12s)]
*  Yeah, he wanted to he wanted to like, you know back to the joy topic. He wanted to experience like [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3681.16s)]
*  Absolute pure basketball joy [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3686.44s)]
*  but when you have a four-year extension and you want marks and Nash and everybody fired before it even kicks in and then you [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3689.6400000000003s)]
*  Come back and play then you ask out and now you've put together a season [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3696.32s)]
*  I would say more so this year than last year [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3700.84s)]
*  But you I mean they got killed against Minnesota like that's when the Suns died and I was dumb enough to think that they weren't dead yet [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3702.76s)]
*  and they were already dead, but they just had another season and this season so [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3710.56s)]
*  What does Durant expect did he expect that people were gonna be like man? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3716.08s)]
*  He's still getting you like 29 30 every single night because if you look at the little stuff in between that doesn't always show it [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3719.56s)]
*  This is not a locked-in group. This is a group that seems to be really down on each other [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3726.1600000000003s)]
*  I thought the coach bud stuff admitting that he had told Booker to tone it down like I I just wondered [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3730.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like man. I wonder if that'll be I thought he was gonna get fired this weekend. I really did I [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3736.96s)]
*  Thought there was gonna be like a Don Nelson next thing. All right, let's take a quick break because I want to keep talking about this [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3741.6s)]
*  So one last thing on the and whether people are too critical or not [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3747.2s)]
*  I can't believe we spent this much time talking about but I do think it's interesting [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3751.04s)]
*  It seems like the rise of the X player podcasts and voices [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3757.56s)]
*  Has contributed to this whole when everybody's like work it we spent too much time comparing the past of the present [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3761.96s)]
*  And I think the social media piece of that too where you see all these videos and these breakdowns of this guy against this guy [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3768.2799999999997s)]
*  I just really hope that people realize and I like some of the X player stuff how unreliable they are as narrative narrators [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3775.4799999999996s)]
*  These are people that were playing the entire time. They might have opinions based on who they're against [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3784.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not like they spend a ton of time [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3789.2799999999997s)]
*  Thinking about different eras of the league and stars and comparing site and you'll just see stuff on the on these shows or pods [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3791.84s)]
*  Or on your on your social feed where you're like [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3798.4s)]
*  What are we doing? Like I just feel like the discourse [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3801.84s)]
*  big picture about [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3806.4s)]
*  Basketball as it relates to errors in the past is like the worst that's ever been [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3808.4s)]
*  And I don't think that's helping with some of this stuff. So you really disagreed with arenas's point. I think that's fair to say [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3812.7200000000003s)]
*  That was just one example [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3820.44s)]
*  Where I'm just like they just go back like go go read some of the books go read Phil Jackson's book about Kobe in [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3823.8s)]
*  2005 like you we just can't [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3831.08s)]
*  You can't just pretend stuff didn't happen [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3833.44s)]
*  You know, it's just the rate man. It's the rate of it and I do not understand like I couldn't believe the first time [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3836.2s)]
*  Coach told me he's like yeah players come in and check their mentions at halftime [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3841.56s)]
*  You didn't know that right and I'm thinking like what a ridiculous then I thought okay [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3845.4s)]
*  Well every single ESPN host as soon as you go to break does the exact same thing that that always I could never believe that [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3849.8s)]
*  What a terrible thing to do during a break at a show [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3856.44s)]
*  Right because maybe somebody else say I look ugly. Yeah, I've been guilty of it [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3860.12s)]
*  I used to do it and then I stopped because I realized you were coming back from break like talking to one person [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3865.28s)]
*  I [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3870.92s)]
*  Did it every one of us and it made all of us worst hosts because [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3876.84s)]
*  You know you're you were distracted you were talking to this one person you were focusing on the one negative because nobody was gonna be [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3886.1600000000003s)]
*  Like hey, you know what really good job making a point and a really solid conclusion [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3891.36s)]
*  No notes can't pick holes cuz I mean everybody's favorite hobby now [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3895.98s)]
*  Like even if I do a monologue on something for 10 15 minutes, usually 15 means it's too long [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3899.86s)]
*  Was like, oh, did you think about this? Like well, I could have done 30 left out. Yeah, you left right? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3904.9s)]
*  Yeah, like that is everyone's favorite hobby right now [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3909.6800000000003s)]
*  At least for what we do is that well, here's the point that you didn't make and then a lot of times it'll be so obvious [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3912.26s)]
*  It's like well [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3917.5s)]
*  I didn't even point that out because I don't even know why anybody would even bring it up and what we do is even fucking [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3918.1s)]
*  cool, so when I think about players [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3922.34s)]
*  Basically doing the exact same thing elected officials do the exact same thing [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3925.7000000000003s)]
*  I remember I got into it with Van Pelt that was like, why are you arguing with somebody right now? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3929.28s)]
*  You're broadcasting the fucking Masters. You were broadcasting the mayor on like the seventh hole and [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3932.46s)]
*  you know he I [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3938.6600000000003s)]
*  Realized like kind of no one can help themselves to different degrees [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3940.52s)]
*  And what I like about our age group is that we know what it was like before this and we certainly are in it deep [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3944.44s)]
*  Now for years and years, so we've experienced both of it. Imagine being a 20-something basketball player [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3949.38s)]
*  So like you're always going to be more impacted by the negativity the access to it the rate of it [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3953.8199999999997s)]
*  I think it's just fucks a lot of guys up [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3960.64s)]
*  So it's hard to tell players you're wrong about the negativity when it's all they've ever experienced [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3963.24s)]
*  They're not gonna do what you did because they weren't around when you did it [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3968.74s)]
*  They're not gonna go back and read Sports Illustrated articles from the 70s and go, you know what? I have greater perspective on this [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3971.18s)]
*  I don't have it too bad right now. Yeah, so I don't think anything LeBron said was necessarily [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3976.3599999999997s)]
*  I was talking about the X players. Yeah [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3981.52s)]
*  Yeah, the X player thing [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3985.28s)]
*  Although there's a good content lately [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3987.32s)]
*  Did you see the Vernon Maxwell on all the smoke talking about when Hakeem slapped him? That was one of the best three minutes [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3989.32s)]
*  I've spent all year that was so good. That clip was so good with those guys because [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3994.6800000000003s)]
*  Max respects them. Yeah, look that was a wild card and [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=3999.8s)]
*  Steven Jackson, I think people would say is a real one. So [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4004.56s)]
*  That was I'm totally with you I mean look if you want to talk X players [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4009.0s)]
*  I don't know if I trust anybody more than Jeff Teague right now [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4012.36s)]
*  Jeff Teague's been great. I really like breakout is like incredible [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4015.96s)]
*  I love Barnes and Captain Jack because I think when they talk about basketball in the history and how it relates now like I [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4020.84s)]
*  Actually believe in their opinions on it [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4028.24s)]
*  I've had them on the pod and we were arguing about Kobe versus Duncan who was the guy in the [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4030.16s)]
*  2000s the one the players they know they both were Kobe. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4035.2s)]
*  But they made compelling cases for it and it's like that's what's fun about basketball is arguing about different things [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4041.0s)]
*  I have never the first time I ever remember even thinking about who the face of the league was [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4046.04s)]
*  Was when MJ was retiring and we were kind of like what do we do now? [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4052.48s)]
*  And then it was a is it grand? What are four years? It went on is it Iverson? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4057.12s)]
*  But it was more like there was such a void [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4060.64s)]
*  NFL has never really had to deal with it because they always have two or three [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4064.04s)]
*  quarterbacks who are just there ready to roll right like that like Brady and Manning had it forever and [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4067.72s)]
*  Then Aaron Rodgers was just right there and then he moves in and then all of a sudden my home showed up and he's there [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4073.56s)]
*  And Joe burrow and they've they always have two or three dudes Josh Allen's in there now Lamar [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4078.62s)]
*  Maybe a couple other guys will pop in over the next couple years, but they always have the four to five the NBA [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4085.3599999999997s)]
*  There will be stretches [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4089.96s)]
*  We felt it in the mid-2000s was like, what do we do Kobe's on shitty teams? We thought it was gonna be him Shaxe getting old [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4091.36s)]
*  Duncan's not clicking with people, you know [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4098.92s)]
*  It's a Dwayne Wade Oh [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4102.76s)]
*  Dwayne Wade Oh six finals. Maybe it's Dwayne Wade and it was just a lot of that for [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4104.68s)]
*  basically all the way through until we ended up with LeBron and Kobe as kind of the [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4110.12s)]
*  the guys [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4114.84s)]
*  But I just think it's way more organic than us deciding it can be the face of the league if [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4116.24s)]
*  He kicks everybody's ass and wins the title and is clearly the best guy in the league. That's how it happens [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4122.88s)]
*  There's no other scenario [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4127.92s)]
*  Right, and then he's selling shoes and people talk about him and people like my mom know who he is [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4129.92s)]
*  That those are all the checkpoints you have to hit. Yeah, it doesn't happen without [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4135.12s)]
*  We don't decide doesn't know and there was that push to try to figure out who the post Jordan guy was [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4139.8s)]
*  And that void did go on forever [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4146.2s)]
*  It was the Kobe All-Star game where it just was gonna be too early for Kobe to take that on [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4147.76s)]
*  Yeah, after some of these other misses and Iverson didn't have the playoff success other than the finals run [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4152.84s)]
*  But that team just wasn't good enough for this to be like, oh, this is phase one of this sustainable thing with the Sixers [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4158.32s)]
*  It was kind of just yes [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4164.36s)]
*  Remarkable defensive run with an offense built around one guy just hopefully going crazy enough to get you some playoff wins [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4166.28s)]
*  so I [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4172.54s)]
*  think the lesson in that is that [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4173.74s)]
*  face never [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4176.099999999999s)]
*  like that face storyline never developed like that person did not present themselves and [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4177.82s)]
*  Whatever that void was it didn't mean the league was just gonna swallow itself up and cease to exist [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4182.26s)]
*  And I mean we can get in some of the rating stuff the popularity or whatever [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4186.98s)]
*  Which I there's one piece though different. There's a personality piece that I feel like [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4190.5s)]
*  You know when you see it, that's probably not gonna work as like the lead guy and I think Granhill was a good example [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4195.78s)]
*  Granhill was awesome [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4201.26s)]
*  But I never felt like he was there was like a sense of like almost like danger missing with him [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4202.58s)]
*  Right and then Duncan was the same thing Duncan was the best guy [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4207.620000000001s)]
*  I still have Duncan like sixth or seventh all I think I am seventh all time [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4211.26s)]
*  and I still think he was the best guy of the 2000s and [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4216.06s)]
*  Yet there was never a moment where people were like Duncan like they they ignored a lot of the stuff that he did [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4219.820000000001s)]
*  They focused on the wrong things and he just didn't care right and I think Tatum is a little bit like that now [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4225.18s)]
*  Where Tatum's never gonna be the best guy in the league. I don't think [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4231.26s)]
*  But he could be the most successful guy of this decade [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4235.54s)]
*  Right. He could be the guy when we leave the 2020s the guy that was the best guy in the most title teams [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4239.26s)]
*  but he doesn't have that sense of [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4245.3s)]
*  That that whiff of something that same thing with Duncan and Granhill [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4247.780000000001s)]
*  where it's just [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4252.3s)]
*  like you have to pull in everybody and there's something about Tatum that seems like [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4253.900000000001s)]
*  It doesn't click with people I don't know what it is I [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4258.86s)]
*  Thought during the broadcast today that was really interesting because it then turned to like another face-to-lead conversation [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4262.38s)]
*  and Doris was talking about like Tatum and [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4268.02s)]
*  Essentially saying, you know if you're that person and you should even have to [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4271.7s)]
*  Address it and I love that Breen was like, okay, but yeah was asked about it. Wow. There was also a game [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4276.9800000000005s)]
*  While there was also a game [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4284.58s)]
*  Where there was an ad that started with Tatum in a press conference to the commercial where the reporter again [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4286.82s)]
*  It's an actress going you're on top of the basketball world right now and you're like, okay [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4291.84s)]
*  He's got the title and he's the best player on a title team [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4295.9800000000005s)]
*  and I think you're rounding up a bit on like what's possible for him because I know we're gonna get to Cleveland and all this [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4298.9800000000005s)]
*  Other stuff, but I like that Breen was like, okay, but of all the superstars [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4304.4800000000005s)]
*  like this guy is incredibly polite and [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4310.9400000000005s)]
*  He also plays like every single game. So yeah, I think there's a place hard thing. Yeah [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4313.5s)]
*  There's a personality disconnect like Iverson was the coolest thing ever. All right. Yeah, it was but was really [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4320.74s)]
*  Polarizing when he was playing I think people like you and I were probably in the minority of like I fucking love Iverson [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4327.22s)]
*  I love a hearty place, but there's other people that [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4332.82s)]
*  You know, we're like, yeah [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4335.38s)]
*  Yeah, but he's kind of like this. He lost me a bit there towards the end of the Philly stuff because it's just [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4337.38s)]
*  I mean, it's on we're not awesome. Yeah, there's there's an approach to [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4343.86s)]
*  like if you're setting the tone as the best player in a team and then [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4349.38s)]
*  You're taking off and doing your own thing all the time [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4353.38s)]
*  It just can't be bothered like I don't know how that's good for the team and I don't know how that's good for yourself [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4355.96s)]
*  So once we had access to a little bit more of that stuff [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4360.82s)]
*  I think that's also something else too is like guys used to be able to hide [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4363.12s)]
*  Guys would be able to hide we didn't know what was going on with them [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4366.46s)]
*  We know what's going on with these guys literally every single fucking minute [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4369.78s)]
*  The relationship is so much more intimate and when it is that more intimate then you're much more likely to find things that you don't like [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4372.86s)]
*  About some of these dudes, but as far as like it is that everything though? It's not just the NBA [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4379.66s)]
*  I feel like that's every aspect of life is like that now think about how many people impressed you in the first five minutes and then [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4383.599999999999s)]
*  Ultimately let you down like if you think about your professional career the number of people that once you had more exposure to them [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4390.54s)]
*  I mean, I know that's the case for me [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4397.62s)]
*  So I don't speak for you, but then you were like, oh man, I had high hopes for this person [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4399.66s)]
*  That's why now seriously if somebody nails it with me in the first five to ten minutes. I'm more worried [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4404.42s)]
*  You're suspicious [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4412.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like you were so good in the first five to ten minutes. I thought now I'm like what's wrong with this person? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4413.42s)]
*  Well, the the cult concept of celebrity and how fast people can get it and then how fast they can lose it [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4419.46s)]
*  I feel like that process has definitely been sped up [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4425.78s)]
*  I say it with like my daughter when I'm always I'm always asking her like what are you? What are you watching? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4427.94s)]
*  Who do you care about? What's your favorite podcast? What's your favorite video podcast? And it always seems to change [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4432.3s)]
*  What is her favorite podcast every I think it was the cancelled podcast, but I think now they had some shit [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4437.98s)]
*  What's interesting is it's like the same cycle over and over again where she she really likes somebody and then like why don't you listen? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4443.78s)]
*  That podcast anymore. Oh, they had a meltdown. Oh [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4450.62s)]
*  One of the co-hosts got cancelled. Oh, they ended up turning on each other [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4453.82s)]
*  And it's just like the internet just like hyper [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4458.5s)]
*  Hypercharges all of these kind of rises and falls with all these different social media characters [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4462.34s)]
*  It's hard to keep up with basketball. You have the same rise and fall stuff, but the guys are making 50 million dollars a year [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4467.5s)]
*  That's like Kevin Durant's on the top of the world in [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4473.22s)]
*  2018 and then he's down and then he's up and then he's down then he goes to Phoenix. It's gonna be great now [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4476.26s)]
*  He's down. Oh my god, they're trading him now is gonna maybe gets traded as st. Antonio in July. It's like oh [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4481.94s)]
*  Kevin Durant can teach when Bignama how to win and it's just like a fucking roller coaster [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4488.099999999999s)]
*  And maybe that's what LeBron was talking about [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4492.5s)]
*  That the the scrutiny and the roller coaster ride of all this is really hard and if you're the face [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4494.82s)]
*  I'm sure it's a bigger roller coaster. I [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4500.139999999999s)]
*  Can't imagine though not wanting to be the face. How could you be a pro athlete? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4503.139999999999s)]
*  Well, that's where it gets that's where it's hard to take it seriously where it's like so you didn't want this the whole time [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4507.5s)]
*  When you're doing Nike ads in 2003 [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4512.419999999999s)]
*  You did a special to change teams and so you you didn't want you weren't excited for this [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4515.299999999999s)]
*  I was not surprised by that part of the quote, but I whatever I just [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4520.58s)]
*  Can't it though he that he definitely he has such a big platform now when he talks about stuff candidly [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4526.299999999999s)]
*  It really does have reactions that last two to three days. Sometimes he does make people think [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4531.78s)]
*  I think that [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4536.860000000001s)]
*  You know the mind the game pod about some of the dialogue about that about we had to do this pod to save basketball discourse [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4538.54s)]
*  I take stuff like that probably a little bit personally because he's basically I don't know [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4545.26s)]
*  We spent like going back to Graylin in the ring or we've we've tried to elevate discussion and pods and writing and all this stuff [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4549.92s)]
*  And I think a lot of people have so when somebody's saying nothing's elevated you're kind of like well, I mean we're trying [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4555.9400000000005s)]
*  you know, I [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4564.06s)]
*  Know that I care a lot about what we talk about on this what I've talked about on my pods and the shows in the [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4565.78s)]
*  Past I mean I really I mean I really cared about putting a lot of thought into what my opinions were gonna be [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4571.98s)]
*  And yet I always knew like oh, you don't like do you know what the help rules are? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4579.54s)]
*  Do you know what all the terminology is? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4585.82s)]
*  Second a bit. Yeah. Well, no that kind of stuff [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4588.7s)]
*  I used to really then I realized it's like you're spending way too much time on this [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4591.58s)]
*  Like I would I would study the CBA pretty religiously because I wanted to have it like down and I used to have it down [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4594.78s)]
*  And now I'm like, I think I'll be okay [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4600.66s)]
*  Remember we did that one podcast right after they changed the CBA and both of us were so freaked out and we were doing it [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4602.42s)]
*  It was like we were like trying to take a boat and cross the Pacific Ocean [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4608.3s)]
*  We're like, hey, but then there's this other we were like so nervous. We didn't understand it [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4612.219999999999s)]
*  yeah, because I I felt like you know, there's always the like unintended consequences thing that [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4617.94s)]
*  It's just hard to factor in I was thinking about this the other day like the timeout before three minutes [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4623.58s)]
*  To go where you lose the timeout because it was like hey, here's silver and the competition committee [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4628.14s)]
*  I don't even know if that's what they call it's what the NFL does [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4633.22s)]
*  But they decided yeah, there's too many timeouts at the end of games like let's take a timeout away from them [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4635.12s)]
*  Okay, what's happening? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4640.740000000001s)]
*  Everybody just calls it now so you could come out of commercial break one possession that the other team looks up and goes [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4642.1s)]
*  Oh, we're gonna lose this timeout anyway. Yeah, so let's make sure we take it now [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4647.46s)]
*  And so we're not getting any time back because the unintended consequence was that you ended up with coaches just going [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4651.62s)]
*  I'll take it before I lose it. So now my solution be just give them one less timeout [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4658.76s)]
*  And then you'll be fine and back to the original plan [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4663.98s)]
*  Anyway, the reason I use that as an example is that whenever you're on the fly trying to read a CBA and the highlights [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4665.98s)]
*  From the whole thing like we were kind of going [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4671.22s)]
*  This feels like a hard cap and I was almost scared a little bit to go [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4673.86s)]
*  Is it a hard cap like is is this going to be a hard cap? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4679.0199999999995s)]
*  But yeah back to the original thing like look man. I I do put a lot of thought into this I [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4684.099999999999s)]
*  Always wondered I could get to an age where I'd be like you think at this age. You'll just go like fuck it [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4690.42s)]
*  Yeah, I watch I watched the fourth quarter like I'm good. I haven't read anything like I'm definitely ways to cheat [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4695.7s)]
*  yeah, right and then I think about the guys that played and I think about the coaches and [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4702.66s)]
*  A lot of the people that work in our industry, you know, whether it's you know, it's it's not perfect parallel to it [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4707.339999999999s)]
*  But there's so many players that I'll listen to and go. Okay. Wait, you have a problem with me and I didn't play [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4713.299999999999s)]
*  Like have you heard your shit? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4719.179999999999s)]
*  Have you heard how dumb all your arguments? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4721.58s)]
*  I mean, there's one person in particular I'm thinking of right now [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4723.96s)]
*  like if I really wanted to do a 10-minute monologue destroying this person's takes and [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4726.0199999999995s)]
*  How fucked they are and I don't know what the motives are behind him [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4729.86s)]
*  But like I could but I really don't want to get no fight with anybody about that kind of stuff [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4733.44s)]
*  But that's it almost brings me back [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4738.16s)]
*  It's it's like being a screenwriter where you get really discouraged and you're like, holy shit. They greenlit that let's open up the laptop [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4739.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know I don't know if we have the answer I'm just my point is I think the NBA has always had [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4751.16s)]
*  More than a twinge of negativity to it and I think it has to do with the personalities [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4759.16s)]
*  And the experience of going to games and having those guys right in front of you and the fact that there's a connection [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4763.44s)]
*  That's just different [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4768.28s)]
*  Baseball used to have it. I think the net has really hurt [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4769.5199999999995s)]
*  I know why they have it I get all the reasons but [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4772.96s)]
*  The net is is is just tough. You think the net has ruined baseball. I don't saying it's ruined baseball. I think it's tough. I [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4776.12s)]
*  Think it's how I even notice [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4784.599999999999s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Oh man. I used to love [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4787.599999999999s)]
*  The energy of like this might be the pitch where a foul ball comes over here or you like being on your toes [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4791.400000000001s)]
*  Ah loved it. Nobody's on their toes anymore in baseball middle linebacker [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4797.200000000001s)]
*  People are just crossing the highway not worried about getting hit by a car and when they go to a baseball game now [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4802.4400000000005s)]
*  You just be on your phone for 20 minutes [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4807.080000000001s)]
*  You feel the energy around it? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4809.96s)]
*  It's definitely different [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4812.8s)]
*  Let's take one more break and then we got to talk about the Celtics weekend [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4814.96s)]
*  So I'm gonna give you biggest red flags for every contender just quickly you tell me if you agree I didn't prep you for this [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4818.96s)]
*  Cleveland [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4826.64s)]
*  Lack of playoff experience. I would go which just jumps to your head immediately [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4827.76s)]
*  Which is the only thing that's the only thing I love them. I absolutely love that because I want to come back, right? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4832.64s)]
*  Boston hunger health and mileage would be my three just the mileage on the guys from the hundred game season last year [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4838.88s)]
*  The fact that they won last year a team like Cleveland's just gonna be a whiff hunger and [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4845.16s)]
*  The health of poor Zingas and Drew I think would be the three things that worried me [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4850.08s)]
*  Yeah, the only thing I would say and it's not fair and it's probably because I watch them too much [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4856.76s)]
*  But I think they get almost to hunt happy. Yeah [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4861.68s)]
*  Where everything's happening 40 feet from the basket? Oh, we got this [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4866.52s)]
*  You know I get it expose the weakness find the bad matchup you have these two incredible on-ball wings [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4871.0s)]
*  You have a third guy and Derek why do you can do some of that stuff, too? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4877.52s)]
*  I mean they are when it is clicking on offense. I mean the offensive numbers are outrageous or terrific [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4880.400000000001s)]
*  So who am I to sit here? I criticize any of this stuff. I criticized some of it last year [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4884.860000000001s)]
*  It did not matter but they can get so hunt happy that I wonder in the way basketball is connected [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4888.38s)]
*  That have other players just watching somebody hunt the entire time [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4895.4800000000005s)]
*  At least they take turns with it. Some teams will just have their main ball handler hunt the entire time [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4899.26s)]
*  And it's it's a minor thing that I noticed but I'm probably too [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4903.34s)]
*  Critical of it because there's no offensive number that tells you. Oh, yeah, like oh, I like the term hunt happy [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4907.58s)]
*  Congratulations on that [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4915.7s)]
*  Here's here's I agree with you. By the way [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4917.18s)]
*  I wish they would just run plays every once a while to mix it up [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4919.9800000000005s)]
*  Like just every once in a while just put tatum at the foul line and give him a like a dirt the whiskey post up [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4923.34s)]
*  Just so it's not the same thing over and over again where we're just hunting guys hunting guys something guys because I do think [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4928.5s)]
*  The defenses can get in the rhythm of knowing it's coming and figuring out tricks. So [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4933.66s)]
*  Denver [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4940.18s)]
*  And we'll talk about that game in a second, but they just have no room for error at all [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4941.58s)]
*  If they're not making threes it gets tough [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4946.22s)]
*  If anyone if Gordon's out or Murray's hurt or even Brown's hurt it gets super tough for them [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4948.66s)]
*  if [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4956.58s)]
*  Westbrook just sucks [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4958.42s)]
*  It's almost like they can't they can't fight it and it's just I think they could win three straight rounds [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4960.14s)]
*  I think they could go four and three and three straight playoff series or four and two [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4965.900000000001s)]
*  But it's not gonna be a team that's like ripping through the playoffs. There's just too many ways [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4970.1s)]
*  It seems like it go wrong game to game [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4974.06s)]
*  Would be my red flag [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4976.780000000001s)]
*  They have lineups that they run out there where and maybe it's a regular season thing look no Aaron Gordon today [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4979.9400000000005s)]
*  Who's their best defensive player and has been shooting it well from three? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4987.78s)]
*  But he's still somebody that I think teams are going to test [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4992.219999999999s)]
*  But you know, so it's not entirely fair because Gordon's missed a couple games here [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=4997.5s)]
*  But they had a lineup where it was Michael Porter jr. Surrounded by Westbrook Brown who was great today [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5000.66s)]
*  But I mean, what was his shot total like if you go into a game 22, he took 22 shots [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5005.58s)]
*  So if you're sitting there prepping out what you want to do against Denver, you're like, hey if Christian Brown takes 22 shots [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5010.78s)]
*  It's probably a win for us today, right? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5015.1s)]
*  So it's Michael Porter jr. Who I think is you know, if you dig into his advanced stuff [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5016.780000000001s)]
*  He's not the same guy that he was the first couple years on the scene even though [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5021.26s)]
*  Defensively he was such a disaster then the Malone didn't really even trust him [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5025.740000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's a plus but I think he's a total coin toss guy if he had 21 or he had three [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5029.5s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. I also think he plays a little soft but back to this lineup [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5034.580000000001s)]
*  So it's Porter jr. Westbrook Brown Deandre Jordan and Strother [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5040.06s)]
*  When you're looking at some of the three-point shooting against these guys like Westbrook's gonna be open and when he hit his first three [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5045.34s)]
*  I thought that was a bad sign for Denver with this stuff. You can also see Westbrook decide he's not comfortable shooting [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5050.820000000001s)]
*  You can also see Westbrook [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5057.02s)]
*  You know [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5058.42s)]
*  It's great that he's probably understood his role better here than a lot of the other places as he's tried to become a role [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5059.06s)]
*  Player like I'd say what this is stop three as a role player because Washington he still was clearly the guy [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5064.740000000001s)]
*  You'll see him be in a hurry to force it back to Yelkich [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5069.860000000001s)]
*  Which is showing him being deferential away that we weren't used to with so many of the prime Westbrook years [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5072.700000000001s)]
*  But I think you can also mess them up a little bit [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5077.54s)]
*  So whether it was the Lakers matchup or the Boston matchup today again without Gordon is an entirely fair. I [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5079.860000000001s)]
*  Have I know you weren't expecting this long so I'm not gonna go this long on the other ones [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5085.46s)]
*  But I've talked about it being four teams because of the respect for Yelkich and Denver was fourth in the fan duel title odds [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5089.860000000001s)]
*  It's it's those three and Denver's in like a [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5096.9s)]
*  Sliver tier by themselves because I just don't think they're as good as Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City Cleveland or Boston [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5100.54s)]
*  And I don't see how they are going to be as good as those three teams [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5107.14s)]
*  I have them fourth as well, but I also feel the Yelkich piece [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5109.94s)]
*  When we get to a playoff where they just are playing the same team for two straight weeks. I [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5114.74s)]
*  Think that's good for them [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5120.66s)]
*  See the spacing stuff I know well that it's alarming the open threes today [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5122.86s)]
*  How many just wide open threes they took compared to they even shoot 40%? They were two for 11 on their first [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5127.94s)]
*  11 wide open threes. Yeah, that's what that's what would scare me if I'm them on the game [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5135.26s)]
*  They got it back to 34% but they're they're last in the NBA and points from the three [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5140.18s)]
*  So their percentage points however many they score a game [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5146.099999999999s)]
*  They have the last or the lowest total of points via the three-pointer of anyone and so then they come to a game like today [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5148.58s)]
*  like that was gonna be really weird if Boston had blown this because [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5155.26s)]
*  Approach wise. Hey, here's the plan. Here's what we want to have happen [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5159.0599999999995s)]
*  It's exactly what you would hope to do to Denver. But yeah, great. You're and if I'm Denver, I feel great [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5162.46s)]
*  It was a one possession game. I didn't have Gordon who's my third most important guy and [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5168.18s)]
*  I still from Denver and I know I can be in crunch time in the playoffs with the Oak edge and Porter and Gordon and [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5173.98s)]
*  Murray and Brown I still feel really good about where I'm at if I could just get in the fourth quarters with those five guys [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5181.379999999999s)]
*  Not get crushed on those Yoke edge minutes [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5188.179999999999s)]
*  But you know even like something like Torrey Craig feels like they could it could have helped them [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5190.299999999999s)]
*  I kind of like this Celtics sneaking out the Torrey Craig move. I just Denver doesn't have enough guys. I trust [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5194.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, see red flag just the second score lack of experience thing [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5200.94s)]
*  just ultimately if they're down four on the road in a really big playoff game and a [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5206.66s)]
*  team is just [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5212.22s)]
*  swarming Shay and double teaming them like [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5213.82s)]
*  Who's stepping up? I just want to see it. I'm not I'm not down on it, but we just haven't seen it [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5216.58s)]
*  It's very similar to the Celtics last year. Just want to see what happens with that [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5222.34s)]
*  It'll be interesting if Shay gets his points [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5226.26s)]
*  Jalen Williams gets his points [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5229.1s)]
*  Chat as you'd expect taking a little time [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5231.22s)]
*  I thought he was so great in that Brooklyn game when they gave up what 76 points to the nets of all teams [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5233.86s)]
*  Yeah, this kind of defense this historic differential defense based on the league averages [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5238.66s)]
*  But it might just be does Isaiah Joe door [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5243.3s)]
*  Caruso Aaron Wiggins [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5247.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean he's I've joked about him being one of my favorite players [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5248.46s)]
*  But as far as like a roll guy and stepping up and then what he did in February [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5251.22s)]
*  I mean every time I watch a Thunder game [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5254.78s)]
*  I'm always like and do you favorite favorite bench guys right now want to do a team because my favorite bench guys Ty Jerome [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5256.82s)]
*  Just hands down Ty Jerome comes in and the score changes immediately. He does nine. Thanks. I love Ty Jerome [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5263.18s)]
*  I think he's gonna I I genuinely think he's gonna make like 60 million dollars a summer [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5269.48s)]
*  I'm pretty good at I too am fond of Ty Jerome. We have him on the pod coming up this week, by the way [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5275.22s)]
*  Oh nice. I'm a huge joining on Thursday. Great [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5280.78s)]
*  I'm a huge fan. I [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5284.5s)]
*  Love when he comes in he it's exactly he's like the most pure bench guy in the league comes in [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5286.58s)]
*  It's gonna play his eight nine minutes. However long it is. He's gonna affect the game. He's gonna make a shot [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5291.74s)]
*  He's gonna have energy [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5296.18s)]
*  And in that Friday night south the game, I was like fuck [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5297.82s)]
*  I I hope they don't close with Ty Jerome because he's Ty Jerome is a problem [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5300.34s)]
*  By the way Wiggins is up there for me as a favorite bench guy, too [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5305.54s)]
*  There was a moment when Ty Jerome was playing and trying to figure out where his basketball life was gonna go [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5308.88s)]
*  Van Gundy was on the broadcast and this is when I knew I mean anybody that watched him in college [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5314.72s)]
*  He just he's very different in that he the play is open. There are options open on his plays [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5319.160000000001s)]
*  That are longer if that makes sense [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5328.320000000001s)]
*  Like it's almost like a quarterback watching routes develop and he finds a way to give the receivers the extra beat to do whatever [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5330.4800000000005s)]
*  They need to do so that you're you're still defending more shit than you want to defend with Jerome [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5337.68s)]
*  And that's why he screws up so many of these defenses because you're like there's no way this is gonna work [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5342.14s)]
*  And it's a lot of that Nash wrong foot thing or it's the takeoff to pass where guys started remember [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5346.4800000000005s)]
*  Like almost running out of the way of Nash's drives [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5352.52s)]
*  It actually opened up things for Nash because people were closing out and so freaked about his passing skills [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5355.72s)]
*  And Jerome has these runners where everything is kind of wrong and then you don't really know what's supposed to happen [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5360.400000000001s)]
*  anyway, then Gunny was on a broadcast and [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5364.62s)]
*  It was almost like your grandfather watching Christina Hendricks on an episode of Mad Men for the first time [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5367.280000000001s)]
*  like just this [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5375.12s)]
*  Erotic [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5378.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah lately like the way Van Gundy talked about Ty Jerome's game [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5379.52s)]
*  It was it was like he needed a breath like he needed a moment [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5383.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and they say makes it makes all the sense of the world like Cleveland when they came back [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5387.4800000000005s)]
*  What was really interesting about their game? They went to ten guys [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5392.42s)]
*  I think 14 minutes into the game. Yeah, they were at ten guys and their friend in that game you're talking about right there [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5395.28s)]
*  Depending maybe maybe you take a coral off the table shot selection some of the stuff. Let's say nine [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5403.32s)]
*  Nine of the guys for Cleveland now are really good. Yeah [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5409.5199999999995s)]
*  Ty Jerome Wiggins [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5415.36s)]
*  I'm trying to think who else are my favorites. I still enjoy Quentin Grimes. I wish he was on a good team [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5419.16s)]
*  a bunch of the Detroit guys [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5425.759999999999s)]
*  They play a million dudes. Yeah playing a lot [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5428.599999999999s)]
*  I like Detroit brings their guys in and they're all playing really hard and they're ready to rough people up again fights [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5431.679999999999s)]
*  red flag [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5438.24s)]
*  Set the tone Lakers is easy rim protection and [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5439.599999999999s)]
*  Defending at the other team's point guard if it's somebody who can get to the rim [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5443.719999999999s)]
*  I think it's gonna be a problem for them that they could figure it out and then Golden State turnovers and ball handling [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5447.0s)]
*  They they still have the dumbest turnovers doesn't matter who's on the team. They're just gonna have dumb turnovers [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5453.219999999999s)]
*  They're gonna have really bad turnovers in crunch time [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5458.179999999999s)]
*  I think it's aging Steve Kerr and like dog years watching I think it's even when they were arguably the greatest team [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5460.259999999999s)]
*  They still ever seen yeah, they turn the ball over. It's the fatal flaw for Steph [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5466.82s)]
*  They play better defense than everybody to on top of being unguardable. So and then the last red flag Memphis [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5470.339999999999s)]
*  I know you want to do some Memphis stuff really quick and then we'll circle back to the Friday Sunday [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5476.5s)]
*  Seltz games if there's anything left, but I the job not being able to make [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5481.24s)]
*  Outside shots doesn't seem like it and how everything is so dependent on him just getting to the rim [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5485.72s)]
*  I just feel like it's gonna be easy to stop in a playoff series and it for me lowers their ceiling [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5490.5199999999995s)]
*  I've watched him a lot [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5497.2s)]
*  The last I don't know ten plus days [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5499.44s)]
*  That watched the Clippers [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5503.48s)]
*  Loss I watched the Phoenix win I watched the Phoenix win an overtime the Knicks loss which could have gone either way [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5505.44s)]
*  And they lose the San Antonio, but John didn't play last night, right? I don't think our Bain played [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5512.16s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, cuz Bain was in a sick sick hoodie [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5517.599999999999s)]
*  I want to be fair about Memphis, you know [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5520.96s)]
*  Cuz I think that the most dismissive thing you could say is hey [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5523.719999999999s)]
*  They've never done shit because I hear it a lot [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5526.62s)]
*  Like if I talked to teams like hey, who do you like? Who do you not? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5528.839999999999s)]
*  Like what would you think about this matchup? Whatever? There's a lot of never done shit [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5531.339999999999s)]
*  About a million different teams because you know what? It's really hard to do win [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5535.9800000000005s)]
*  It's hard to actually do shit like you could even I don't even know how win-horse [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5539.360000000001s)]
*  Like again, it's not a criticism a win-horse [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5544.58s)]
*  But I was a little shocked at how often like he was talking about how [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5546.46s)]
*  Disrespected the Thunder were whereas once they get into the playoffs that a lot of this stuff isn't gonna work [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5550.1s)]
*  And that one I don't quite understand [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5555.02s)]
*  I don't think it's even fair to judge the Thunder is some finished product. Did he say that about this season's thunder? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5556.66s)]
*  He said about I mean do I have to bring up the quote because it's I brought it up with later [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5562.139999999999s)]
*  I'm just surprised. Yeah, I brought it up with Slater this week [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5566.3s)]
*  Where he he was basically saying like man, it's not like he's pulling the entire league, but it's like a player thing [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5569.26s)]
*  There's just players that look at the Thunder look at their regular season success now last year you could point to and go [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5574.94s)]
*  Hey, look at their health and look at their available guys [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5579.66s)]
*  Like they had basically played Sacramento had one of those seasons where it's like, okay [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5582.26s)]
*  You basically ceiling doubt though this entire time. You tend to attend [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5586.3s)]
*  The your luck factor, I don't understand like why wouldn't shade she's just gonna be as good [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5589.86s)]
*  Maybe he has a this happened a Boston last year though [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5594.94s)]
*  What do you mean? There's just this weird with that when you say like around the league. There's a [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5598.42s)]
*  Feeling like there's not a total respect. This was the Boston situation last year [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5603.82s)]
*  So what yeah, which team has not won that people were like, hey that team's gonna get it done [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5607.58s)]
*  well, this is never happened this circles back to the Cleveland piece of it because I [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5613.78s)]
*  Think Cleveland is [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5619.26s)]
*  Fucking terrifying. I've said this to you. Are you ready to pick them over Boston in a series? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5621.82s)]
*  I want to see who's healthy on the Boston side. Okay, look, let's just [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5627.32s)]
*  The head right now, like what do I think's gonna happen? I think it's gonna be really hard to win a game seven in Cleveland [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5631.7s)]
*  I think Mitchell [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5637.0599999999995s)]
*  Could not be less afraid of the Boston Celtics and he's been this way for most of the decade. He loves playing them [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5639.94s)]
*  They have two awesome guards one who didn't play Friday and they have length with with swings and they can't stop him [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5646.66s)]
*  And if it gets to a situation where there's a couple big playoff games in a series [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5653.860000000001s)]
*  He's gonna think he can beat whoever the best Boston guy is and he did it on Friday night [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5658.3s)]
*  He was the best guy on the floor in the second half [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5662.38s)]
*  They have length moblies better [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5665.54s)]
*  Mobly was awesome in that fourth quarter on Friday. Get you don't say did Tuesday sat Alan to close [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5667.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well that but there was no porzingis no drew [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5673.76s)]
*  So it's it's hard to overreact one way or the other but the Mitchell piece and their bench, which is real [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5677.12s)]
*  Hunter who has always done pretty well against the cell to s size who can at least make guys think and they don't have to play [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5682.8s)]
*  A Coro. I think Cleveland's really good and you know what my other reason is they only have ten losses. It's March 2nd [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5689.1s)]
*  Cleveland's good. They should be the favorite and Boston is the favorite on [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5696.12s)]
*  Fandle their minus 150 Cleveland's plus 270. I think Boston could be Cleveland [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5700.66s)]
*  Yeah, but think about that sentence. Like did you think you would be saying that? I think Boston could be Cleveland [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5706.3s)]
*  I think they could right now, but Boston was the prohibitive favorites and [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5712.66s)]
*  The odds have not caught up to Cleveland yet. They're plus 270 and they're gonna have home court advantage in [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5716.820000000001s)]
*  Any Boston series? That's a real thing [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5722.62s)]
*  I [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5725.38s)]
*  Like the way they match up against okay see too. There's some Garland stuff with them that Boston [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5727.38s)]
*  They really went after it in the Friday game where they're like, we're just gonna attack them. We're gonna bully him [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5731.9400000000005s)]
*  We're gonna use our wings and and their refs were awful [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5735.900000000001s)]
*  My dad was the most upset about the refs that he's been in two years coming home [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5739.74s)]
*  Could not believe Tatum at five free throws [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5744.22s)]
*  Look, you can excuse that game any way you want. That was an awesome win for Cleveland [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5747.34s)]
*  That was an awesome win for Cleveland [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5751.1s)]
*  Like they had to fall down like they did to have Tatum do they get the fuck out of here thing and then for them to [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5753.1s)]
*  Come back and them knowing that [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5757.860000000001s)]
*  Mitchell might be the best guy in the series if you're just talking about who can score in a fourth quarter on both sides [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5760.700000000001s)]
*  So if I'm Cleveland, I'm like delighted by how the seasons going [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5766.3s)]
*  So Mitchell this season in three games against Boston's average in 36 7 and 4 on [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5769.860000000001s)]
*  50 and 38 [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5775.780000000001s)]
*  Better [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5777.860000000001s)]
*  Splits it's getting all the shots he wants he gets the threes he wants to get some matchups [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5780.58s)]
*  he wants he gets the runners he wants he can get to the rim and [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5784.9s)]
*  This will be like you did that drew holiday extension, right? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5789.259999999999s)]
*  You did it to make him feel good about last season heading in the playoffs [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5792.58s)]
*  But ultimately you're trying to go back to back and that's a lot of money for a guy [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5795.82s)]
*  I was 34 who's got now like a fucked up finger [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5799.9s)]
*  But this is that's gonna be the series for drew holiday that Mitchell series what he can do against Mitchell [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5802.179999999999s)]
*  Will be the entire contract because they I don't think anyone else white doesn't seem like he can get a handle on him and [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5809.08s)]
*  They're just putting everybody else in switches and it's gonna have to be holiday. I think first of all, he's just that good [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5817.0s)]
*  Okay, like the best version of him [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5823.240000000001s)]
*  He also rejects the screen in that Dwayne Wade way where I think when you're really good at that [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5825.22s)]
*  Cuz I just don't know that there's enough like guys that [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5831.34s)]
*  Understand when you turn the screen down and you go the other way [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5834.4800000000005s)]
*  He also splits it, you know again, I'm not trying to compare him to Kobe because Kobe would split screens in ways [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5837.44s)]
*  You were just like, oh my god [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5841.759999999999s)]
*  It's mid-2000s Wade with three-point range is what he reminds me of because he can get he can get to the basket [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5842.839999999999s)]
*  He can get in the paint [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5848.839999999999s)]
*  but he also has this three-point shot that we'd never had and [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5849.799999999999s)]
*  He's just so athletic and it just who is the right guy to guard him when he's feeling it [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5853.32s)]
*  Well, it's probably not Hauser [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5858.0599999999995s)]
*  Hauser holds up like that was one of the things that I was looking at the last few days with Boston were [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5860.5599999999995s)]
*  You okay every one of these Hauser minutes or every one of these curl handoffs where you're getting cornet trying to figure out [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5865.5199999999995s)]
*  Which side of the paint he's gonna try to contest a shot on like those are Przingus and Drew minutes [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5871.639999999999s)]
*  So even if Drew doesn't end up on him, you're now switching into whatever version of this was and now pre [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5877.04s)]
*  Deandre Hunter, I didn't care what Mitchell did [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5883.24s)]
*  I didn't care about what the regular season stuff and again, it had gone Boston's way [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5886.36s)]
*  So you could at least point to that as evidence [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5889.68s)]
*  But there was always a bad matchup waiting for Cleveland whether it was finding Garland or strews having to start on [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5893.12s)]
*  Jaylen Brown or you know Allen is on Tatum. They clearly like [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5900.5199999999995s)]
*  Bringing Allen all the way out away from the rim [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5905.32s)]
*  And then if the Mobley lineup is out there with Allen trying to keep him pinned to three-point shooter [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5908.16s)]
*  So like basically you can't have Allen or Mobley ever freelance to the rim [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5912.76s)]
*  And I actually think in the matchups where Tatum had Allen like he did a really good job with it [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5915.88s)]
*  Because if he wasn't gonna be able to finish at the rim [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5920.08s)]
*  He kind of knew and he had a massive game there, but that was one of the best Tatum games he's ever had [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5921.76s)]
*  He was like he was just the matchups and spots. He was picking. I thought he was incredible in that game [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5927.92s)]
*  But now that they have these hunter minutes and they closed with Mobley [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5934.2s)]
*  Hunter and then the guards because Garland played and had his moments even though he's being hunted and then you have so Cleveland now has [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5939.12s)]
*  put together [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5946.14s)]
*  Spacing options and the hunter part of it even though it's expensive. I love that they did this because [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5947.4s)]
*  Now it's like look nobody's stopping Tatum necessarily, but at least you have somebody size-wise who has a defensive thing to him [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5952.839999999999s)]
*  It's a chore to score against him and he can shoot threes. Look the point is it's even without Przingus and Drew in there [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5960.5599999999995s)]
*  Maybe it feels like a mistake [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5966.08s)]
*  Cleveland's the favorite I [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5968.839999999999s)]
*  agree with him I [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5970.719999999999s)]
*  Couldn't believe the odds I couldn't believe they were plus 270 with home court [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5972.4s)]
*  I was stunned that thing you mentioned 25 3 and then you on the road [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5976.44s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned the owl and not playing in crunch time because I actually thought there was a chance they were gonna bench [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5982.4s)]
*  Garland and crunch time and play Ty Jerome because he was so good in that game [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5987.24s)]
*  They have different lineups they can do right then go a little smaller. They go a little bigger [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5990.4s)]
*  They can go big in their backcourt if they feel like Garland is too much of a defensive liability and Mitchell's feeling it [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=5994.94s)]
*  They can just yank them [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6000.379999999999s)]
*  and I think Atkinson has a real feel for what the team is but [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6002.679999999999s)]
*  And he has all these different options [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6007.0s)]
*  I guess I just don't like the default and I'm guilty of it too. Like we have a really hard time with new [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6008.78s)]
*  It's hard to be ahead of everybody going, you know what? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6012.48s)]
*  Like but if I were to listen to somebody like Cleveland hasn't done it Boston has and that be the reason that's not a reason [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6017.08s)]
*  It's ignoring a lot of basketball stuff. There's not a reason now [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6023.839999999999s)]
*  The one thread I was on was convinced that Joe Maz [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6028.16s)]
*  Didn't play Tory Craig in that fourth quarter and did all that Hauser stuff because he didn't care about the game because they're the two-seed anyway [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6032.4s)]
*  He wanted Cleveland because Joe Maz's [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6038.2s)]
*  You know, he he looks at things completely different everybody else, but he's like I don't really care about this game [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6040.84s)]
*  I'm gonna try this and see if it works. It doesn't work. I just won't do it if we're actually in a playoff series [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6045.32s)]
*  the poor Zingas piece I think is still gonna be a [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6051.36s)]
*  Genuine problem for the Cavs if he's healthy [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6054.68s)]
*  That's the matchup because the other thing is he allows when Mitchell's going to the basket now [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6057.320000000001s)]
*  There's somebody coming over at their hand up [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6062.46s)]
*  Who's just a little bit of a different person to contend with and if they want to go double big you you still have to respect [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6064.08s)]
*  You obviously have to respect for Zingas that you feel like Boston has the stretch options and we might be both making mistake [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6070.68s)]
*  Declaring Cleveland the favor right now. The whole point is being out [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6076.6s)]
*  But I just think they're that good man if we're doing percentages and it's we're going to hundred percent at hundred percent percentages [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6079.5s)]
*  Boston Cleveland, that's it. I would say it's like you love when I do this. I would say it's like I'm writing it down [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6086.74s)]
*  I got my pen. I would say it's 55 45 Cleveland in my mind [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6093.06s)]
*  I think there's more outcomes when Cleveland beats Boston and vice versa [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6096.66s)]
*  And I think that game seven in Cleveland really matters and everyone always discounts this shit and we've had some upsets [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6100.34s)]
*  We had Minnesota going to Denver and beat them in a game seven. I know there's games where that happens, but [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6106.54s)]
*  Mitchell this might be like a Mitchell year. I wouldn't rule it out and it's also he's an interesting MVP guy now because [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6114.14s)]
*  It's obviously Shane Joker as the top two and I think Tatum's third [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6120.86s)]
*  But if Cleveland ends up like 67 and 15 with all the stuff [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6124.94s)]
*  you almost have to [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6130.02s)]
*  Have a cab in the top. It'd be weird for them not to have someone in the top three [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6131.9800000000005s)]
*  so it would and it's clearly Mitchell but [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6136.5s)]
*  Amazing year by him kudos to him. I was a little iffy on him last year with [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6139.5s)]
*  Some of the decision-making this year I'm not well they went to seven games at Orlando [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6145.06s)]
*  Yeah [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6149.54s)]
*  You know an Orlando who if you really want to have a bad time watch them on offense this season [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6150.06s)]
*  it's funny too because [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6156.58s)]
*  Cleveland ran the zone where they had Ty Jerome and Sam Merrill at the top of the zone and [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6158.02s)]
*  You're looking at Orlando's options [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6162.78s)]
*  I mean like I know with the zone it can like mess you up a little bit and also screws up [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6165.0199999999995s)]
*  Orlando's offense that their top two usage guys are 30% each from three in Palo and France [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6168.42s)]
*  So that's gonna put a dent in your plans [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6174.82s)]
*  But I was watching this going how can you guys not figure out a way to attack? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6177.74s)]
*  Friend of the pod Sam Merrill and soon to be friend of the pod Ty George like how I know they're in zone [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6182.66s)]
*  But like teams will stop screening with zone or they'll stop cutting like they just get freaked out [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6187.22s)]
*  Orlando's offense is terrible against everybody and every incarnation, but this is [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6191.0199999999995s)]
*  This is one of those deals where [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6199.0199999999995s)]
*  They're like everything seems to be working out for them and they can be a really like, you know [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6201.099999999999s)]
*  We could say how depth is overrated in the playoffs [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6206.86s)]
*  But there's nothing to me that's overrated about options and they have depth and lineups line up options [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6208.9s)]
*  Yeah, and okay, you think about things too [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6214.179999999999s)]
*  You think about that Friday game and again [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6217.58s)]
*  No, Drew no KP, but Tatum had 46 16 and 9 in the Celtics lost at home [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6221.0199999999995s)]
*  Like that's a little alarming they Tatum had I think the best all-around regular season game. I've ever seen him have [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6227.58s)]
*  And especially the rebounds with him, which just every game now it feels like he's gonna get to 10 plus rebounds and 7 plus assists [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6234.0199999999995s)]
*  His decision-making was amazing and the Celtics still lost. So if I'm Cleveland, I feel great about that [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6241.38s)]
*  All right, I think we agree on that and I would still have okay see and I guess the last piece we we didn't [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6246.219999999999s)]
*  Talk about when we probably should really quick is just maybe there's not a lot to talk about that the Lakers I [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6252.94s)]
*  Just think both of us are taking them seriously as a as a real playoff team [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6258.74s)]
*  just because [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6263.5s)]
*  It's two weeks you just have to go four and three to get to the next round [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6266.5s)]
*  Is that a team that can go four and three every two weeks? I think it is [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6269.74s)]
*  So I'm taking them seriously [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6274.34s)]
*  Whether I still feel like Denver is above them and I like your idea of Denver being in the slight layer under the top three [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6275.94s)]
*  I would still have them fourth whether you know like under tiered or whoever and then Lakers Golden State is the next to you [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6282.3s)]
*  I just think is how I'd have it. I wouldn't have the Knicks with those two. I [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6288.7s)]
*  Just don't know how the Knicks defense is gonna be enough. It's too easy scoring them [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6293.0599999999995s)]
*  I know they have Mitchell back now and [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6296.7s)]
*  The lack of depth is right. Let's see if Mitchell's there and round one, then I'm gonna reconsider but I just don't trust it [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6299.46s)]
*  Do you? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6306.5s)]
*  That's a massive leap to be like that team is gonna get through [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6308.7s)]
*  I mean it's less somebody does them a favor so they only have to face one of the two top teams to get through it [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6312.66s)]
*  But how focused are you on Pistons Knicks? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6318.099999999999s)]
*  Cuz I'm like a 10 out of 10. I [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6320.62s)]
*  Love watching the Knicks though, like even with my doubts. I that Knicks Memphis game the other night [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6323.3s)]
*  Awesome. We didn't really do a very good job on the Memphis thing. So let me just end it this way [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6328.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's so much that I like about the team. I think Bain is just solid all the time [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6332.98s)]
*  I don't know that Aldama gets enough credit, you know, they're working a couple other pieces in I think the ED thing [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6338.0199999999995s)]
*  Is still not necessarily great and I don't know if it's cuz he was out there in crunch time that unfriended that I was shocked [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6345.0599999999995s)]
*  Bill Gurley had kind of a tweet that was like I'm really smart and [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6350.9s)]
*  You draft guys are kind of fucking morons [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6354.660000000001s)]
*  It was like the general premise of like overthinking something and ultimately becoming wrong when he was taken and it's like look man [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6357.34s)]
*  I think you're not really [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6363.860000000001s)]
*  Understanding the NBA part of this where [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6367.22s)]
*  There's a lot of teams that'll sit there in the war room going [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6370.38s)]
*  Hey, the guy we're about to draft is not nearly as good as the guy we're passing on. All right [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6374.1s)]
*  Yeah, like they know this these teams are not as stupid as people want to make them out to be [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6378.620000000001s)]
*  but if you're a team that doesn't have a [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6384.42s)]
*  Track record of attracting free agents, right? So you're not a destination franchise [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6389.660000000001s)]
*  you [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6394.900000000001s)]
*  Never use a cap space on anybody. Maybe you don't have necessarily trade assets [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6396.14s)]
*  The reason why players like Edie would go a little bit later in a draft [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6399.740000000001s)]
*  Which we've already covered some of this stuff before is because you feel like they're already close to their ceiling and you're like, hey [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6402.64s)]
*  I know that I'm in Thompson is this or a sir Thompson is this but what if what if [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6407.34s)]
*  this raw [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6414.14s)]
*  like [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6415.860000000001s)]
*  1% athlete who we like his personality like what and I'm not comparing like Thompson going where he went [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6417.14s)]
*  you know, it's it's also different drag classes, but [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6423.46s)]
*  There's there's something you have to understand with teams that when they're selecting guys they know the mistake they're potentially making but they're thinking about [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6428.34s)]
*  the high ceiling part because the addition of [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6435.820000000001s)]
*  Talent is so incredibly challenging in this league more challenging [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6438.46s)]
*  It's tougher to be a GM in basketball than any of the other sports. So for teams that are watching [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6442.02s)]
*  What's that? I'd go football. No way. I [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6447.700000000001s)]
*  Think it's so hard to draft in football. It just seems like it's a fucking crap shoot [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6451.9400000000005s)]
*  But can you imagine having a top four quarter of top four pick right now trying to decide? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6456.620000000001s)]
*  Whether you're gonna get fired if Kim Ward doesn't work out for you. You want to do this? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6461.14s)]
*  I don't know that you're prepared to do this with me. I just think it's harder [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6464.900000000001s)]
*  I'm not I'm not willing to get no our debate about it [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6468.3s)]
*  I just think there's more players. There's more positions [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6472.06s)]
*  Yeah, but the the cap thing is the same for everybody. Okay. Yeah, there's no soft part of it [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6475.900000000001s)]
*  There's no like [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6483.660000000001s)]
*  There's no massive advantage in the five destination cities in the NFL that you have in the NBA [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6486.18s)]
*  So if you're have not in the NBA like you talk and be putting together the best plan ever is anyone ever signing there? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6492.9400000000005s)]
*  Right the NFL doesn't have that you don't even have real you don't even have real free agency in the NFL [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6500.62s)]
*  So on top of like when a guy wants a trade [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6506.34s)]
*  Like hey, or we'll just franchise you and you can miss out on like a top five salary at your position [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6510.179999999999s)]
*  So that took Belichick took the kill Harry over DK Metcalf and AJ Brown [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6517.38s)]
*  Yeah, but he he's he can't drive receivers so that's not a good argument [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6523.660000000001s)]
*  Belichick traded out of the Trent McDuffie pick and passed up on George Carlathus to take Colt Strange. I [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6528.46s)]
*  Just think the draft is like it almost like breaks their brains how stupid some of this shit is NBA [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6535.740000000001s)]
*  NBA is more simple. It's like you going like your Edie point [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6541.34s)]
*  Do we want to take a guy who has a chance to be potentially like an awesome guy someday or do we just take 12 and 9? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6544.860000000001s)]
*  From Zach Edie for the next five years Memphis was like that sounds great. We'll do that [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6550.3s)]
*  Right because then it becomes a debate [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6555.1s)]
*  Is it easier to draft in the NBA or are they better at it? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6556.46s)]
*  And I just when it comes down to the quarterback part of it [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6560.38s)]
*  It's something that we can't criticize for an officer getting wrong. It's the process of evaluating these guys [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6563.820000000001s)]
*  It's just no one's figured it out [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6569.58s)]
*  It's too flawed of a thing all the it'd like be watching somebody run really fast in basketball and his dunks are awesome [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6571.26s)]
*  And then being like look at all that athleticism and quick twitch stuff now, he'll be good at quarterback because we both like dd [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6576.54s)]
*  Yeah, we like he was a rotation guy. We thought he was a rotation guy [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6584.3s)]
*  But a closing guy for the Memphis Grizzlies and that I did not see that I did not see sir [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6587.66s)]
*  And he's also, you know, one of the best post players we've seen in college basketball recent [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6593.34s)]
*  Do you want to guess how many post-ups he has per game right now in the league? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6597.82s)]
*  Doesn't seem like a lot [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6601.5s)]
*  1.6 [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6603.58s)]
*  Yeah, so you're drafting him and you're asking him to post up [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6605.18s)]
*  1.6 times per game. So now we're fed with jock because all jaw does is go to the basket. So then you have zac edie just [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6609.8s)]
*  Kind of wandering around that not not great [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6617.42s)]
*  You can't really post up zac edie and have john marit [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6620.3s)]
*  Another thing for my nfl nba thing. We have seven conversations going on at once here, by the way [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6623.34s)]
*  It's two hours into the pod [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6628.22s)]
*  i'm groggy you can't [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6630.22s)]
*  Bring in a new coach in the nba with [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6632.62s)]
*  Basically the same roster and then just be a completely different team and there's also the math of the games [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6635.1s)]
*  Where a team a couple one score possession games go their way [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6640.62s)]
*  All of a sudden you're a four win team and you go to like a nine win team [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6644.7s)]
*  And you're just like man, we really figured it out. It's like now actually just recovered more fumbles [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6648.7s)]
*  but right there's [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6652.9400000000005s)]
*  There's very little that you can do [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6655.5s)]
*  Um, and then also look in the nba with the way the drafting works the second round guys again [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6658.3s)]
*  The second round thing was like the most overrated thing ever and people just loved that hanky was stockpiling all these second round picks [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6663.26s)]
*  But it was so fucking stupid [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6668.14s)]
*  There's no [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6670.06s)]
*  NBA draft part where you're like, oh in the fourth rounder. We grabbed an all-pro middle linebacker [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6671.42s)]
*  Right [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6677.34s)]
*  That doesn't happen. So I don't know maybe we can maybe we can do this on [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6678.3s)]
*  The hit show ringer.com [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6682.86s)]
*  The hit show team debate [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6685.42s)]
*  team debate [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6688.38s)]
*  I don't know [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6690.7s)]
*  The more the more drafts I watch sometimes it seems like easier than ever like zack edie clearly was gonna be a rotation guy [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6691.98s)]
*  I couldn't believe there was even a dialogue about it. He's seven foot five and he has good hands [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6698.299999999999s)]
*  You're gonna get four good years out of them [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6702.139999999999s)]
*  Wait, so I now I don't even know if we're arguing the same zack edie point. Do you like how about we do this? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6704.46s)]
*  Do you like memphis in the playoffs? No, I don't [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6709.74s)]
*  I don't like memphis or houston [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6714.14s)]
*  I just think it's too early for both of them [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6716.38s)]
*  But is it too early for memphis? Because that's something like this has been [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6719.58s)]
*  A very weird three-year stretch for this team. Okay, to say the least. Yeah, so you go back to 22 [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6723.5s)]
*  And I always like memphis. I like their rawness their anti-establishment [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6730.06s)]
*  You know the next generation of of grit and grind and then when they played whoop that trick in game five against gold state [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6734.22s)]
*  You never got over that. Yeah. Yeah, and I I actually I think I did a monologue because chris vernon sent me just a tear emoji [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6741.26s)]
*  after the open where I went I want golden state to [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6748.38s)]
*  beat [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6753.1s)]
*  Their fucking brains in yeah when they play in game six because I was like you guys are really really feeling yourself [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6754.14s)]
*  You're down three two in a series. Maybe don't play it was it was elimination game three one to three two [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6760.22s)]
*  But it was it was a lot. It was a lot from those guys. And so [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6765.5s)]
*  Then you have the jive shoes, then you have the injury issues. And so [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6770.7s)]
*  like that was a [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6774.379999999999s)]
*  They had a seed not that long ago when they were hurt against the lakers, right where [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6776.62s)]
*  No one gave them a chance necessarily in that series. That was the dylan brooks thing [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6781.339999999999s)]
*  But everybody ended up not liking him all that much. So this is kind of like year four of this group [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6784.62s)]
*  But I I don't know that it's like oh they're incapable because they haven't done anything when they weren't really fully formed in all [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6791.259999999999s)]
*  Don't you feel like they're a regular they're like a regular season team that I just have less faith than the playoffs about because of uh, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6797.26s)]
*  I don't know. I just think teams are gonna have better options in crunch time when we get to april may [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6806.14s)]
*  They're trading baskets in the fourth quarters. I just [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6811.34s)]
*  I also I don't think their defense is as good as I thought it was going to be [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6814.46s)]
*  The teams put up big point numbers on them [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6818.38s)]
*  You notice that? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6821.18s)]
*  Um, they're way more run and gun than I think I was expecting from them this year [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6822.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but they're defensive numbers because I looked it up. No, I know but they'll have these games where they're like [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6827.26s)]
*  126 to 125 shit like that that nicks game was a wild game. That was like not a I will say it was not a defensive game [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6833.16s)]
*  um [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6840.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I got I have the same six that I had before [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6841.900000000001s)]
*  um [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6846.06s)]
*  And next hey robinson looks awesome for them. Maybe we could reevaluate that in a month [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6847.1s)]
*  Do you want to do a quick deep dive before we go? I do what do you want? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6851.9800000000005s)]
*  Um you go we can do it fast. We'll do in like three minutes. I just i'm still on the pyramids to be honest with you [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6855.74s)]
*  Okay, any any new news with the pyramids? [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6863.58s)]
*  Yeah, just because like the last guy that built the pyramid after his you know, the lineage of of rulers [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6866.7s)]
*  um [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6875.259999999999s)]
*  He was like, okay. Well [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6876.46s)]
*  My grandfather did this and then my father did this. So how about we do this? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6878.46s)]
*  I'll build a slightly smaller pyramid [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6883.42s)]
*  Just because the other guys like you really had to sacrifice because basically people were like hey [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6886.46s)]
*  These pyramids take a fucking long time and a lot of resources [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6891.5s)]
*  And maybe this isn't the sweetest deal for your constituents, right? Yeah, so I like that it was [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6896.46s)]
*  It was almost like an ideological shift of the pharaohs [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6903.82s)]
*  That it was like if we're going to do a pyramid, how about [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6907.9s)]
*  Just a little smaller. Yeah. Yeah [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6911.26s)]
*  It felt like a real transition of like I still got to do one [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6915.42s)]
*  I still got to do one [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6919.42s)]
*  But i'm gonna take it easy on you guys. Did they ever master the pyramids? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6921.58s)]
*  Was there ever a moment where like with baseball where they they just figured out guys got to get on base and that's [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6925.74s)]
*  Get on base any way you can [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6932.14s)]
*  So is there a pyramid? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6934.54s)]
*  Is there a pyramid version of obp that matches not putting the ball in play in too many relievers? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6937.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's my question [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6944.14s)]
*  Yeah, I would say probably right at the end right at the end of the third dynasty maybe I could have my [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6948.22s)]
*  My table's wrong, but yeah [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6953.0199999999995s)]
*  I'll check on that [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6955.98s)]
*  What do you got? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6957.5s)]
*  um [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6958.62s)]
*  I really ben and I watched shane gillis on snl last night and had a great time and laughed a lot and I started thinking about [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6959.82s)]
*  How I think he could have been the biggest star on the show in the last 10 years [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6967.18s)]
*  And that sent me down a long deep dive of how he didn't end up on the show and then was watching different clips [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6970.86s)]
*  Here we go. And there was well, hey, we'll leave that aside [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6975.66s)]
*  um [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6979.58s)]
*  There but there's all this different videos and stuff and one of them was this like two-minute video of louis ck [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6980.86s)]
*  Uh, just blistering shane gillis like half half fun [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6988.06s)]
*  But half whatever because he was so mad that he was doing an ad but also about to throw the podcast to a patreon [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6992.0599999999995s)]
*  And he was like how much money do you need to make from this podcast? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=6998.62s)]
*  Do you really need the money that bad and shane gillis is like I actually do [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7002.78s)]
*  um, but I was just down this whole shane gillis rabbit hole thinking about [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7006.219999999999s)]
*  How interesting it would have been if he had just become like wolf arrow on snl [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7010.299999999999s)]
*  And I don't think I was alone with that last night because I thought some of the stuff last night was great [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7013.5s)]
*  The monologue was as awkward as it's ever been [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7017.66s)]
*  um, it's just such a bizarre fit of [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7020.62s)]
*  performer and audience like whoever's in that crowd where they're just [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7023.58s)]
*  Banned behind them, which a lot of people are pointing out the band's like [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7028.139999999999s)]
*  Can we laugh at that one? Can we do that? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7031.58s)]
*  uh, but his sketches and the the couple of beers thing was fucking great. I thought uh, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7033.419999999999s)]
*  If they really felt like they were pushing the envelope a little bit in a way that uh reminded me of some of the best eras of [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7038.7s)]
*  the show [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7044.299999999999s)]
*  and uh, it was just like man what this would have been so interesting if there's this alternate universe where [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7045.419999999999s)]
*  He's just on the shit like nothing happens. He never says the dumb shit and it never comes back to haunt him [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7050.299999999999s)]
*  And he's just on the show [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7055.9s)]
*  Just kind of doing that same ride at that like wolf feral dead and phil hartman some of his other guys like what would have been [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7058.0599999999995s)]
*  The destiny of that anyway, I was deep diving that for an hour last night because I couldn't sleep [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7063.5s)]
*  I saw the couple of beers thing. I haven't watched it yet [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7068.7s)]
*  I did watch the monologue because I mean he even talked about the first monologue [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7072.0599999999995s)]
*  I think he was nervous like it was yeah, he was so good. I've seen him [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7075.9s)]
*  I think four times now whenever he's around like I want to make sure I can go check it out [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7079.5s)]
*  And look, I like them [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7084.7s)]
*  but [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7087.0199999999995s)]
*  Last night, I think there's still this disconnect if people can't understand where he's at [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7087.9s)]
*  And even though it's cadence too. It's like that stop start thing. He does if you're not used to it [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7094.78s)]
*  You're kind of like what's he doing? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7100.38s)]
*  Yeah, like there was obviously like peak [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7102.86s)]
*  Like I remember they did a news a weekend news thing or whatever and they went to some correspondent that was talking about [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7105.58s)]
*  the [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7113.5s)]
*  Movie lineup and then essentially every movie was centered around white male rage, right? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7114.62s)]
*  Yeah, and so whoever the correspondent was that was doing the spoof was just yelling like white male rage [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7120.46s)]
*  And then essentially every movie was centered around white male rage, right? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7125.5s)]
*  Yeah, and so whoever the correspondent was that was doing the spoof was just yelling like white male rage [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7130.86s)]
*  White male and I wasn't offended as a white male. I was offended because it was so fucking stupid [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7135.74s)]
*  it just wasn't funny at all, but I felt like because of [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7140.0599999999995s)]
*  Wherever we were at in our discussions at least as a country at the time [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7144.38s)]
*  It was like almost a cool thing to try to do [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7147.82s)]
*  And it just didn't didn't work. It wasn't really funny and now i've looked at different s&l clips [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7150.7s)]
*  It's like oh you can see the shift a little bit be like maybe 100% [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7155.66s)]
*  Maybe some of this pandering stuff that we were doing or maybe it was people internally that worked on the show [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7158.86s)]
*  We're like, no, these are important things like we're gonna do you can see there's been a very clear shift of like let's actually start making [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7163.66s)]
*  fun of [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7169.1s)]
*  Both sides a little bit more than we were so then [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7169.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if that sets the tone for like what gilis is walking into but I think some people look at gilis and think [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7173.18s)]
*  Was and he talks about trump when he comes out says i'm going to miss trump being in debates [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7179.42s)]
*  That for some people it's like this massive red flag that goes off like oh this guy's a trump guy, you know, he's white [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7184.46s)]
*  He's from pa [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7190.379999999999s)]
*  Like clearly he's a trump guy then he goes right for biden right after right? So I don't think [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7191.82s)]
*  First of all, I don't think he's a conservative. Some people think he is [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7197.42s)]
*  and the way that [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7200.78s)]
*  Like that'll like it'll happen with certain people like they'll already be like triggered to go [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7202.86s)]
*  Oh, no, like this is a trump a pro trump comedian out here because he just said i'm gonna and then he makes fun of trump [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7208.62s)]
*  The whole fucking time. Yeah, so he's kind of just making fun of everybody there the whole time [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7214.139999999999s)]
*  I'd ask you this though like him getting bounced [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7218.46s)]
*  I knew who he was but not as as good and then pretty quickly. I was like man. This guy is [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7221.74s)]
*  He's probably my favorite going right now [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7227.74s)]
*  I think he's really smart on top of being like the guys that play the goofy thing [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7229.74s)]
*  But also are incredibly smart with the way they structure the stuff that they're doing is always going to like make me want [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7234.22s)]
*  Like i'm like, okay i'm in this isn't just [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7239.820000000001s)]
*  Set up set up joke or whatever. I think there's some layers to the stuff that he's doing that's really impressive to me [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7242.9400000000005s)]
*  but do you think [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7247.900000000001s)]
*  Do you think that changed because it at the time it felt like and i'm doing a bad job with this [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7249.5s)]
*  That was the best thing that happened to him because it put him on everybody's radar [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7254.38s)]
*  But you think the long-term ceiling for him back to the zacke thing. I don't think it was the best thing [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7258.860000000001s)]
*  I think I think it was bad for him. Okay, you do go. Yeah, I do. I I think it set him back a couple years [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7263.18s)]
*  um [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7269.02s)]
*  but and but ultimately became part of his story and he got over it, but um, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7270.06s)]
*  You know, I don't think it was I don't think it was good for him that that thing that really helped him was put in [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7274.700000000001s)]
*  That communist special on youtube [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7278.780000000001s)]
*  And it was just great the one I think he did it in austin whatever that was the one when ben was like [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7281.18s)]
*  Who's this guy and we were just we'd watch it over and over again and we thought [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7286.54s)]
*  It was just so fucking funny like the trump stuff everything the isis thing when I saw the isis thing live in arizona [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7290.700000000001s)]
*  I I mean he just had everybody [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7298.54s)]
*  I mean his whole premise was I and again like that's a pretty good example of what we're talking about [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7300.700000000001s)]
*  I don't think he actually is cheering for isis, right? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7304.860000000001s)]
*  But his whole story and playing it out of getting you to understand why he's rooting for isis for all of the reasons that he's laying out [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7308.700000000001s)]
*  Like that's brilliant shit, man [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7316.38s)]
*  Yeah, well and that's also that was the bones of snl and it was a lot of the snl 50 stuff [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7318.38s)]
*  Um when they're going back through the old cast and you think like that 70s cast especially [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7323.82s)]
*  Part of what made made that great was they just didn't give a shit. They tried everything and now you think he has a sandler [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7328.62s)]
*  Like potential sandler timeline that's not reachable now [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7335.58s)]
*  I what do you mean? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7340.06s)]
*  Well, if he's if he's the main guy and he's really funny he's on snl for [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7342.14s)]
*  10 years feels long today [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7346.06s)]
*  I think it would have been like five years and I think he probably would have done stand-up stuff and then [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7347.42s)]
*  I don't know what the next thing is, but I think he'd be [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7352.06s)]
*  I think it would have been really good for him [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7355.18s)]
*  And I also think the show needed somebody like him, which was I think the reason lauren [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7357.26s)]
*  The new lauren buck that came out has a little piece on it [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7361.5s)]
*  Like he wanted a different type of cast member than they had and somebody that did a lot of stuff shane did so I think it would [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7364.14s)]
*  Have been really good for him. I also think he would have played trump [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7370.3s)]
*  Which would have been huge for him because he's really good at it and you've seen him do it a bunch of times anyway [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7372.86s)]
*  Good deep dive. Uh, anything you got to plug before we go? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7378.219999999999s)]

*  What do you have? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7452.299999999999s)]

*  It's very clear chalamet would come on with you if he knew the request was in I feel like people don't know how big [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6cPdVKiEc&t=7481.02s)]
